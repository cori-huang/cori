taz fan mount!,"i had success with this design:

http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:147966

i used the lulzbot fan (http://www.lulzbot.com/?q=products/12vdc-fan-40mm). 

unfortunately i didn't think to measure how long the wires i ran were before i closed up the patient, so i can't tell you the length you'll need. just grab a couple spools of 26awg wire. a pre-joined red/black pair would be ideal. personally i spliced together extra wires cut from an install of a replacement y-axis stepper motor.  

i ran the wires through the x-axis harness without much trouble (it was nicely cut all along its length), cutting and replacing zip ties as i went. got to the rambo enclosure and opened it up (being careful of the enclosure fan). 

unscrewed the three bolts on the bottom of the rambo box, to loosen the clamp for the wire harnesses, which made it relatively easy to get a pair of foreceps through the x-axis harness entrance, grab the wires, and pull them in.

cut and stripped the wires. on the board, i used the plugs already referenced by orias here:

http://www.newark.com/te-connectivity-b ... locks_none

this diagram (http://reprap.org/wiki/file:rambo-conn-all.jpg) obsucres that red goes on the right-side pin. you can confirm with this one (http://reprap.org/wiki/file:rambo-conn-aux.jpg) or by looking at the board itself. 

on the other end, i cut the existing plug off of the fan power wires, spliced it to the wires i just ran, soldering and patching the insulation with heat-shrink. tried to be careful there. it's going to be moving around, and i want it to last.

once everything was connected, i was able to test in printrun with:
code: select allm106 s255 
to turn it on, and 
code: select allm106 s0
to turn it off.

i attached the fan mount using two 16mm long m3 bolts. had to drill out the holes to get them properly sized. chicken and egg - i had to print the fan mount without a fan mount, it came out pretty messy.  

the fan mount's author mentions using heat set nuts to attach the fan to the mount; i found 6-3/4 wood screws worked fine too.  the fan's labeled side faced into the duct. or another way to be sure you dont get it backwards; you want to be driving the screws/bolts into the side where there's a circular indentation around the bolt hole. or, just remember which way the air blew when you had it turned on.  the duct's shape is such that, when running, much of the air will rebound out against the fan; this might make you wonder if you got it backwards at first, as it did me.

the result looks like this:



 fan mounted and working 




 fan mount up close 


you can see here that this fan/mount combo does not intersect either the bed clamps or the z-axis threaded bolt at all. my compliments to the designer. 

i discovered all my existing slic3r configs already had the fan enabled, so there was nothing extra to do there. 

results pretty much speak for themselves. for this stl (taken from here: https://github.com/alexrj/slic3r/wiki/calibration):

that's an immediate, dramatic improvement in pla output quality right out of the gate. i haven't even started tuning settings on it yet.","neotheghost wrote:i figured that whenever you use a funnel like fan mount you loose a lot of the cooling power of the fan. this open frame construction allows 100% air flow and works much better as the funnel mounts out there.

you can download it here:
http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:529264

how do you figure that? purpose of the funnel is to direct the cooling to where it needs to be, around the nozzle to cool the plastic as it is laid down. this prevents droops, sags, and many other print quality issues. print quality issues like the fan ""mount"" you made for example (supports needed also). if you're experiencing lack of cooling from a funnel type mount then your exit is too restrictive, going in the other direction and giving the fan's airflow zero guidance towards where it is needed is not the answer.

yes, very low res tests with machines not properly calibrated. the droops and sags seen are due to improper cooling. the taz 6 also has dual 24v extruder fans (with the air directed at the nozzle, mind you), a heatsink fan, and an all-metal hot end. along with auto-leveling, if using the right settings in cura, you should never see prints like those in this thread which were printed on what looks like taz 4?"
taz 5 hardened steel hs+ 1.2mm troubleshooting,"hi, i just bought a hardened steel hs+ 1.2mm nozzle with the understanding that i could produce high strength prints with it.  so far nylon (pro nylon from matterhackers) seemed to not do well.  nylon 910, better but not great.  any suggestions?  i have had the fan off.  if i engage the print cooling fan, i get better results as far as resolution, but the layer adhesion is poor.","a 1.2mm nozzle is a very big nozzle and i would have to assume that with a material like nylon where you can't really use a cooling fan you will have to print real slow.  you will have to print slow anyway if you are using a standard hex heater block and not something like an e3d volcano since it won't be able to keep up with melting that much filament.

i've never tried printing with a nozzle that big but just as a guess i would think max speed would be 15-20mm/s speed.  i could be wrong and it may need to be even slower."
turn off z-motors during print,"i am looking for help with what might be an unusual request.  i would like raise the print head of  lulzbot taz 6 off of the print bed prior to staring a print.  after raising the printer head i want to turnoff the z motors so the print head will not rise any further during the print.  but i want the printer to ""think"" it is still operating ""normally.""  i have no idea if any of this is possible or even how to do it.  any help or insight would be greatly appreciated.","there is a statement  code: select all#define disable_z true in marlin to allow this behavior after a timeout (motor inactivity). if you have the auto bed leveling (abl) enabled, the z steppers will always be enabled because the timeout will always reset since the z motors are constantly compensating for bed leveling. if you disable abl (and perhaps backlash comp? - not sure if that is needed) and run the command code: select allm18 z e will disable the z motors immediately. i have never tried this, but my guess is that they will stay disabled until a move command that moves z is executed."
mintemp yada yada,"hello all, 
i have a taz 5 with dual extruder v3. i only got to use it for a month or so before i had to go abroad for work. 6 months later i'm back and got the taz all setup, upgraded the firmware and was ready to go. mintemp err halted please reset. every single time so far. 

i did a search on this and the amount of topics was a bit overwhelming. but obviously there is something going on for it to be occurring so much. 

has there been a single thing or consensus that is causing this? i saw the post about the dual is the serial number is a certain set. mine isn't one of those. and my printer is pretty tip top. any clues would be appreciated. 

frustrated but optimistic 
shaun","it sounds like you have the wrong firmware installed. if you have firmware for a dual extruder, you should get an error related to the extruder number. ie: mintemp err e0 or mintemp err e1
if you are just getting mintemp err, then i would think the firmware is for a single extruder configuration."
belt tightening?,is it possible to tighten the belts? or do you have to install new ones when they get too loose?,"the belts are not a continuous loop, there's a clamp that locks in each end of the strip of belt.  it's under the table for the y axis, and behind the extruder mount on the x axis.  use an allen wrench, loosen the clamp, use a needle-nose pliers to grasp the end of the belt and tug it gently tighter, then whilst holding the belt tension with the pliers with one hand, and holding the table or print head stationary with the other hand, use your third hand (  ) to tighten the screws down.  done."

new taz pro 2nd extruder not lowering,"we just purchased 2 new taz pros and have 4 other taz6s in our inventory.  on one of the taz pro's the 2nd extruder will not lower.  we have tried printing with it and it does print but from the upper (i.e. not lowered) position which is clearly not correct.  we did a quick inspection and could not find anything immediately wrong.  i have opened a support ticket and we have been dragging our feet a little bit since the other taz pro appears to be working fine and i have 20+ other printers to maintain, but now with the pending  aleph problems, i am very concerned about getting help before help is no longer available.

sorry i have not done more troubleshooting, but i will this week.  i am just hoping for a quick point in the right direction.  thanks in advance.  you can find out at:  www.makerspaceusna.com","bmarsh wrote: ?sun oct 27, 2019 9:03 am
my leading option right now is to consider donating the machine to someplace that can (a) give me a tax write off and (b) has someone willing to tinker with it far more than i am.

i will say that i also have the sl toolhead and it prints with that ok, so perhaps the issue is “only” a faulty dual extruder toolhead (basically the only reason i bought this machine).


sorry for the double post but these are both good points.

i might be able to help you on the first point.  i work for a government and educational institution and we have a foundation that accepts gifts.  if you are serious about donating, we might be able to accept and give you a write off or you can claim that you gave to an educational instituition.  i teach a 3d printing class and manage several undergrad projects - for example, last year we took 1 of my good taz6s and tried to convert it to print ultem following nasa specs.  sadly we have not finished yet so we ""trashed"" that printer for now as well.

i think i have an sl toolhead laying around also so maybe will go that route.

you can pm me for discussion or easily look me up at www.makerspaceusna.com.  thanks again."
lulzbot taz 6 - aerostruder homing issue,"hello everyone,

i have been using lulzbot printers for a while now, and mostly could figure out issues on my own, but this time i'm stuck.

i was using my lulzbot printer with a aerostruder no problem, until the day that i had a catastrophic failure and had to switch to a flexydually as a backup extruder until i got parts to fix my aerostruder.

fixed the aerostruder but now my printer refuses proper home, we all know that lulzbot taz 6 should home x and y and them home a little bit to home z using the z-button, right, mine is not doing that.... i have quadruple checked firmwares, tried all different versions of marlin that i could get my hands on aka: http://download.lulzbot.com/software/marlin/

if i return the firmware and the flexydually everything works    

video of the weird homing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyww3__ ... e=youtu.be

video of if properly homing after flashing flexidually: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqr37tv ... e=youtu.be

i'm truly lost, if someone has any idea let me know!

just one fyi: i'm a software developer, even compiled my own versions of marlin back on the day of getting taz 5 and capacitive sensors to level the printer bed.","nopick wrote: ?tue oct 29, 2019 6:57 am
have you tried flashing anything from the newest version of lb cura or are you only flashing files from the download site?


i have tried using the lb cura, and manual download hex file, i also thought about the incorrect firmware but that theory got dismissed as i downloaded really old firmware for the aerostruder and the issue persisted.
joebowler300 wrote: ?tue oct 29, 2019 7:48 am
i assume you did select the aerostruder print head and didn’t leave it on the flexy dually?


yes, if you see the video, you can check the the firmware loaded shows aerostruder."
taz 6 sd card reader not reading files,"my new lulzbot taz 6 3d printers are not working properly.

when i insert the sd card that came with the printers, it is correctly reading/finding the pre-downloaded lulzbot files that came with the machine.

when i save my own .stl files on the same sd card, the sd card reader is not finding my personal files.  it only finds the pre-loaded lulzbot files. 

this is happening on all of my lulzbot taz 6 printers. 

i tried using new sd cards with no luck.

any help is appreciated as i am relying on using sd cards for my students to do their printing.

thank you kindly.","the problem may be in the sd card reader/writer you’re using to write your .stl files.  if you have access to another pc with an sd card reader/writer try that.  a laptop’s sd card reader/writers seem more reliable then a desktop pc’s, imo.

the sd card reader/writer in my pc was so unreliable and frustrating i resorted to buying this external usb interface sd card reader/writer.

taz pro owners -- do you recommend it?,"i have a taz 6 and love it.  i use it for business to make parts that go into things i sell, and sometimes need more production capacity.  i've been thinking about adding a taz pro, but am a little surprised by the lack of online reviews and buzz.  is the tax pro in production and shipping to customers in the us now?  anyone here have one and care to comment on how it is working?  is it as reliable and jam-free as the taz 6?  dual extruder working as advertised?  print quality? etc., etc....  thanks.","unfortunately i purchased one and have had non-stop issues with it. the filament run out sensors didn't work which was stopping my prints until i figured out to deactivate it. my prints also weren't coming out very good even when using polymax pla or ngen which are usually rock solid. my ninjaflex was oozing all over the place no matter what settings i chose and looked like garbage etc. etc. finally in the last week or so it has stopped working and was shuddering and crashing. it's now been sent back to the distributor to sort out. 

i'll update this post once/if i get it back. to be honest though the taz 6 with aerostruder i have has a far better print quality. i've had to set it back up and use it and have been shocked how much better it is than the pro i had. i'm hoping that i just got a dud - like i got a dud aerostruder with faulty thermistor originally - and that i will get a pro that actually works soon.

so for me it has been extremely unimpressive, but i'm hoping that i am just a lone person with a dud one. if it could work like it is supposed to it would be great and more flexible than an ultimaker (which i now wish i'd purchased...). i wasn't going to post anything until i was sure if it was a random dud one but given this is the second time i've been given a faulty taz product i thought i should let others know as there's pretty much nothing out there about these new printers."

xy shift after pause to clean blob off of print,"i'm running a taz 6 with an aerostruder toolhead on a 24 hour print.  about 10 hours in, i paused the print as a moderate sized glob of pla dripped down onto the print, and i wanted to clean it off before it caused problems.  after cleaning, i resumed the print, which seemed to begin again fine. unfortunately after about 30 minutes it became apparent that the x,y coords had been distorte by about a quarter of an inch on both axis. 

curious if anyone has ran into this problem and has a good solution.  thanks! 

(i did recently update firmware, about a week ago, i can check when i'm at the printer & post back with version.)","we are having the same problem, but it only looks like on y axis so far. it started showing itself last week. i figured it was just because the screws in the guides under the bed were loose.
nope. it seems to be getting progressively worse.
the bed moves smoothly by hand and the sheave on the y motor is tight.
im basically lost at this point."
using loctite on a taz5 e3d hotend,"my taz 5 has an e3d hotend.  everytime i change the nozzle, the heat block comes loose from the thermal tube.  i was wondering if adding some heat resistant loctite to keep the heat block from coming loose would work.  would this cause any issues?","the old v2 hexagon hot ends used to use locktite, so it's reasonable. however, the volcano hot ends on the v3 dual extruder do not. i would check the assembly instructions on e3d's website. you can start your search here: https://e3d-online.dozuki.com/"
z height changing during print.,"guys, i'm having an issue where the it appears that the z-stop position is changing on me during printing.   i have been unable to determine if its the extruder coming closer to the bed or the bed coming to the extruder.  (taz 4 frame, upgraded to hexagon hot end with the modular print bed) 

here are some example photos.  i am printing ten objects one at a time, abs plastic 270c extruder and 100c bed temp.  as you can see on the right side in the middle the extruder gets so close to the bed it cannot extrude the skirt and makes a mess out of the bottom few layers on the part.  the error occurs on part number 6 and it then goes on to print the other 4 pieces correctly.  i don't know if it shows it in the photo but the part directly in front of and directly behind also have some squish in the first few layers.  this would lead me to think that i have a high spot on the glass.  










(sorry pics have rotated 90 degrees)


except the plot thickens.  
yesterday i was printing another ten objects of a larger size (different gcode from above).   just as it finished the last object i paused the printer and cleaned the bed of all completed pieces and restarted the job.   the printer homed the x,y and z axis and started extruding the skirt around the first object.   i noticed immediately that the extruder was to close to the glass because of how the skirt was being printed.  i decided to let the print finish.  now the high-spot has moved to the front row of connectors, you can see how the skirts are not even and incomplete on the front row. 



 front row 


for a while now every time i start a new print job i have to reset the z height.  i can set it, print a 10hr job, let the printer cool off, bring the extruder and bed back up to temp and then check the zheight and it will be off.  normally it is always too high and i have to adjust the zstop down.   i have swapped the micro switch on the zstop for the one on the xaxis but that didin't make a difference.  

i have also noticed as everything comes up to temperature the distance between the extruder and bed decreases as everything warms up.

is there a way to have pronterface display a an absolute z measurement so that i could see if the z comes back to the same spot each time?  i tried using an m114 command but when i home the z axis m114 just shows 0 on z.  if i adjust the zstop so that i have the correct clearance and home z again m114 just shows 0 again.  what i am trying to do is get the software to show me where z stops at each time to rule out if the extruder is coming back to the same spot each time.","so here is a follow up.  

got a good straight edge and started checking my bed for flatness.  
when cold the glass sags in the middle of the bed.  
crank up the heat 100c  put the straight edge back on the glass and guess what.  its now flat in the x direction and i have a hump in the y direction on the right hand side of the bed, where the parts were getting mashed.  

solution: 
i removed the clamps from the glass bed at the corners and i have been running it trouble free for weeks now.   i think what was happening was the glass was expanding as it warmed.  with the corners being held in place and supported from underneath by the aluminum plate the glass had no were to go but up.   removing the clips allowed the glass to expand an lay flat.  
i would give you a measurement of the cold and hot glass, but i don't have calipers that big. 

the thing that puzzles me is why didn't it do it on the left hand side also?"
my taz6 can't determine firmware version,"i have two taz 6's, running the latest cura (cura-lulzbot_3.6.20_win32) .. i've followed the installation instructions to delete the lulzbot cache.. 
however, when i update the firmware to (v1.1.9.34) within cura, i get the following pop-up error message on one of the printers.  ""failed to determine installed firmware version"".. i can cancel it and continue printing.. but i'd like to fix the problem.. does anyone have any ideas or pointers, as to what's wrong?  
thanks robert","hopefully you don't have both printers hooked up to your computer at the same time. that could be an issue.

i would also update your cura to 3.6.20, uninstall any previous versions of cura and then clear your cache according to the download instructions on the web site. then add a new printer and update your firmware. you'll want to back up any custom profiles you made before you start.

then with your computer connected to your printer, you can open the console and type m115 in the bottom text box. it should tell you if you have the right firmware for your machine.

if you don't get any information, it means that your printer is not connected to your computer. in which case, change your usb connection, change out your usb cable or check to see if your usb slot is loose on your rambo."
can't replace thermistor,"after cleaning off a huge glob of pla off the hot end on my taz 6, i shorted the heating cartridge (both 5 amp fuses have been replaced, that part is working now) and tore what i can only assume to be the thermistor wire. pretty confident its the  thermistor wire because i'm getting a ""err: mintemp eo"" and when i look there appears to be a really thin wire that is broken and is in the thermistor spot in the wire harness. i don't even remotely have the electrical knowledge to use those cheap multi-meters to test the resistance so i don't know for sure.

i looked on the forums and a post said to replace it with this: https://www.lulzbot.com/support/100k-se ... thermistor however there is no option to buy it. looking elsewhere online, none of the pictures look like the one on lulzbot's website so i don't know whether they are the right ones. 

can anyone link me a thermistor for the lulzbot taz 6 with the stock single extruder?


edit: 
i'm wondering if  this will work as a replacement if i trim down the length and add a crimp terminal on the end?","mmmmm i think this is the one you want - https://www.lulzbot.com/support/100k-se ... stor-235mm
however, they’re out of stock too.  i think the most important thing is that it’s a 100k thermistor.  however the one lulzbot used was of 3mm diameter, the one you found is 1.8mm.  look around on amazon and e-bay and match up the specs.  if that fails then you can go straight to the source of lulzbot print head parts in the uk here - https://e3d-online.com/lulzbot-spares.  relatively expensive with vat and shipping so... if you can find on amazon or e-bay that’ll be the cheaper option.

also, be sure to remove the tiny allen head screw that holds in the thermister and you may have to heat up the block (source of heat like an electric heat gun) for thermal expansion and than pound it out of there with a small screw driver or ice pick kinda tool.  you just may have to do a full disassembly to do this.  yes, it’s a real pita!  in fact, it may be easier to get a new heater block and swap it out; might be best to get one as a spare, along with the heating element.  good luck to you!"
lulzbot taz 6 homing failed,"hi,
totally newbie here... 
a friend of my loaned a printer he got, but haven't used that much... but it worked for him.

now as i tried to get a first print out -- i can't get it to work at all.

it tried to do autolevel, but when i watched it doing it, it seemed off. what i mean, that the nozzle was not hitting that metallic button, it was partly hitting the left corner metal plate. and after that it tried to clean the nozzle, but then it was grinding the nozzle over the metallic button, which it was supposed to use when doing the autoleveling.

so i looked at some videos at youtube and compared those to this, it seems that the alignment of the table is totally off.
the nozzle is not hitting the right place when trying to do auto level or homing. 

now the nozzle / extruder is stuck behind the table... so it cannot get to home.

i dont know what to do with this ? how do i totally re-align the table / bed... and reset the system to defaults or something ?","can you upload detailed pictures of the printer setup, or perhaps a video of it running with closeups on the areas that fail?

there are a few things that can cause improper operation.
improper firmware loaded
bed not mounted in proper location
x carriage not leveled

the firmware assumes printer geometry based on the configuration it was compiled for (printer and toolhead combo). if you have the wrong firmware loaded, then most likely the movements will be off. if the printer was actually working previously, this is probably unlikely, but worth confirming. if the bed is not mounted in the proper location on the frame, all these values will be off. there are 4 3d printed mounting brackets on the main frame that the 3d printed brackets on the bed frame interface with. then there is a thumb screw that locks each bracket set together. confirm that the bed is located properly. finally, since each side of the x carriage has its own z screw and motor, it is possible for them to get out of sync during transportation when the motors are off. this will cause one side to be higher than the other side and will result in a slope when the z carriage is moved. a small slope is ok, but if it is large enough that it is outside the acceptable range of the auto bed leveling, it will cause the auto bed leveling to abort.the best way to correct any slope is to manually position the nozzle so that it is just touching the front left bed washer. then, shut the motors off and slide the head over to the front right bed washer. if the head has space above the washer, manually turn the right lead screw motor via the coupler with your hand to lower it until the nozzle touches the washer. if the head is lower than the right washer, turn the lead screw so that it clears. this will level the x carriage enough so that abl doesn't detect a our-of-range problem."
replacement e3d thermistor,"hello all,

i have a taz5 with a dual v3 head on it and recently had to replace the thermistor.  i used a e3d thermistor (e-semitec-50-molex) that is available on amazon.  it seem to be the same encapsulated unit (semitec 104gt) that is originally on the head, and worked well for a few prints.  then the temp reading dropped by around 8 deg when idle and cool as compared to the other head (and bed) and who knows how much lower when hot.  this started causing issues with prints, so i figured i got a bad one and replaced it again.  same issue.  is there something wrong with these compared to the ones lulzbot doesn't appear to sell anymore?  it there a bad way to install these?  i soldered the molex connector to my lines and can now replace it easily using the molex connector it comes with.  clamped it in with only light force on the screw.","it’s difficult to say if you got the correct one or not, i don’t think you did.  this is the one you want - https://www.lulzbot.com/store/parts/100 ... stor-235mm
as that is the one that’s used in the v3 dual print head.  none are available on lulzbot website and i couldn’t find any on amazon or e-bay.  amongst other things yes you did pick a bad time to have printer problems.  the best solution i can offer is to purchase one here: https://e3d-online.com/lulzbot-spares

buy several and supply the community as their problems arise, help offset the increased cost from having to purchase from across the pond.  good luck!"
auto calibrate,what should an auto calibrate should look like on a taz workhorse? i attempted one and all it did was crash the print head around hitting limits and causing the belt to jump teeth and then drag the nozzle across my bed scratching the surface?? i immediately shut it off as that just doesn't look right.,"i wouldn't really worry about auto calibrating your taz workhorse. it works a lot like a taz 6. i would go back to your qa sheet or test exceptance record and enter those settings in. the only thing that you'll have to worry about is your z-offset. your workhorse should autolevel when you turn on the machine.

you'll want to make sure that you have the latest version of cura, that you uninstalled any earlier versions and that you cleaned your cache according to the download instructions.

wiring conflict?,"i am a taz 4 owner that has upgraded over time to a taz 5 config. a while back, i bought the hexagon se and followed these wiring instructions for the blower motor to the rambo board. now i've purchased a dual extruder toolhead v3 following these instructions, which reference these instructions to wire the blower motor to the second extruder port... but the pins in the dual extruder setup overlap the pins required for the hexagon hotend. what gives? are we out of io? can i jumper to support both configs simultaneously (since in either case, it would be an open circuit on the toolhead on the pair not used)? what's the intended approach here?

edit: i should clarify, i failed to notice that the new harness for the second extruder failed to power my blower motor, and i now have a pla jam... any hints for removing it? i've tried stopping the blower fan (now that it's powered) and heating to 230c... but i can't push or pull the filament after 20 minutes (i've managed to snap it above the toolhead from the force i've tried applying to get it out). any other techniques? i'm pretty sure i'm dealing with the dreaded heat creep...","different firmwares enable different pins in pinout.h. all taz's from 1 to 6 essentially use the same rambo board with minor changes, but which pins were used for which purpose on which firmwares changed over time. you should follow the taz 5 instructions."

something is off on my taz 6, but i can't identify what it is. 

every print starts out great. at some point while filling in the bottom layer, the first - fourth layers get messy, dragging, spotty, and underextrude, as if there is a clog. the printer quickly rights itself, but the first four layers end up consistently not being attached to the rest of the print - separated off. 

i've worked with lulzbots for about five years and solved multiple issues, but this one seems a bit odd. it's a pretty new taz 6. 

my only guess is there is something off with the fan.

side fans stopped working,"i had started a different thread about my filament getting chewed up, eliminating different things brought me to this... it turns out that my side fans (taz 6, default single print head) are not starting. the console command to turn them on does not work. so what are the steps to troubleshoot this?

regards","yes that is the correct diagram!  to use the console commands you must have the usb cable connected to the printer and computer (i assume you do).  start cura, click on the monitor tab, under the manual control section click on the connect button, then click on the console button.  the console screen will appear.  to move the z-axis upward 25mm enter g0 z25  move it back down in the opposite direction simply make the number negative g0 z-25.  to move the x or y axis simply replace the letter z with the letter x or the letter y.

to view your z offset enter m851
send all your axis to their home positions type g28

looks like typing m106 only would turn on your heat sink cooling fan.  if no fan index is given, the print cooling fan is selected.  there's 3 fans so you need to pass the index value of the fan you're trying to turn on.  i assume 0, 1 or 2 would be the index numbers (preceded by the letter (p)).  so try m106 p1.  see if one of the side fan comes on at full speed (full speed of 255 is default if the speed value is not specified (with the letter s)).  then type m107 to turn the fan off.  turn the fan on at approx. half speed m106 p1 s128.  you can read about the fan speed and other gcode commands here: http://marlinfw.org/docs/gcode/m106.html

i don't know 100% the steps to tell you how to test the fans through the lcd panel but it shouldn't be too hard to scroll through the few menus and find it.  currently i have the aerostruder print head installed and there's only one fan on it.  to turn the fan on i need to go to temperature -> fan speed 1: and turn the knob to the fan speed i want (0-255).  yours should be somewhat similar to that.

know that a lot of times the side cooling fans don't turn on for the first layer to allow for better adhesion to the build plate.  so its possible that your side cooling fans not working assessment may be incorrect; but its fun to learn these commands anyways.  "

duel v3 heat creep fix,"hey folks,

i know i'm late to the party, but i managed to fix my lulzbot taz 6 duel extruder v3 heat creep issues by replacing the 40mm fan that comes shipped with an 80mm fan from noctura. the modification uses all the same bolts as the original fan and secures the new fan to the converter with the rubber bits that come with it. i directly swapped the wires that went to the old fan into the new fan. before this i spent several months tinkering with settings with no success but with this modification i got perfect prints in pla and pva with default settings in my first print. i have since run prints which continued without error for over 24 hours. i've attached the modification plans and the stl of converter/duct i am using on my printer. the one i have installed is printed in petg.

i haven't been printing on my taz 6 since spring of this year (roughly 6 months ago).  last material i used was taulman 910, and i'd been having trouble with getting the nozzle clean since the wipe temp can't be cranked past 200 °c in cura (at least in v3.2.32, not sure if there's been an update).  had a small project i wanted to print today, and was having a heck of a time getting the nozzle clean so i could get past probing.  i spent roughly an hour cranking the nozzle temp all the way to 290 °c, wiping aggressively with paper towel and scotch-brite, and i still couldn't get the probe sequence past the second washer, with the first being heavily deflected.

i know i'm not supposed to use anything metal on the nozzle, so the next most aggressive thing i could think of was (might wanna sit down for this) sandpaper.  i grabbed some 320 grit, and with the nozzle at room temp, cleaned it up until i could see brass all the way around.  then i cranked the temp up and gave it a little bit more sanding until i wasn't seeing any more material on the sanding sheet.  next probe sequence executed perfectly, zero deflection, and i'm currently happily printing away.

now, i've admittedly probably scratched up the nozzle a little bit.  i imagine the higher the grit the better if following this procedure, but it's definitely at your own risk.  if you're at your wits end trying to get the nozzle clean, though, i'd say it's worth a shot.

*edit*

i should probably specify that i'm using the aerostruder head, in case it makes a difference."

thanks for any info you can provide!","i have a few aerostruders that i converted to 1.75mm
the biggest issue is that the titan aero for 1.75mm filament is shorter than the 2.85mm version, this causes the fan shroud to collide with the bed leveling washers.
what you need to do is modify a 2.85mm titan and drill out the heat break threads with a 6mm drill bit and then run a m7 tap through it. you have to be careful and keep checking how far the heat break goes in. you want the shoulder of the 1.75mm heat break to be level with the bottom surface of the titan. you also need to drill out the hole on the top so that a piece of pfte tubing can pass through from the heat break to the filament guide (i'm not sure what size i used) after that you just need a 1.75mm filament guide that comes with the titan kits and a piece of pfte tubing and trim to the right length (i don't remember how long that was either)

in the meantime we can make sure there is not a partial obstruction in the nozzle. you can also make sure that your micro blower (the small fan pointed towards the hot end) is working and coming on at full blast as soon as you turn on the printer. if that is coming on then we can make sure that filament is able to be manually extruded just fine. to do this, bring your hot end up off the build plate and up to printing temperature. once at temp, open your idler and using a 2.5mm hex wrench, manually push the filament through the hot end. your filament should extrude in a solid consistent line. if nothing is able to extrude or it comes out like a ""pigtail"" then there is likely an obstruction that needs to be cleared. a good way to try to clear this is with cold pulls, you can find some helpful links that go over cold pulls below:

solved: taz 6 auto leveling is >0.5mm off (now perfect to 0.01mm!),"edit: solved this - read the fifth post below  for a method to determine if your bed is physically out-of-level (mine was >0.5mm off, more than auto-leveling could address), and a technique to get your automatic bed leveling to within 0.01mm at each corner.

i am having problems with automatic bed leveling.  the result after leveling is the front-left corner and the back-right corners are a >0.5mm different than the other two corners.  

i have done the following...
- with automatic leveling off (m420 s0), i've manually leveled z to ensure the physical system is level (note: if i leave automatic leveling off, it is better than turning it on)
- verified that the washer thickness is the consistent between the corners (it is within .01mm)
- verified that the distance from the bottom of the aluminum bed to the top of the washer is the consistent (it is within .02mm)
- verified that the distance from the bottom of the aluminum bed to the top of the heated bed is the consistent (it is also within .02mm)
- swapped washers, standoffs and flexible corners between the sides (no change), and cleaned under and around all of them.
- i have verified that leveling is ""working"" by placing a thick washer on top of one corner washer and the resulting z position is correctly offset on future moves
- measured the deflection on the x bar to ensure that wasn't adding to the problem (it isn't, and the problem is opposite corners not side-to-side)
- i have changed firmware to latest release, and then back to 1.1.5 and no change.
- i am not using any software, just manual g-code commands (m420 s0, g28, g29, g1 in that order)
- i have done a ""restore failsafe"" on the firmware with no change in behavior
- i am able to get great small-to-medium prints at the center of the bed when i adjust z-offset correctly, but large prints consistently are a problem as i can't offset sufficiently for this.
- i have tried adding spacers to raise the back-left and front-right washers above the heated bed (increasing the measured gap by about .6mm) and then leveling gets very close, but i'm unable to adjust z-offset sufficiently (i have to now offset more than -2mm, which is the maximum of z-offset).  

i'm quite lost here - since the measurements from the aluminum bed to washer/heated bed are within .02, and i've verified leveling is working - so i don't see why the resulting automatic leveling is off by more than 0.5mm.  

any help would be appreciated,

i think (hope...?) i have solved this problem!  tl;dr? bed has to be physically leveled to far better than 0.5mm in order to automatic leveling to work.

it became clear that my bed was out-of-level enough physically that the auto-leveling was just plain messing up - it was off by more than 0.5mm.  to fix this on the taz 6, i had to come up with some trick to level the bed physically.  i made a very simple one-layer model of soft corner mounts, so i could place them under the pads but above the aluminum bed - thereby raising the heated plate and the washer (on the standoff).  

to determine how much to offset each corner, i used the following commands:
code: select allm420 s0		; turn off bed leveling
g28			; level x/y/z
g29 v4		; level bed, with full diagnostics


this would come back with a report something like this:
code: select all...
recv: g29 auto bed leveling
recv: bed x: -9.000 y: -9.000 z: 0.209
recv: bed x: 288.000 y: -9.000 z: 0.174
recv: bed x: 288.000 y: 289.000 z: 0.026
recv: bed x: -9.000 y: 289.000 z: 0.541
...


from the above, you can see i was off by more than 0.5mm (comparing the z values for each corner).  the highest corner in my case was the back left corner at 0.541, so i needed to raise the other corners (since it's much harder to lower a corner).

what i did is design a simple one-layer shim that matched the corner gaskets (that hold the standoff to the washer and the two screws), and printed about 10 of them. i inserted them above the aluminum plate but below the gasket - thereby raising the standard and the heated bed.  after each attempt, i would run the g-code sequence again looking at the z numbers.  as i got close, i took a flat blade and scraped some of the shims to get back a tad of space.

once i did this, i got all corners physically within 0.07mm!  
code: select all...
recv: g29 auto bed leveling
recv: bed x: -9.000 y: -9.000 z: 0.484
recv: bed x: 288.000 y: -9.000 z: 0.473
recv: bed x: 288.000 y: 289.000 z: 0.459
recv: bed x: -9.000 y: 289.000 z: 0.523
...


now when i run automatic leveling - looking at the z distance at each washer (and using the m119 command to verify z_probe accuracy down to 0.01mm) - i am now level at all four corners within 0.01mm!

i'm going to run a series of print tests, but it sure feels like i've at least nailed the basic leveling problem.

big shout-out to b-morgan for helping!  his pointing out the usage of m119 with g29 v4, and running a test to show his printer had similar (but far less) alignment issues helped big time to figure this out.  and ... @b-morgan ... consider adding a .2 shim to your back left washer!  that should nail your alignment...

chris


my gawd! thank you! i tried everything up until i found you post. come to find out my deviation was .7mm. the shim idea worked beautifully and i was able to physically level my build plate up to a .08mm deviation between the washers. i do have one question however, how do i take this down to .01mm as you did using the m119 command. could you please elaborate on this?

"[dual extruder v3] filament stops feeding, ruins print, can't get out easily","i have recently installed and started using the dual extruder with my taz 6 and i have been having many issues with it. the only time i have been able to get a successful print was with the sample filament and support filament that was given with the shipment. the filament that i have is polylite pla and is the same dimensions as the sample filament given. in the beginning of my print today (no support filament, just using one extruder), everything seemed to run correctly, but after laying down multiple layers, it seems that the filament will stop feeding. after this, the print is ruined. i am not sure what i am supposed to do about this issue because after this occurs i cannot get the filament out easily despite heating the nozzle. it seems like i have to open up the extruder and get it out that way. i am cutting the filament the same way that the dual extruder v3 installation guide suggests, but this issue persists. has anyone had a similar issue with this? if so, how did you solve it? this is getting to be a pain.","i can confirm that the 1.5 to 2 hour mark is about the time my pla prints would fail on the dual extruder v3.  i doubt turning up your speed from 40mm/s will make any real difference, i use the default profile's speed setting of 60mm/s and still experience failures around the same time you do.  both extruder's share the same heat sink (a poor design imo) so what you should do is try making a dummy profile for the other extruder you're not using.  i know there's a no material profile but.... i'm not quite sure what that profile does cause the printing temperature is set to 240c.  though i guess that doesn't really matter cause the unused extruder associated with that profile should be in standby which is 150c.  but why heat it up to 150c (302f) if you don't have too!  especially when cooling is a problem!?

turn on your printer and look at the lcd panel and see what the temperature is at.  set it to that or maybe 5c higher cause if you set it too low it will never cool down to reach your target temperature, plus it will heat up to the target temperature quickly; especially if it only has to go up only 5c or less.  it is possible to make a profile with 0 degrees but i don't recommend it, it will take 2 or 3 minutes to timeout and move on.

know that some settings on one extruder will affect the value on the other extruder.  extruder1 + extruder2 / 2.  for example, the build plate temperature is a value shared between extruders; a change on one side will affect the value on the other side.  layer height is also a good example.  so be sure to make your dummy profile with the same value of the filament you'll be printing with for the settings that are shared.

in quick summary in the dummy profile i would set all the printing temperatures to about 30c including the standby temperature.  here's a good link that explains what those temperature settings mean.  https://ultimaker.com/en/resources/52837-material

i get successful pla prints on the v3 dual extruder with a better quality pla such as that from hatchbox.  some plas are just too soft (mostly no name brand) and absolutely nothing can make those work on the v3 dual extruder, and i've tried many things to improve the cooling to no avail."
power supply for taz 4,my power supply died and need a new one. what’s the best option for a power supply and which one?,what does the current power supply look like?
taz pro,"have a taz pro that i am trying to use with simplify3d.
i need to enter the extruder offset to get accurate profile set up in s3d.
that information was available for the dual extruder tool head on my taz 6 but i cannot find it anywhere.
does anyone have this info or know where i can get it?","when i wanted to use s3d with my taz 6 dual extruder v3 i had to add it as a custom printer. this involved creating a profile including (modified) start code and end code.

for the taz 6, curale generates g-code that has the offset for the second nozzle (or the offsets for both nozzles) handled within curale. s3d (by default) leaves the offset(s) to be handled by the firmware (using the m218 command to set them).

in order to print parts sliced by either slicer in any order, i added an m218 t1 x0 y0 command to the curale start code and then put an m218 t1 x13 y0 command into my modified s3d start code.

i'm not sure how the taz pro nozzle offset(s) (and the raise and lower part) are handled in curale but if it is in the slicer like it is for the taz 6, then the printer definition should include the offset(s) you need. if, on the other hand, the firmware is in charge, then take a look at the .config file for the version of firmware in the taz pro at http://devel.lulzbot.com/software/marlin/. 

i think this is the answer:
code: select all#define hotend_offset_x {0.0, 43}
#define hotend_offset_y {0.0, 0}"
taz 6 bed leveling problems,"hi, all

i don't what is happening with my 3d printer. i made sure several times that is perfectly balanced in the z axis, but when it is printing, only on the right frontal corner is doing it correctly, when it goes to the opposite side, the filament barely touches the bed. when the printing continues, in that side the filament eventually does not reach the bed and gets stuck in the tip. i've tried several times now and the last time the printing stopped automatically indicating a bed leveling problem. do you know if there is any way to do a calibration of the bed leveling please? you would help me a lot, thanks.",the taz 6 auto-levels before each print.  is that procedure working properly?  have you switched slicers or are you trying to print a gcode file?  the only other thing i can think of is to check that the printer is on a level and stable table.
[solved] hot end not holding temp for certain filaments,"problem: hot end works great with most filaments but with at least two specific filaments it holds the target temp (210) for the first layer or two then drops to 180-190 for the rest of the print.

solution: tuned fan speed down to 30-60% rather than 100%

background: i've had my taz6 for a couple years now and use it routinely for producing large numbers of small objects (basically prop coins) that i then sell.  i use 7 or 8 different colors of filament [all pla, most from the same supplier, stored in the same way] to make the different types of coins.  a few months ago i switched from the stock printhead to an aerostruder and at the same time i switched from cura 21.04 to cura-lulzbot 3.6.13.  

for a month or two everything worked great.  then i noticed prints using the white silk (filaments.ca ecotough brand) filament were jamming a few layers in and after watching the prints i realized that after the first layer or two the temp was dropping from the programmed 205 to 180-190.  that was leading to the filament grinding which lead to the jam.  when i couldn't resolve the issue at the time i figured it must just be something with that particular species of filament (changing the spool hasn't affected the issue).  every other color of filament was printing normally until a few days when a second color of filament (ziro twinkling red) started causing the same issue.

notes:
* i've double checked the gcode on each model and can't find any errors
* any model/gcode i print with another filament works fine, but any model/gcode printed with one of these two filaments can't hold the temp
* i already checked my extruder's serial code against the service bulletin for aerostruder printheads in feb2018
* without a print job the print head has no problem reaching and holding it's max temp (290)
* since i only use pla my temperature parameters don't change much from job to job, typically 205 or 215 for the extruder and 60 for the head bed
* adjusting the temp in the gcode or manually during a print has no effect on the actual temp

this all seems to suggest some gremlin in the hardware or firmware somewhere but i can't understand why would be specific to a particular species of filament in that case.  i might be able to replace these particular colors with some other brand but if the problem spreads to other filaments that becomes more and more problematic.","orias wrote: ?wed aug 28, 2019 11:48 am
re: * any model/gcode i print with another filament works fine, but any model/gcode printed with one of these two filaments can't hold the temp
is that with the same slicing profiles between the various filaments?

correct.
orias wrote: ?wed aug 28, 2019 11:48 am
your print cooling fan is running at 100% in that image. load the same print and the same print profile, switch to custom, and in the cooling section, set the fan speed maximum to 66% and the min to ~20% if the min is above 50%. try the print again and see how that change affects the target vs actual temperature.
i'm still waiting for a full set to finish but these settings allowed me to print a few test coins with the relevant filaments and it looks like that's resolved the issue.  thanks!"
problems with the taz6,"hi, all

in my laboratory we have the taz6 model and it has been failing for a while now. after the 30-40 layer, the filament stops coming out although the pattern keeps moving like if it was printing. we are not exactly sure what is happening with the printer, maybe it has to do with the heat that is not melting enough filament?

thanks for your time.","if you are working with a temperature sensitive filament like pla then you could be running into some heat creep if your lab is particularly warm. heat creep is when the filament gets warm past the hot end and becomes malleable and then the hobbed bolt chews through it like butter and can lead to extrusion issues. 

to remedy heat creep you can try lowering the printing temperature (for pla i would try 190c-200c) or using a small desk fan to point towards the print while it prints. if you are using an enclosure i would also recommend opening the doors of the enclosure or otherwise venting it for proper part cooling."
additional heating resistors in taz4 and taz5,"hello,

my name is harsha and i have taz4 and taz5 at the lab where i work. since, i wanted more heat, i was thinking of adding an additional heater resistor near the nozzle, so as to keep the filament more warm and liquidy. i wanted to ask how this was gonna affect the printer? will the software support this change? or will i have to change the entire setup altogether?

please, do get back to me about this. your help will be much appreciated.

best regards,
harsha bharadwaj","i just have a few questions...
why do you believe you need more heat (i.e. what are the symptoms of the problem)? 
what type of filament are you printing with? 
how fast are you trying to print? 
what software are you slicing with? 
how are you sending the gcode to the printer?

unless the heating elements you have are ""worn out"", the symptoms you are experiencing can probably be solved with adjustments to your slicing parameters."
auto-leveling presses down bed corners,"sorry if this has been answered already, i wasn't having any luck with searches.

we have a taz 6, completely stock with a single extruder head.  it has been working great for the past few years but recently problems with the prints have been showing up.  i'm going to start with the auto-leveling issue because that will likely solve many other problems...

when a print begins and the head goes around touching the metal pads on the corners, the bed is physically pushed down on three of the four, with the worst being pushed down around 2-3mm.  i'm not sure exactly how the sensor works but making the assumption that there is some voltage passed between the metal surfaces i tried wiping down the nozzle while it was hot to make sure there was no excess filament.  while i have seen the abl process fail due to a dirty head (touching the first pad then going back and wiping the nozzle again), it is not doing that now.  since the nozzle pushes the bed down quite a bit i'm pretty sure something in the bed leveling process is failing -- how would i troubleshoot this?

my own experience is with manually leveled beds on other printers, so i tried a 5-point leveling test print to see where i'm at.  the results made it clear the nozzle is too close to the bed, even scraping up the filament on the corner that gets pushed down the worst.  i attempted to adjust the z-offset with m851.  the original value was at 1.20, and it looked a little better as i reduced the value, but by 0.90 the filament wouldn't stick to the bed (not surprising).  even at 1.00 the surface of the test print was very rough as the nozzle offset previous strands of filament, but results were a bit better.  obviously since i'm still not getting a smooth top surface my attempts to change the z offset did not help the problem, so i'll revert the value back to 1.20 and try correcting the auto-leveling process instead.

any help is appreciated.","yes, the autolevelling is done with a voltage between the washer and the nozzle.

usually, any visible depression of the corner means that there was some sort of plastic residue or such that had to be compressed or pushed out of the way before sufficient force could cause the washer and nozzle to touch -- cleaning both the nozzle and the washer is the normal cure for that.  do not use a wire brush (you will short out the control board, which is an expensive repair).  use a scotch-brite (non-metallic) pad.  check both the nozzle and the washers.

it's also worth checking that your washers are snugly screwed down (don't screw too tight, you'll strip the aluminum threads!).  they should be just tight enough that they are level (not tilted up on one side), and should no longer rotate when you try to turn them by hand.

if all that is good, then there's a possibility that you've a wiring problem.  check the bed wiring (and connectors) to see if the constant motion of the bed has caused a loose connection or a wire failure due to wire fatigue (the latter seems more common on the mini, though).  same thing on the tool-head connector and wiring."
taz 6 z probe: i need some bed leveling help,"i have replaced my tool head with a new hs 0.8, after using the hs+ for a couple of prints and am noticing that the hs head can't print pla. basically, if i *can* get the z probe to not fail, the print pulls off the bed. i decided that it might be a bed leveling issue, so i ran the m29 command to test...

taz 6 probing problem,"i'm stumped, maybe someone can help point me the right direction.  

for whatever reason the g29 probing sequence has started failing on the second touch point. it initially descends, touches the pad, moves up slightly and when i expect it to descend again to fine tune the z value it doesnt.  it fails and returns to the wiper pad. 

here is what i know...
cura versions tested: 3.2.27, 3.6.13, 3.6.18 (caches cleared between installations)  it used to work fine with 2.3.27 but not anymore.

firmware versions tested: 1.1.9.34  and 1.1.9.16 (unfortunately i am not sure what version firmware used to work.  probably whatever was shipping when version 2.3.27 of cura was shipping)

 - its not a dirty print head.  i have cleaned and cleaned the print head.  the first touch point works flawlessly.  the first stage of the second touch point works flawlessly.  contact is being made and recognized on the second touch point as there is zero plate deflection.

- its not an electrical problem with the second touch pad.  i have measured the resistance between all the touch pads and they read 0.3 ohms between each and every one of them.  electrically all the pads are connected through the bed plate.

- i really doubt its the start gcode.  everything works great prior to the g29 command.  it is during this firmware driven process that it fails.  never the less, i have used the stock start gcode and some modified gcode that i found in various other posts on this forum.  none of it really applied to my case, but i tried it anyway

- its not my print host flaking out.  i get exactly the same behavior with cure le, octoprint, prusaslicer and just gcode commands sent via console.

like i said, i am stumped.  anyone have any ideas?  i thought about rolling back to an old firmware version but i wasnt able to find an archive on the lulzbot site.  would i get this from the marlin firmware github site?  or is lulzbot firmware customized?

thanks,  ian",your x axis might be out of level. position the nozzle tip so it is just above the front lh washer. turn off the printer and slowly move the toolhead over to the front lh washer. adjust the leadscrews manually until the nozzle is the same distance above the washer as the rh side. go back to the rh side and verify it didn't change while you adjusted the lh leadscrew.

voltage and current measurement - taz 4,"hello, 

my name is harsha and i have taz4 at the lab where i work. i wanted to measure the corresponding voltage and current values for different temperatures. however, i am not able to do so.

i tried placing a breadboard in between the wires of thermistor and heating resistor that go from the printer to the thermistor and heating resistor. 

this way the circuit is very much in place and i should be able to measure the voltage by placing an additional wire in the breadboard, using a multimeter.

however, i am not able to get the accurate values of voltages, as it fluctuates a lot. 

could someone suggest an alternate way of measurement of currents and voltages or anyway i can modify the current circuit?

your help is much appreciated. please, do get back to me about this.","the thermistor resistance varies as the temperature changes. the only voltage and current involved is the circuit to measure the resistance.

i believe the heating resistor is turned on and off by the firmware to maintain a temperature. again the voltage and current are not varied, only the ratio of on to off time.

instead of asking us for a solution to an unknown problem, describe the problem you are trying to solve and we can suggest a solution.

i have an ac power monitor that displays the voltage and current (or watts) being drawn by the printer power supply. i could just use the control panel of the printer to set various nozzle temperatures and measure the wattage needed to maintain that temperature. additional variables are, of course, the ambient air temperature and the air circulation around the nozzle."
nozzle is missing wiper pad and hitting mount,"on my taz6, during the bed-leveling procedure, the nozzle is coming down too far to the right and is just rubbing the nozzle on the plastic mount of the wiper pad. during the process, it manages to wipe on the wiper pad enough to pass the bed-leveling test, but my wiper mount is getting melted by the nozzle. i would have to guess this is some sort of x misalignment, but i don't know where to start.
i've attached a video of the problem as well.
thanks.
","i'd check the x min stop to see if it is loose or has moved. the wiper pad start g-code moves between x=-15, x=-17, y=100, and y=23.

first check where zero is by using the lcd ""movement, auto home"" or sending a g28 to the printer (you can do this without heating the nozzle). the lcd should display x:-19.00 y:258.00 z:10.00 or you can send m114 to the printer. the nozzle should be centered over the z min stop switch. might also be good to check the stop switches with an m119.

you can manually move the nozzle with the lcd to x=-15, y=100 (or use g1 x-15 y100) and the nozzle should be over the wiper pad. with the lcd, step x one mm at a time and observe that the nozzle moves. if something interferes with the movement, this can alter the printer firmware's sense of zero versus the actual nozzle's sense of zero."

is it an optical sensor that doesnt like white? how do i adjust the run-out sensor or disable it from stopping my prints?


the runout and strip out detector is a rotary encoder that is tied to marlin. essentially when the extruder is supposed to be laying down filament, the sensor checks for movement on the encoder. there are a few items you can check and settings to adjust if need be.

1.) ensure the filament is loaded into the correct sensor. the green sensor is for extruder one (left extruder) and the black sensor is for extruder two (right extruder.) if you route these improperly, the wrong sensor will be moving and it will throw this error.

2.) ensure that the filament guide tubes are secure in both the sensor and the tool head. if these are not secured slack can be developed when moving the tool head, preventing a trigger from the sensor.

3.) you can check the tension on the runout/strip out detector. you can tighten the two screws (one for each sensor) using the included 2mm hex driver. if you over tighten, you will create extra drag and cause actual strip outs. (if you find it very difficult to load filament through the sensor, you have over tightened it)

4.) you can adjust your runout/strip out distance via the lcd. this essentially increases/decreases how long the extruder needs to output filament before registering feedback from the sensor. (menu > advanced settings > filament > runout sensor > adjust detection threshold)

5.) you can disable the filament runout feature via the lcd. this is recommended for 1.75mm filament (for those who would like to try it) and for ninjaflex. (the compression can cause inconsistency with the sensor) (menu > advanced settings > filament > runout sensor > off)

we hope this helps!"

sorry about the picture it wont rotate the proper way up","i’m assuming the spool just sits on that triangular shaped structure, if so, why can’t you just lift it up and turn the entire spool left or right and rotate the filament back on the roll until it lines up correctly like thread on a spool?  it looks to me as if you had the spool on the lulzbot provided spool holder that’s on the side and you just lifted it onto that other spool holder while the filament was already fed into the print head.  that or you loaded the filament onto the aerostruder tool head with the filament in line with you and the tool head (facing the front of the taz) and then you lifted the spool onto that spool holder on top.  thus inducing the “twist”.

when loading the filament raise the toolhead between 150 & 200 on the z-axis, this way you’ll have less twisting force to wrestle with."
taz 6 + brand new moarstruder makes loud popping sound,"i have had the moarstruder since last monday. it started off just fine but as the week progressed it developed a popping sound that got louder and more frequent. i can't seem to locate the source but it may either be the gears or the idler.

what ever part it is it's so loud now that it can be heard through walls. very annoying!

i do not see anything in the print that would suggest that it is adding any artifacts.

any help would be great!

thanks!

simple trick for leveling bed,"the only thing i hate about 3d printing is the obsessive compulsive nature required for leveling the print bed.  as a woodworker i use jigs for everything and today it occurred to me to use one for the x-axis.  use a short piece of wood say 64 mm (about 2 inches) long to level the axis on both sides.  now without having to determine whether or not your eyes are failing because you live in a state that condones marijuana use   you simply have to place the bottom of the wood piece on the aluminum part of your build tray, then turn down the drive rods until the 500 mm smooth rods of the x-axis touch the wood firmly without pushing down the aluminum plate below.

do you remember 7th grade when the science assignment was to measure something with a yard stick and no one had the same measurement?  this should take out the guess work.  i realized this when i was printing 20 mm blocks.  i am at an age where my vision is a bit slow but if i simply cut a 20 mm or so block and place it under the nozzle, i can adjust the build plate up or down as required.  i can do it on both the two rear corners and the two front corners.  viola!

i have found that the thickness of business cards can vary from 0.27mm to 0.33 mm  so  unless you keep the same business card it will be difficult to achieve the same distance between the build plate and the nozzle.  a feeler guage works very well but judging how tight the nozzle is pressing down on the build plate can be somewhat non specific.  using a block of a specified thickness which you know and lowering the nozzle to the block from either the lcd screen or the slicer 1mm at a time should give the perfect space from the build plate when the block is removed and the machine is homed-all.  it should be an easy peasy to adjust your pei sheet up or down as needed at the corners of the build plate and a level x-axis.

if someone wants to tell me that my idea is stupid i will take the criticism.  being wrong is a great way to learn.  on the other hand i would like to cut down the time it takes to level my bed.  don't we all have better things to do?","any idea to help with leveling the bed is worth consideration.  

using the aluminum plate is a good idea.  its a better reference than the table which the printer is resting on... since the y-rails sit on printed parts with heat inserts (which could vary).  using the lcd (i use octoprint, and don't use the lcd much) to finalize the leveling is where i lose you... i guess if you're using the lcd to get the initial left hand corner (home position) height, then the right-hand lead screw to match the height of the wooden block... that would work.  well, as long as the block doesn't deflect or material doesn't compress.  

my process is to finalize leveling the bed:
-  to get the initial nozzle height start point, i start with feelers or a business card... specifically my business card (which i know i need a few turns on the z-endstop).  
-  then (digital) dial-gauges on either side of the toolhead to ensure the print bed is level.    
-  to finalize the nozzle height, i print a set of calibration print to check for extrusion width consistency and ""squash"".  
     - the first calibration print is a pattern of concentric circles to check for a consistent extrusion width.  
     - the second is a 10x10x5mm square to look at the bottom and judge how i like the squash - the gap between extrusions.  and evaluate top and bottom dimensions for deformations (elephants foot).

i usually stop there (the prints i make don't require that much precision, and some point ).  but to get more precise, i've used the z-offset g-code setting in my slicer (s3d).  then translate the offset value into # of turns or partial turns of the z-endstop screw pitch (taz 5).  i think its a m5 with a pitch of .8mm, which means half a turn is .4mm and quarter turn is .2mm... etc.  markings on the adjustment screw helps... i have a multi-colored thumbcap.



sounds like you're on the right track with the jigs!"
hs tool head 0.8 made a expensive mistake,"hi all

i purchased the hs tool head 0.8 thinking stupidly it was based on the aeroe head but with hardened drives act,, i find it has a volcano fitted which is not what i wanted to achieve i want to print with carbon but want to print fairly small parts with a .4 nozzle, which you cant buy in volcano nozzles,, question is it possible to remove the volcano and replace it for v6 parts, this will leave me with two problems the nozzle will be further away from the bed and the fan shroud would need replacing, would the esteps then be out of sync... any help and suggestion greatly received...","it’s just as easy to get out as the standard nozzle just more threads.  use the same method, heat it up, shut the printer off, hold the heater block from twisting with a wrench or pliers, unscrew nozzle.  yes mine is working good, in fact, i think i like the volcanoes are better because of the longer melt zone.  good luck with your project.

[dual extruder v3] printing different colors for different layers,"i am attempting to use the dual extruder to print a file that will print from layer 0 to 11 as extruder 1 and layers 11 to 22 as extruder 2. i have done a color change by using ""modify g-code"" on my single extruder, but i am not sure how to approach this with the dual extruder since i should not need to swap any filament out for this and it would only need to start using the second extruder halfway through the print. i looked up information prior to this about this, but i was not able to find much assistance. any help is appreciated.","with dual extrusion, you'll need the object broken into two stls according to the color.  then join them in a slicer software to assign the extruders and create a single gcode file.

a two color cylinder (top and bottom) is simple example.  the lower half would be a stl assigned to the t0 extruder.  the top half would be a second stl assigned to print with the t1 extruder.  the only problem with this type of print would be the non-printing hot-end staying hot and carbonizing the filament or creating ooze... if the slicer doesn't automatically turn down the temp on the non-printing hotend, do it manually.


the dual extrusion octopus as a good first multi-color print.  actually,  the best ""first"" object would be a  dual extrusion calibration object."
any interested in manufacturing parts?,"i am preparing a product for kickstarter in the fall. you can view a picture of an older prototype here: https://roboppics.com 

if people subscribe on kickstarter, i might need to print and assemble 10 - 50 of these in response to the kickstarter campaign.

it is 90% 3d printed on a taz 6 using polymax - which is a little hard to print and does require thicker pei on the build plate plus an enclosure.

i am just wondering if there are taz 6 owners who might be interested in making parts? 

i send you the g-code, you make the parts on your taz, you send me the parts and make a little money and maybe learn a bit... real distributed manufacturing 

anyone interested enough to talk about it?

thanks,

michael","hi joe,

pei or polyetherimide is the thin plastic film stuck to the build plate of a lulzbot.

it has some great properties for sticking to and holding the printed model, and yet is able to be easily separated from the completed print.

the strength of a polycarbonate filament, particularly with larger prints, the 3mil pei film that is standard on a lulzbot can be lifted right off the bed as the plastic cures. one solution is a thicker pei such as 1/16th of an inch thick. another solution, or so i have heard, is an aluminum build plate. i have not tried that.

to get consistent prints, you need to control the environment. this includes humidity (below 15% for many filaments) and temperature. i use a room dehumidifier to hold the humidity at 30%, which seems to work fine for pc-max.  i find that when printing pc-max, the temp inside the enclosure without a heater runs close to 100f since the bed is heated to 100c. this makes a big difference in print quality over room temperature without an enclosure. 

with a heated enclosure, you can run the temp up to 50c (122f), but lulzbot says above that and you risk serious damage to the printer (although there are some strategies for getting around that by also adding cooling for key components). 

the reason that no one including lulzbot sells a heated enclosure, is that stratasys owns the patent on it. which means you pretty much have to build one yourself.

lulzbot taz 6: different nozzles,"i want to try and print abrasive material (carbon fiber, glow in the dark) but is my only option getting getting an adapter and a hs tool head? can i instead just swap out the brass nozzle with either a ruby, a tungsten carbide nozzle, or a hardened steel nozzle?
i am not planning on printing a lot of abrasive material so it doesn't seem worth it to shell out $600 on the specialized tool head.
i also had the same question about trying to print with a smaller nozzle diameter for more fine details.
i know that this would violate warranty but i was hoping for some information. i currently am running a lulzbot taz 6 with the standard single extruder","the ruby nozzle won’t work on the taz 6 because the auto leveling feature is sensed through the nozzle via capacitance i think.  never put anything conductive on the nozzle (i.e. wire brush, water, wrench) on the nozzle while the printer is on else you’ll probably blow the micro fuse and have to deal with having to replace that.

when i swap out my nozzle i’ll run the print head up to 200 to 250mm on the z, heat up the nozzle to 260c then turn off the printer.  with a crescent wrench i’ll hold on to the heater block and use a 7mm wrench on the nozzle.  like b-hep-spring said, the original nozzle has two flat sides and curves between the flats, meaning you can’t use a box wrench or a socket, you’ll have to use an open end wrench.  there’ll be a good chance the new nozzle will be six side and you can use a socket, sooooo much easier then.  just do the reverse steps with the new nozzle, put it in cold(whatever the current temp is from your removal). then heat up the head to 260c, turn the printer off, hold the heater block with a crescent wrench or channel lock pliers, give it a little tightening twist for snugness.  be careful to not over tighten as you can break the nozzle.  be sure to get the appropriate size nozzle.  i can tell you the dual v3 uses a “volcano” type nozzle and the standard print head and aerustruder print head use the standard length nozzle.  all m6 type threads.

i don’t think it’d really be a problem running special filament through a few times with the stock equipment.  you’re aware those filaments have abrasive additives and that will wear down softer metals faster than the parts made for that made with harder metals.  swapping out the nozzle is easy and fairly cheap.  i seen a post on here not too long ago pointing someone where to get a hardened steel hobbed bolt.  those would be the two essential parts that handle the abrasive filament."
taz pro - esteps per extruder - how to set?,"is there a way to adjust the esteps per extruder on the taz pro?  in the control panel on the printer i only see esteps in general which i take to mean it adjusts for both extruders at the same time?  it seems i need extruder 2 to output more filament, but extruder 1 is ok.  i know i could probably increase the flow rate in cura for that extruder, but i'd rather just have it set right from the get-go.  thank  you for any help. ","the two extruders should have the same esteps. the gearing's going to be the same across all of them. if one of the extruders isn't extruding the way you'd like, start by looking at the tension on that extruder thumbscrew. the captured nut should be visible and almost in the middle, give or take a bit. what filament are you using? how's the first layer or three? send in pictures and this information through https://lulzbot.com/support and they'll be able to offer detailed help."
taz 5 grinding filament,"hi all,

in advance, thank you anyone for your help. i am working with a taz 5 single extruder for my company and have been having issues with repeated filament grinding where the motored gear feeds the filament. i've included pictures of the taz 5 unit, the extruder body, the filament after issue occurs, the cura ""lulzbot edition"" settings, and the part we are attempting to print. during trial and error, i noticed that the bearing (used to apply pressure to the filament so that the gear can feed the filament) does not move. online i read that if the filament in the feeding section becomes too hot than it is likely cause an issue similar to what i am having. i mention this because i think that friction from the idle bearing may be causing the filament to heat up to this temperature. this seems a bit extreme to me so i'd like any advice i can get. 

yes, the nozzle stays at a roughly uniform temperature during the entire process.

thank you all","your idler arm could be either too loose or too tight. loosen it until there is just a little pressure pushing against the filament and clear out any existing plastic chips in the hobbed bolt, this is more likely a scenario than heat creep in my opinion. it could also be ground up plastic in the hobbed bolt causing less grip

also do yourself a favor and print up the updated beefy idler assembly and while you're disassembling the old one check to see if the bearing is still good and clean it all out.
http://download.lulzbot.com/mini/1.04/p ... ler_latch/

if these taz 5's have been in service a while then it's a good idea to make all new printed parts for the extruder assembly. i did this on mine i've had since 2015 as well as the strengthened extruder assembly on thingiverse and have been getting much better and more consistent results printing as of late"
[dual extruder v3] disassembly of extruders from heat break,"i have posted about this before, but there is filament that is stuck in the heat break of my e1 extruder. i have disassembled it, but i want to know what the safest way of getting the extruders off will be? i have pictures of my issue and would appreciate any help. i just don't want to mess something up with this and hurt the printer head.","at this point you could probably separate the heat break from the heatsink by unscrewing those very tiny allen head screws, use the smallest allen wrench from the kit that came with your taz 6.  once separated you can use a heat gun or flame to melt off the plastic."

taz 6 cuts out when heating up,"hi,

been printing for over 12mths now and haven't turned the unit off for more than 2 weeks total in this time.
i have converted it to run 1.75mm filament with new hot end tube and printed parts also.
been working hassle free for ages but now it will only heat to around 170° to 200° then cuts out to a reboot screen.

any help would be appreciated.","ok so self fixed the issue,

vibration in y axis even after bed swap,"i have two taz 6 printers and one started having loud y travel. there was some kind of vibration going on, i could see the y belt vibrate when it moved. i tried readjusting the bed, adding some lubricant. i even tried replacing the motor with a spare i had. 

in tried moving the printer to the floor incase it was the bench but no change.

then i went for broke and did a bed swap between my two printers the other one worked fine. i easily swapped the two beds and guess what, the vibration was still there with a totally different bed! 

what the hell is going on?","i had what sounds like the same issue in my y axis. loud noisy vibration. i also was having layer shifting. i replaced belts and bearings to no avail. with the help from lulzbot support and swapping axis motor driver harnesses, it was proven to be a bad y axis driver on the rambo board. had to replace the board."
taz pro experiences,"i am interested to hear of others experiences with the new taz pro?  i have done a lot of googling and cannot find /any/ actual reviews of the taz pro (just spec recaps), which i find perplexing given the printer has been released for almost a month now.

i am looking forward to hopefully gaining insight from the community - from the marketing it looks to be a great printer ... what is the reality?

thank you,
bruce","have had mine a couple of days and so far so good. first of all, the printer, documentation, parts etc are all quite beautiful. the color lcd touch screen is an excellent addition.

i have only run a couple of prints through so far. the dual color calibration test print is very impressive and am now working my way through some prints of my own that require pva support as i could never get that to work with the taz 6 and a dual extruder head. i have one successful print of one attempt so am at 100% so far. just working with default settings at the moment to remove any variables. test continue today...

summary: so far so good but we are 36 hours in. 

the reason i purchased this now as opposed to waiting for reviews even though it is very new and untested is my previous experiences with lulzbot support. i have a mini that i upgraded to a mini 2 and my wife has a couple of minis at school - all are workhorses and lulzbot support are always responsive and helpful. i figured i'd take the plunge as they'll help me out no matter what.

the noise produced by a 3d printer is usually louder than a laser printer but not as loud as a paper shredder. you don't need ear protection but if it was sitting next to your tv in the living room, anyone watching tv would either complain or turn the volume up to a higher than normal setting. i don't think the printer would require vibration dampening.

taz 6 bed leveling fail.,"taz 6.  

it's about a month old. bed leveling process starts normally. it does the ""double touch"" on the first two (front) washers.  goes to the third washer. the head starts down but it does not touch, maybe 4 mm (?) from touching the washer and then goes straight over to do a rewipe.

at first i assumed it was a dirty head but i got it nice and shiny clean and changed the wiper pad. still no joy so then i lightly buffed the washer up with 220 sand paper and made it nice and shiny then cleaned with ipa. 

only then did i realize it the print head does not make it down the washer. it is not failing to 'sense' contact it simply is not making contact.  

youtube vid.  the vid starts on washer 2. you can see the double tap. i get a little out of frame getting out of the way of the moving bed but at the 19 second mark pause it then go frame by frame... it never touches washer 3...it does not even come close!

i had a abs print not stick to the bed and i was just printing a solid ball.  so from the lcd i aborted the print then again from the lcd i did a 'move axis' to lift the print head up high enough to clean up all the balled up filament.  well i spun the knob too enthusiastically and the z bar went all the up to the top and hit the frame. there is a limit switch on top of the z bar so i was not worried but i did heard a couple of clicks before it stopped moving! 

then i got engrossed in cleaning up the gob of filament and naturally when the print head went to re-wipe i assumed i had not cleaned well enough.  in short, enough time passed that i forgot about the “clicking noise” i heard when the z bar went all the way to the stop. 

since the front two washers leveled fine but the back one would not i thought i had problem with the y axis. only with david’s answer did i go, “aha! the clicking noise!” (on the z axis) 

so when i did re-level the z bar i did it with bar all the way up and the limit switch engaged. hopefully, if i get to exuberant with the knob again that will prevent a recurrence of the problem.

bored yet?  i generally only put dates to sleep but  if i helped you sleep without having to feed you too that is a bonus! "
taz pro build log,"i'm currently in the process of building a taz pro and thought i'd share some pics.  i have all the parts needed to build one except i still need to print the printed parts.  the z axis motors and shafts will be arriving this week.  i machined all the metal parts now i need to powder coat the ones that are.  my friend is laser cutting the electronics enclosure for me and i will bend it.  i received the filament sensor,  dual extruder, usb and clcd pcb boards from oshpark.  i'm gonna solder them with my reflow oven.","neat!!!

let me know if you have any interest in selling a set of the y and top frame plates, possibly 3 of the frame corners if you are cutting them? i'm going a different route on the motion bits and the extruder setup. i will be adding the filliment sensors for sure though."
e1:err: mintemp taz6 dual head v2,"hello. i received an used taz 6 and since the beginning it showed errors as power lost and that there is a new firmware when i tried to print. when i tried to print it said printing and then after 3 minutes around it came the power lost error. never reached the first extruder the 23% in the lcd display with a fan icon. then it resets. i could never print. then because i that, i updated the firmware automatically from the software cure and after that in the display of the taz 6 i see this error: 
code: select alle1:err: mintemp

and the reset text. now is impossible to access because is stuck in the error. the printer has installed a dual extruder head v2. what could be the problem?",e1 err min temp is a thermistor error on the left-hand side extruder (e1). it suggests that something along that wiring path has an intermittent break. reach out to the support team at https://lulzbot.com/support and they'll be able to help you determine where the break is. if you have access to a multi-meter it'll help make diagnosis and confirmation quick.
taz pro calibration cube,any possibility that we could get this as a taz 6 upgrade mod? does it require a belt driven z-axis?,"i could see this being something several manufacturers/modders implement since tmc drivers can detect collision, no need to have lulzbot's unique take. it's just a matter of time and effort vs gain. i have no doubt lulzbot is using the nozzle just like they are with leveling so this could probably be ported with relative ease. however cause i bet it's using this system i expect this feature to cause a ton of issues just like the leveling does already."
don't skimp on wiring! / taz 5 + duet + rebuild,"my taz has been good to me for the past 3-4 years.  however, i randomly discovered that the bed connector was a bit charred and that could have made for a bad day.  i wanted to give the printer an overhaul, which included replacing the rambo with a duet.  i had a lapse in judgement when i decided to extend the bed wiring with 16awg.  started to smell after i fired up the printer but at least it didn't quite smoke.  ended up bypassing the amp connector and ran powerpole connectors straight to the duet and crimping a new pigtail for the sensor.","couple pics of the new parts i'm printing out.  having pretty good success with esun epa+cf. glass bed + kapton + elmer's xtreme glue stick.

debating if i want to try printing the extruder in acetal.  perhaps its ""slipperiness"" would help the filament go in and slide easier?"
lulzbot support is horrible,"tell you what, i have never run across a worse company in terms of support than lulzbot. if you are considering buying any product from lulzbot, i would suggest you read through this first:

i purchased back on march 15, 2019 a top of the line combination package for the lulzbot taz 6 + hs 0.8mm + sl 0.25mm tool heads and heated enclosure, and still to this day i have yet to use either of the additional tool heads.

for starters, i just dropped close to $5k for a turn key printer that is supposed to print out of the box without a bunch of assembly and configuration. nonsense, how about you spend 4 hours assembling about 400 pieces of cheap acrylic into the heated build chamber, and with everything affixed together with about 200 m4 nuts. miserable.

turn on the printer, the display is defective. no possible way they tested this setup unless they managed to somehow not look at the display when printing the test octopus. support ticket, i need to send them back the lcd for evaluation, they will ship a replacement. i am super not happy, why am i being penalized for your faulty printer that was not tested prior to shipping? they then agree to ship me a replacement lcd, which after removal of 14 bolts i then have to remove the original lcd then re-install the replacement. replacement has a stuck button defect, but i'm not about to pull everything apart again and go through the hassle of another rma.

using the default print head, good results on the first set of prints although everything in cura is not dimensionally accurate for some reason; prints are about 10% off but i don't have time to troubleshoot any of it.

install the sl 0.25mm head, flash firmware, no go. contact support again, they say it's a z-offset issue. i say how in the world can there be a z-offset issue when i purchased a printer with autoleveling bed which is supposed to dynamically calculate the z-offset with each print? tech sends me instructions, none of them are applicable to the taz 6, none of the options he is telling me to pull exist in the lcd menu.

swap out the sl 0.25mm head for the hs 0.8mm head. the default piece of green petg filament is in the extruder, but won't extrude or retract. i let it heat for 10 minutes per support and then use needle nose pliers to try to pull the filament after loosening the bolt, no way this is coming out and it's somehow completely fused inside the extruder. tech sends me troubleshooting instructions for the default tool head, inapplicable to the hs 0.8mm head which has no way of servicing it that i can tell.

oh and let me tell you about lulzbot documentation, it's a real jewel. half of everything is based on pronterface it seems, or they just leave old articles online and don't differentiate between different makes and model printers i guess?

so this is where everything is at now. i get the email from tech support that i must send them pdfs of my proof of purchase receipts - from them (i bought the printer online directly from lulzbot but they don't have my purchase order history accessible?).

and then, they will grant warranty service. so for a $5k printer that has never worked out of the box properly and with two super expensive additional extruders that have never once worked or been used, i have to box everything up and ship it to canada or wherever at my own expense, at which point lulzbot will have their techs evaluate everything and determine if they can be repaired.

ridiculous and absurd, a miserable company to work with and terrible support. i could have built two prusa i3s by now and spent less than half the money.

buyer beware",sorry for your bad experience. i have had just the opposite action with lulzbot support. i was having a severe layer shift in the y axis. it took some back and forth time with support to fully diagnose the issue but they were patient with me and ultimately got to the root of the problem and now i'm back up and squirting plastic. i felt their support did a great job in my case.
taz4 bed not flat?,"hi folks
i'm slowly fixing up a taz4, having finally got it all operational with a new hot end i decided to start looking at calibration.

im noticing that the bed is higher in the middle than it is at the 4 corners. i've tried adjusting all the corners but that only changed the tilt, doesn't change the fact that the z calibration is bang on in the middle but terrible as it gets closer to the corners.

any pointers?","nopick wrote: ?tue mar 26, 2019 10:10 am
the toolhead actually twists the x smooth rods when it is in the center, causing the nozzle to be closer to the bed. the taz 6 corrected this with larger smooth rods.

just get the corners to an acceptable level of squish and live with extra squish in the middle. you can arrive at a happy middle ground that works.

swapping the toolhead for a titan or titan aero unit reduces the problem by reducing toolhead weight.


i've already got an aerostruder on it. are the taz6 rods a direct drop in or is there more to it than that?"
confused by the leveling print bed instructions in manual,"i thought that i had leveled my bed well enough when i first unpacked my printer,  but i think that it needs to be tweaked just a little more.  however in the the manual regarding how to level the bed.  i'm confused about the following:

""to raise or lower the front right corner of the bed adjust the third screw from the left.  do not adjust the middle screw""

i'm not positive about which set of screws i need to adjusting.  i want to take a guess that they are the on each of the four four corners of the print bed.  is this correct.

a picture would be greatly appreciated.

thank you for your time
wazman","yes, leveling the bed can be confusing.  at first it seems like a juggling act but there are some hacks.  i have a taz 5.  can't afford auto-leveling so what i am giving you is really basic.  

one of the first things i did was to put a white mark on the z offset nob.  now when i turn it i know how many turns i have made exactly and there is an equality for the number of turns vs. the offset.  think of it as a jar lid.  counter clockwise raises the lid -and the leveling screws.  clockwise lowers the lid.  the more you turn the z offset nob counterclockwise the higher the extruder head will stop away from the bed.  if the leveling screws are too tight you want to raise them so you will have to raise the x axis by turning the knob in order to give you room to raise the bed under the nozzle. 

here is another hack for leveling the x axis.  i know not everyone has a miter saw (had one handy) but you probably know someone who does.  i cut a 3/8 inch piece of plywood  (had one handy) about 3 inches long and 50.6mm wide.  experiment for what works for you.  the manual shows that you should use the metal ruler to measure the x axis on either side of the print bed beginning from the aluminum.  i think this is ""a pain in the tookus.""  remember hs when in science class they taught you to use a ruler and everyone had a different idea?  it was never consistent.  placing the ""block"" on the aluminum at the back end and lowering the x axis by manually turning the threaded rods will give you a consistent height for the x axis every time.  no bending over and going ""humm, is this right?  well maybe.""  duh!

now for the bed leveling screws.  i have over tightened and stripped the aluminum leading to replacing the aluminum bed.  you could sauder a hex nut to the back of the aluminum bed but that might eventually break.  orrrr, just tighten the bed leveling screws down till they are snug and given that the x axis is level go on to the next step.  

first i home when the bed is warm.  expansion.  also paper will burn at fahrenheit 351.  (never read the book)  that is 233 c. you don't need your bed or your nozzle that warm when you level.  that said, ""home all.""  watch to see if the nozzle forces the bed down.  you don't want that.  note that if your nozzle forces the bed down you can fix that by turning the z offset nob counter clockwise.  do it one turn then ""home all.""  make sure the bed is not forced down.  

this is why i put a white mark or ""tick"" on the nob.  i can tell how many turns i make and get pretty precise.  if the bed is not forced down -  here is the fun trick- you can slip or try to slip a piece of paper under the nozzle or your can use a bent finger gauge  (no paper, no fire).  if  you use a digital caliper, (you should have one because it really helps.) you will find that the thickness of a ""folded piece of paper"" is .18 mm.  trust me.  use your finger gauge and get .18 mm between your bed and n nozzle.  it's always reliable and it's slippery where paper is rough.  you will feel the difference but if the bed is not forced down when you slip the gauge under the nozzle you're golden.  business card stock varies in thickness (from .27 to .35mm) so, in my belief, it's unreliable.

now for the bed screws and springs.  yep! i note the same thing.  one or more corners will seem to be screwed down tighter than others, or the bed corner is higher on one side than another. it's called spring tension governed by the spring constant and i personally think it varies slightly from one spring to another.  unlevel bed corners catch on threads and stick.  i have to get an order of springs in one package and replace all of them to check but this has been a bother to me for a long time.  ...and yeah i have replaced my springs before.  same problem.  

another problem is that the bed corner gets caught on the ""inverted"" screw (mentioned above) and to level you have to push the bed corner down.  sometimes it will pop and the corner will level out or the corner will be visually unlevel.  you will have to ""dink' with it by raising the z offset nob then re-leveling. the point is to give yourself room to raise the bed levelers.  that is to say if the distance between the bed and the nozzle is too tight raise the z offset by a counter clockwise turn, check the space between the bed and the nozzle with your paper or finger gauge and if you have to because the bed is pushed down, repeat  until the (here is the trick with the leveling screws being too tight.) nozzle is raised sufficiently so as to ease the turning of the leveling screws and all four corners are even with the finger gauge at .18 mm between the bed and the nozzle. one other thing, i used a longer inverted ""stabilizing"" screw on the bed corner.  i just have a little more flexibility when adjusting the bed height.  i call them ""post screws"" because they look like posts and i think they should be smooth at a level above the aluminum because the threads serve no purpose and the levelers need to slide so they don't get caught when leveling the bed with the leveling screw.

one final thing before i confuse you more.  there is an exact number of turns of the allen wrench per fraction of a mm you raise the bed corner.  sorry, i have forgotten it for the moment but it will help you when you realize that you can divide precisely a complete turn and equate that with an increase in bed height. one turn equals x mm of height.     it's important if you are making molds and can get within .04 or in some cases .02 mm. takes a math nerd."
how to print a smooth surface?,"hi everyone, 

i am use taz 6, dual extruder v3 printing with pla in 205degree. after i updated the new cura, the printer was have a little stop time (about little than 0.5s) when printing. but this little stop time make the filament over extrude on one point. and produce a non- smooth surface(show in photo).

x-axis will not move in negative direction,"i have 2 taz 6's running off the same computer using simplify 3d. i use the same profiles for both printers, one is running just fine, the other went to hell and i can not for the life of me figure it out. i am sure it is something simple that i am missing (one can hope right?) 

issue: the extruder head will not move in the negative direction on the x-asis. it will more to the positive side (right) with no issues. i have made sure the motor is working correctly. also i have made sure the limit switch is function correctly. with having two identical printers, i am able to switch parts quickly and test if that is the issue or not. also, i have updated the firmware on the printer, again not thinking this would fix the issue because only one printer is having this issue. that was my last effort before turning the the forms. please help! 

visual aid: when i manually line everything up and start a print try to see what is going on, it will get to the wipe nozzle part, but refuse to move in both positive and negative directions on the x-axis. so i end up with the nozzle in the middle of the bed (thinking that his has wiped correctly) then goes to where it thinks the front right washer is for self leveling and starts to lower itself for that process. that is where i have to shut it off as it will push the nozzle straight into the middle of my printing surface.","definitely reach out to the support team, have a computer with the latest version of cura lulzbot edition handy as they'll want to run through some tests while connected through cura le: https://lulzbot.com/cura."

i am thinking this is a bed heat issue, should bringing the temp to 100 be good?


it is looking to be a temperature issue, but depending on the size of the print it will point in a few different heating possibilities. 

for the small part, it could be due to insufficient cooling time between layers. printing multiples of those (2-3) separated on the bed would allow more time cooling between layers. if that print looks better, you know it is a layer time/temperature issue on the hot end, and the bed will not be an issue.

for the larger part, i would recommend measuring how high up the part was before it started looking better and compare it to your settings. the fan settings in cura are set to ramp to the ""regular"" fan speed over x number of layers, or x height. it could be once the fan kicked in here, it resulted in more cooling, giving you a cleaner part.

the final one as you alluded to will be your bed. we recommend 105c-110c on the first layer to help bed adhesion with abs, but cura has a setting for further bed temperatures. that is, you can reduce the bed temp after the first layer to test if that is the issue."

thank you very much","post pictures of your hotend wiring , the extruder wire and the inside of the control box and i can tell you whats going on. chances are the extra wire is the taz 6 bed leveling wire, which you will not need. the error you are seeing probably means that you have the thermistor and the heater wires swapped. if you tried powering on the hotend with 24v of heater power going through the low voltage thermistor you may need a new thermistor now."

taz 6 with duet wifi board and bl-touch,"just wanted to post this quick video i took of my taz 6 which is now running off a duet wifi mainboard, a pitan extruder available on thingiverse and a bl-touch for bed leveling.  it's amazing how much quieter the printer is due to the higher microstepping from the duet wifi board.  the printer is now controlled right from my pc using a web interface and wifi.

i'm working on modifying the titan aero mount that itworks3d offers to work with this pitan extruder since i would rather the single 5015 blower fan.  i wanted to print reliably with 1.75mm filament so that i can share it between both my printers and this was the simplest solution i thought. i am putting together a similar extruder that will accept 2.85mm filament as well so i can just swap it easily and use both on the printer.

here's a short video showing how quiet my printer is now.

"new taz 6, tool head screw position misaligned?","hi everyone, i'm new to the forums and to 3d printing in general.

our lab has purchased a taz 6 + dual extruder v3 tool head and it's my task to set it up. after unboxing, i proceeded with the installation steps until the point where i should've mounted the tool head, however, i noticed that when the tool head's bottom part sits snugly and perfectly centered in the holder, the hole on the tool head and the screw hole on the frame are misaligned to an extent that i cannot fit the screw in the hole, not without moving the tool head to the side. i have the same situation with the included single extruder tool hear and the extra dual v3. the tray for the bottom of the tool head is free of dust or debris, and both tool heads fit nicely in, without any substantial space to move it in any direction - certainly not enough to align the two holes. i could tilt the head and fasten the screw, but then the bottom part is unstable = it hangs on the screw and can be wiggled left and right. surely, that's not the way it should be?

i'm assuming this problem could be ""user error"" due to my inexperience, so i'm posting it here first instead of contacting support. i hope veteran users can help me figure out what the problem is and how to proceed.

i've searched the forums for a solution without success, but may have missed relevant topics. if this has been discussed elsewhere, please point me to that thread.

i'm attaching a few pictures to illustrate the situation.","i had a similar issue with my dual extruder v3. the bottom wedge of the dual extruder was a tighter fit than the stock single extruder. since a slight misalignment of the single extruder isn't critical and the fit was looser, i was always able to get the top screw to fit.

i solved my issue by loosening the 4 screws that hold the bottom ""shoe"" and was then able to get the dual extruder top hole to line up correctly. you may have to lightly sand the rounded cutout at the bottom of the dual extruder if the fit is too tight. don't loosen the screws too much as they can't be tightened with the tool head in place.

the final step in this process is to carefully lower the dual extruder until both nozzles almost touch the bed and measure the gap for both nozzles. if positioned correctly, the gaps will both be the same.

after getting the dual extruder alignment solved, i discovered that the single extruder alignment also improved (i.e. the top hole lines up better as well)."

how to calibrate moto steps on taz6?,i printed a calibration cube (viewtopic.php?f=36&t=8009) and while the scaling has been helpful it is not a permanent solution. so i wanna know how to calibrate the steps per mm on the taz 6,"if you are talking about the x, y and z steps / mm then i did mine a similar way you do the extruder.  for the x i move it a little to the right of the left endstop and place a piece of tape on the top linear rod, then command the x to the right 100mm front the display and take a measurement. follow the same type of formula used for calibrating e-steps...  current steps / mm for that axis * 100 and then divide by the actual distance moved and that will give you the corrected steps / mm.  do the same for y and z.   for the extruder it's easier to measure 120mm of filament from the end of the lever you latch down that the filament goes through the notch..be sure the extruder is heated up to the high temperature range of the filament you have in it so it's more fluid, then extrude 100mm of filament.  then you measure the distance from the latch to the sharpie mark on the filament to figure out how much was actually extruded.  

so, if you have 15mm distance from the latch to the sharpie mark that means it extruded 105mm of filament so your formula would be current e-steps * 100  and then divide by 105 to give the new value.

once you figure all the values out you can adjust them through the display on the taz.  be sure to save them after you enter them.

i hope this helps."
clogged bore on taz6,my printer has stopped extruding filament. i thought it might be a clogged nozzle so i removed it and soaked it in acetone. while doing this i checked the bore and cannot see light through it. there is nothing visible from the top end to grab. looking into the bottom end i can see a clog about 18 mm in form the hot end. i do not know how to remedy the clogged bore. can someone assist me ?,"that sounds more like your cold end fan is not cooling enough. the stainless steel heat break is pretty hard. and is not a good conductor of heat(reason it is used). so the filament should stay cool enough until it is over half way through the heat break before it gets hot. 

side note: make very sure you do not turn the barrel cooling fan off(printer) until the hot end is 50c or cooler. otherwise the heat will travel up into the cold end and cause the filament to expand and create jams/clogs."
ticking on z-axis,"i've gone through the older posts on this, but still have not resolved the issue.

my taz 5 has started making a ticking sound when the z axis moves.  it has been getting progressively louder in the last couple days.  i've checked to make sure all of the fasteners are tight, that the coupler is not cracked, lubed the lead screw, but the ticking continues.

when using the lcd control to move the z-axis the ticking sound is consistent with every half revolution of the stepper motor.  this is happening on the left side only.   could i have a failing stepper motor?  

anything else i can troubleshoot?",thanks for the suggestion!  the sound is coming from the bottom end of the machine.  after taking some closeup pictures for customer support it's apparent there are cracks in the coupler.  the x-axis was 1-2mm off level which may or may not have contributed to the problem.  their suggestion is to re-align the stepper motor to the lead screw which i will do as soon as i get a replacement coupler.

1. rarely
2. not yet
3. i've never had to take the head apart. i use a nozzle cleaning filament and for the bad clogs, stop the cooling fan to use ""heat creep"" to soften any filament caught in that area of the tool head.

5. around $25. i already have octoprint."
dual v3 - a review - wait for v4? - heat creep still a problem,"i am new to 3d printing as of april 2018. this post is mainly for those interested in acquiring the dual v3 who also have little experience with 3d printing. it includes my troubleshooting processes and general tips/gotchas. my intention in purchasing the dual v3 was to print pla + pva (polydissolve in my case). let my 70+ hours of testing save you some time.

bottomline: i would either wait for the dual v4 or be willing to replace a fan on the dual v3 to solve its heat creep issue. i have returned my dual v3 after a month of attempts. however, know that plenty of people are having success with the v3.

note that i had printed with the single head for a month with no real issues. i was super impressed with how well the taz 6 with the single head worked out of the box. i went from the first sample print to being productive immediately. unfortunately, i didn’t have the same out of the box success with the dual v3. with a few tweaks to solve heat creep and easier loading of filament, i expect lulzbot’s dual v4 will be solid.

we picked up a dual v3 for our taz 6 near end of may. i checked the serial number to ensure sure it wasn’t going to have the thermal runaway problems of the early shipments. see service bulletin: https://www.lulzbot.com/sites/default/f ... etin_2.pdf 

my setup:
dual v3
taz 6
cura: v3.2.21
marlin firmware v1.1.8.59

pla + pva
i started with lulzbot’s example “impossible gears”. the first attempt failed (i don’t recall why). the second attempt was successful. both prints used esun’s pla+ and polymaker’s polydissovle s1. i had the pla in extruder 1 (e1 - left) and the polydissolve in extruder 2 (e2 - right).

following that, i was unable to achieve a single successful print using pla and pva. the feeder wheel would grind away at the filament, and then had nothing to bite into to feed the filament. at the beginning, i thought i was having issues with the pva burning and clogging the head preventing the filament from feeding, even though my temperatures were never above 220. i could push filament through manually so i knew it wasn’t clogged. only pva had been run in e2 at this point. it took around five cold pulls to achieve a clean head, including one using pla. to avoid future burning of pva, i thought i’d run lower temperatures. i moved to 210, 205, and then 190. i didn’t see any more buring. still, the print attempts failed due to filament grinding issues, primarily e2 with the pva. every time i had a filament grinding issue, i would check to see if the nozzle was clogged by whether or not i could push filament through manually. this proved that clogging was not an issue, and therefore not causing the filament grind. i was trying to print a disc about 150mm in diameter. there would be quite a bit of time that one extruder head would be sitting at standby temperature (180) while the other head was printing. i thought perhaps when the extruder that was standing by is called to print, the filament wasn’t molten enough and it could be having difficulty getting started and that resistance could cause the filament grinding. (you can still push pla or pva through the head manually when head temp is at 180.) so i raised the initial temperature to that higher than the printing temperature, hoping the overshoot would solve any resistance issues. this did not solve the issue. user kcchen_00 says that the dual v3 likes running hot so i went the opposite direction than my earlier tests and heated things up. the pva shouldn’t burn at 220 and so i tried printing pla at 230 and polydissolve at 220. still no luck, the filament grinding issue wouldn’t go away. (i didn’t see any burning of the pva.)

at two different points in my testing i had baked the pva in the oven at low temp (170f) for a few hours to remove any moisture it had absorbed, in case that was the issue with the initial burning i had seen. 

amidst tests, i did have a successful test using pla in both e1 & e2. 

in my tests i also disabled any retraction, though no matter what, there is always retraction on layer change (or at least when there's a tower in the mix). in the end, retraction or not, that’s not the issue. similarly, i reduced retraction, acceleration, jerk, and printing speeds. it didn’t help.

heat creep!
it took me a lot of forum reading, but i finally found a thread that led me to the topic ‘heat creep’. heat creep causes the filament to get soft near the feeder. when the feeder gear turns, it just slips on the softened filament and chews away at it. this is what i had been fighting the whole time.


abs + hips
once i learned about heat creep, i figured i would try abs and hips: filaments that require higher temperatures and therefore may be less prone to heat creep softening the filament. 

e1:abs   e2:hips   e2 failed perhaps a couple hours in due to heat creep (filament grind). because most of the heat creep fails were with e2, and usually support material, i switched materials around:    e1:hips   e2:abs. the 37 hour print finished without any heat creep failure! the hips and abs didn’t adhere to each other, but that has nothing to do with the dual v3. 

pla + pva (again)
given that success, i thought i’d go back and try pla + pva again, but switch which extruder head they were in.   e1:pva   e2:pla.   e2 failed after the first layer or two due to heat creep. (filament grind). 

abs + pva
i had seen some people having success with abs + pva. so, i thought i’d give that a try. e1:pva  e2:abs.   the first 9 hour print was a success! after having spent the prior three weeks with nothing but failures with the pva, this was encouraging.

i then tried to repeat the same 9 hour print but it failed. e1 clogged about half-way through. this was my first clogging issue with the dual v3. in this case it looked like the pva had burned. it was the first time after a fail i couldn’t ‘easily’ push filament through the head by hand. after a couple cold pulls with pla, it was back to good. however, at this point my return window had closed, it was time to give up and return the dual v3.

conclusion
being new to 3d printing, it wasn’t until nearing the end of the return window that i learned that what i was facing was heat creep. i had spent at least 70 hours between scouring the forums and baby sitting prints and tweaking parameters in cura, trying to get successful prints. in the end it became clear that tweaking parameters in cura was completely unnecessary. for the most part, you should be able to use default profile settings for your filament of choice and have success. fighting heat creep can’t be won by tweaking parameters. my take is that tweaking parameters is really more about getting cleaner prints, not about getting the printer to work.

if i still owned the dual v3, i’d be replacing the heat sink fan with a higher flow rate fan to solve heat creep. i believe joebowler300 found success after replacing the fan with a higher flow rate (cfm) fan:

print with sd card
between people saying cura or their computer crashes or sleeps mid-print, and not wanting to be tethered to the printer, i print solely with the sd card and never had an issue.


loading filament
some people have mentioned problems loading filament. 
viewtopic.php?f=36&t=7151&p=39892&hilit=dual+v3#p39440

i can agree with that it is difficult at first, but after some tips and practice, it won’t take much effort. i like the filament to arc clockwise for e1 and counter clockwise for e2...and cut a taper on the end of the filament, more easily done with a dedicated pair of dikes vs the provided pliers/cutters. position such that the pointed tip is down (see pic, notably the black filament). with my idler arms set with the spacer tool while no filament is loaded, and even with an additional turn or two, i don’t have any problems loading filament when squeezing the idler arms. i can push it all the way down into the extruder head, though you could stop once you got past the feeder wheel and then turn the thumb wheel to finish pulling it in.

firmware gotcha:
watch out...if you press pause on the lcd mid-print, it will resume at the correct layer as expected, but will shift in x and y by about 5mm each. you can’t recover a print after that. stay away from the pause button! i made a post on this. viewtopic.php?f=8&t=7581&p=41787#p41787

this only affects the dual v3, not the single head.

expect this to be fixed in the next firmware update. 

cura buggy:
not all project settings saved:
beware that when you save a project in cura, it doesn’t save all the settings...or it doesn’t recall all of the settings.  brim/skirt is one of those bugs. be sure to review your settings!

change colors at wrong layer:
you can tell cura to “change color” at a specific layer and it will inject the commands into the gcode. however, it’s off by a couple layers. i specified layer 40, and when printing, it paused at layer 38.

hangs on slicing:
i’ve had many occasions where cura can’t finish slicing the file. it hangs trying to “prepare”. i often adjusted layer height to get it to compile. once, i had to switch to a similar profile.

printing one at a time:
if you have multiple objects to print on your bed, and they are small/shallow enough such that the head won’t run into the other prints while printing, you can tell cura to print one at a time, versus printing all at once layer by layer. watch out, cura will move your parts to where it believes there won't be any interference. visually things looked great in cura, but when it printed, one of my two parts was printed at the edge of bed, way off from where cura visually said it was, and the brim was printed on the metal z-zero-ing disc which meant the nozzle was forced to rise over that disc.  viewtopic.php?f=8&t=7648

recover failed prints
learn how to recover a failed print, this can save you print time. simply put, say your print fails at layer 32, you can hack your gcode by removing most all the commands prior to layer 32, save that file and then have the printer run it, and it will start at layer 32 and continue with your print. i did this about five times with success. i didn’t find any straightforward lulzbot taz 6 specific tutorials (video or writeup) on how to do this, but after some testing eventually figured it out. i know it would be helpful to make a separate post on how to do this, but i don’t want to spend the time, given the accumulated time i’ve put into testing and writing already. but here’s a gotcha - it is necessary that the head runs through the auto-leveling routine first, it cant just resume printing at layer 32 cuz it can be off by a significant amount (i’ve seen 4mm). the auto-leveling routine moves the head from corner to corner, and therefore could collide with your existing print. if your print is not shallow enough, or in the way, you must start your print from scratch.


wheel motion indicators
one thing i found helpful while troubleshooting was to put little pieces of tape on the thumb wheels so that it was easy to see which way the wheels were moving etc ( such as looking for retraction). to the lulzbot team, it would cost more time to print, and would require a dual head printer to print them, but you could print bright green dots near the perimeter of the wheels. see the attached pic.","i found this dual extruder v3 fan duct and the description makes a lot of sense so i printed one for my taz 6. 

after a bit of fiddling with the wiring harness, i was able to get enough slack in the stock fan wiring to use it without any cutting and soldering of the wires.

the original author used pla but i used petg because i had some. abs would also work and might have a bit higher heat tolerance.

i haven't had a lot of heat creep issues with my dual extruder but i believe this will help and i'll report back when i have more time using this new fan duct. 

i have a noctua nf-a4x20 5v fan on the shelf which will be my next modification (mounted on this fan duct) if necessary."
taz 6 not powering up,"not sure what may have happened, but my taz ran over night and when i woke up it was on with the lcd off and just the red power button on. i've opened up the side and the main fuse looks fine. any ideas what to check?","vel0c1ty wrote: ?tue mar 26, 2019 7:14 am
any ideas what to check?


start by checking the to 5a nano poly fuses:



 rambo fuse locations 


the usual cause of a blown fuse, would be a short to your hot end. never use any metallic objects when cleaning the nozzle. inspect both sets of wires (thermistor and hot end) going into your heater block, to ensure the insulation is preventing a short.

you can see the f3 fuse controls the logic, and that one could have been blown. you can swap the f2 and the f3 fuse to power up the machine and verify, but it will not be able to move motors."
taz6 bed vibration,"my bed has started to vibrate when moving (see movie) and i cannot detect where the vibration is coming from. it is getting worse the more i print. i have wiped the rails with a microfiber dry cloth and the bed motor seems tight in its mount. the belt also seems snug.

taz 6 - not reading sd card,"new taz 6 yesterday, working mostly.  but will not read the lulzbot supplied sd card.  card works in pc.  gui reads ""card inserted"" but ""no sd card"" in the first menu.  tried a different micro sd in same adapter supplied with no luck.  scouring to find another standard sd card to try, but posing in the meantime.

ideas?

-pwon","i had the same problem today. i have a 64 gb card around and i tried to use that one to print. ""card inserted"" but then ""no sd card"". i saw a post where someone said that you could download a software to correctly format sd cards from https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter_4/index.html

tried that, reformated using the software tool, but didn't solve the problem. i saw another comment about usb should not be connected at the same time, to be able to read the card, but when i use the small 8 gb card that came with the printer, still with usb connected, it can read that small card. the problem seems to be with the large one. 

is there any limit in the card memory size? does it have to be only a small mnemory card to be able to read it? the small card is 30 mb/s, the large one is 80 mb/s. could that be another reason too?"
cura first layer,cura shows polylite first layer (fast print) at .43mm should the first layer be .43mm then?  thanks,"ideally yes.  if you have .50 nozzle, it's hard to get that big a first layer, though.

when i print a calibration cube, i set the first layer to the same height as the others (usually 0.20 or 0.25 is my preference).

some may argue that setting a large first layer height is necessary because the intention is to ""squash"" that layer onto the bed -- i don't think that's true.  there's usually a setting in the slicer for over-extruding that first layer to help that ""squash"", and the intention is that the first layer height is to be honored by the printer."
wiper hand tool... free stl file,here's one i made as a test trying to see what kind of speed this has.... standard print then cranked up the speed from 100 to 150 on the printer i don't know what that is in mm per sec anyone know?

cooling fan overdrive?,"i've had my taz 6 running for several weeks now, my first 3d printer, and have been producing what i'd consider largely successful prints (pla is thankfully very forgiving).

in playing around with settings on both the printer itself and through cura, i found that the cooling fans can be set to operate at over 100% (and they'll actually spin faster).  i believe they're simply dc fans, so i assume this just cranks the supply voltage even higher than whatever it is at 100% (i've no idea what the maximum output capability from the control board is, or what the maximum spec of the fans themselves is - i haven't pushed past 150% for fear of disastrous consequences).

does anyone make common practice of running their cooling fans at over 100%?  i'm mainly referring to the single extruder toolhead that comes with the printer, but i'm currently running the aerostruder head, and it can be set to a higher-than-100% cooling fan speed as well.","cg49me wrote: ?thu jan 24, 2019 8:14 pm

the gcode command to control the cooling fan is m106 s<0-255> where 0 is off and 255 is full speed. curale 3.2.32 uses 0-100% but if i try to set it to 101%, it turns red. i believe the fan control from the lcd on my taz 6 uses the 0-255 range and won't go higher than 255.

in curale, where can you set the fan speed to 150%? can you provide a screenshot? on the printer lcd, are you assuming that the units are percentage?"
pei lifting off from bed,"trying to print a big volume half part of a box on pla from polymaker (see slicer image on attachments). +24 hours later i noticed that the pei sheet lifted off on various points of the bed. i have a couple of theories but i've always struggled on having a nice warm temperature inside the enclosure of the taz 6 the acrylic one. the printer is located in a drafty environment. i'm waiting for the print to end to see if i have to replace the pei. didn't use any glue, didn't show any lift before this print. (see bed images on attachments)

1) any ideas on how to deal with this? (maybe some heaters inside so have a really hot enclosed temperature?)
2) would i have this problem if i had the abs enclosure? (how better is it against the pure acrylic one?)
3) would i have this problem if i had the modular bed? (how better is it against the old one?)",">>i have a couple of theories but i've always struggled on having a nice warm temperature inside the enclosure of the taz 6 the acrylic one. <<

someone correct me if i am wrong, but you want pla to cool as quickly as possible.  that's why i am building an enclosure that i can run a spot cooler into to make the environment cool.  abs (and others, like ngen) are a different story."
old vs new enclosure for the taz6,"do the different materials really add up to temperature dissipation? 
i'm skeptical only that change can make it deal better in a drafty environment.","that's a very complex question with an answer of ""it depends"". there are a dozen variables specific to a given material. abs is one of the more difficult ones to print and the one where most people start needing an enclosure but it is not an absolute requirement. materials that shrink as they cool, like abs and materials that don't bond strongly to cold material, again like abs are the ones that benefit most from an enclosure. 

you can also improve adhesion by increasing the strength of the first layer bond by using a pei or buildtak sheet, printing hotter and faster to improve interlayer adhesion. other things like improving layer geometry by adding stiffer more constrained axis bearings and making for more consistent layer thickness throughout the part can help. 

but to answer your question, an enclosure will usually help for materials that are prone to lifting or shrinking. if you are printing pla it won't help. you can test this by making a temporary enclosure out of cardboard and or a turkey roasting bag. just make sure the control box is outside the enclosure or you will melt your rambo board. 

there are also downsides such as softened frame parts and lower motor life since the motors get a bit hotter than normal wear that way."
source for 0.35 mm nozzle taz 5,"anyone know where i can buy a 0.35mm nozzle tip? from reading other threads the taz 5 has a longer nozzle that goes deeper into the hot end so not any hexagon nozzle will work. i contacted lulzbot and they told me that they can sell me a new 0.5mm hotend assembly, but not just a nozzle. i would like the a 0.35mm for detail prints. anywhere i can buy just blank nozzles and machine them out?
thanks",you can use any standard e3dv6 nozzle safely with the taz hexagon and vice versa. the hexagon relies on the nozzle tightened to the heater block and will accept either style.  you just need the threads long enough to fit into the block. be aware that snapping the heat break will void your extruder warranty so care is required. use a crescent wrench to hold the heat break when removing the nozzle. for a taz 6 or a mini avoid any nonconductive nozzles like the olsen ruby.
taz 5 dual extruder v3 issues,"hey everyone,

been working with my dev3 for a while and it's causing some high levels of frustration.

1) no matter what i do, the feeder gears chew up the filament and make it impossible for it to grab and feed. this happens with both extruders. this is getting to the point where it's wasting all of the test polydissolve that was included with the dev3. i calibrated it with the included idler tool and this still happens. it feels like it's getting jammed in the nozzle somehow. i then have to remove the filament, the idler, and then clean that feeder gear, which is extremely tedious doing it every single time i load filament.
2) i manually set the z-offset and after i start a print it seems like it completely disregards what i set and it appears to be up a millimeter or two, or it looks like it's directly on the build plate or even pushing down on it. i used a thin piece of paper as a spacer (actually the z-offset card from my robo r2) on all 4 corners with both extruders and it feels fine up until a print gets started.
also since the taz 5 doesn't have a z-offset setting anymore for some reason, i mean i'm setting the end stop.

i have not had a successful print at all.
it doesn't even extrude filament during prints.

please help me.
this has gotten to the point beyond frustrating.

-dave","doesn't look like there is a z-offset stored in the eeprom.  it would be the m206 line.

are you heating up the nozzles before using the feeler (business card) to check nozzle height?

make sure to clean the teeth on the hobbed gear after the filament is ground down.  how deep are the grinds in the filament (how much filament is left of the 3mm... 2mm or 1mm)?

what are you feeding into t0/e1/left extruder?  try an inexpensive filament like pla or abs...

after you remove the filament, are there teeth marks left left from the hobbed gear?


i'd normally say to extrude a little hotter and give the idler screws another turn..."
taz 3 with taz 5 extruder,"hi all,

i hope you will be able to help me out with something.  i have a taz 3 with taz 5 printer head.  i have the firmware flashed to a taz 5.  the everything seems to be functioning well enough in repetier-host but the print quality is quite bad.  my question is should i flash the firmware back to a taz 3?

also, i suspect that the pla filament profile (slic3r) and printer setup profile on repetier-host both need to be reconfigured.  i had a volunteer 3d printer wizard custom configure the profiles but it is obvious that they still need some reconfiguring.  i have been looking without success for some pre-configured profiles for which i can just upload to repetier-host.  does anyone know or have something like that?  i am really close to getting this somewhat modified taz 3 back up and running again so i can print out larger objects.

thanks!

hey guys, 

hate to interrupt this thread but i have a very similar problem. recently bought a taz 3 on ebay and did all the necessary upgrades to taz 5. i flashed the rambo board with the taz 5 firmware but the prints are coming out like crap as well. 

when i say i upgraded to taz 5, what i replaced was the z-axis to lead screws, x-axis plates, tool head to hexagon hotend, and build plate with pei. i figured all i would have to do was flash to taz 5 firmware, but after doing so my prints just look horrible compared to my other 3 taz 5/6s. 

i believe we both may be having the same issue? if anything, you arnt alone with having print issues. 

here is an incomplete benchy i tired printing. 



thanks


it looks like there may be a couple things at play in regards to the print quality here. it looks like your first layer is probably a bit too squished based on how indistinct the writing on the bottom of the benchy is and the bit of elephant footing that is present around your bottom layer. here is a photo showing what a good first layer will look like based on squish:





to adjust your z-offset i would start by making sure the bed is well leveled, since you just did several modifications on the printer. leveling the bed on a taz can be a little tricky until you get the hang of it. the most common issue new customers run into is making too large of adjustments to the corner pieces. in order to have a good starting point, lets reset your bed. you are going to want to compress the corner springs to 3/4ths their maximum position. the easiest way to do this is to place your finger underneath the aluminum build plate, and tighten all for corners until the screws are sticking out to the same length. this gives a base starting point that allows for tightening and loosening on all 4 corners.

once the bed is reset we need to set the initial z height before making any corner adjustments. measure the distance from the aluminum plate to the lower horizontal smooth rod of the x axis on both the right and left hand side. this should be equidistant. if an adjustment is required, turn off your printer and manually turn one of the threaded rods up or down to make the left and right hand side equal. using a business card between the glass plate and the nozzle, home your printer. when it has finished moving, you should feel a slight tension on the card from the nozzle and the bed. if this pressure is not present, or is more than slight you will need to adjust your z axis thumb screw and re-home. once this is set in the home position, we can test the other three corners.

turn off your printer or disable your stepper motors to allow manual movement of the bed and tool head. move the tool head and the bed to test all 4 corners approximately 1 inch in from the sides. you should feel the same slight tension on the card on all four spots. if needed, adjust the bed corners to achieve this. the bed corners work much in the same way as replacing a car tire. you will want to make small adjustments as changing one corner will affect the other three. the business card it just a quick set in order to get your bed calibration print to stick. fine adjustments will be made after the bed calibration print to achieve the proper height as highlighted in step 5 of your quick start guide.

it also looks like you might have some over extrusion, i am thinking this will be due to the print temperature being a bit higher than necessary. what filament and settings were you using when you printed this? when you flashed your firmware up to a taz 5 were you using the newest version of cura? if so did you make sure to adjust the e-steps afterwards to make sure they were correct for your extruder? if you are uncertain if the e-steps are correct we have a guide for calibrating your extruder which you can use to verify that you are extruding correctly: https://ohai.lulzbot.com/workflow/fine- ... libration/"
taz 6 not extruding,"hi!

i have a lulzbot taz 6 and a new problem has occurred. whenever i attempt to extrude, a very small stream comes out. i have cleaned the nozzle multiple times and when i manually push the filament through the nozzle a stream comes out without issue. whenever i go to print little to nothing comes out. i think it might be an issue with the gears pushing down the filament, but i haven't figured out a way to fix it. has anyone had this issue and do they know how to fix it? thanks so much!!",could be that the nozzle is clogged or your idler arm is too tight. only make it so there is just enough force for filament to extrude otherwise it could just grind away the filament and not feed (especially on softer materials). check to make sure there isn't ground up plastic in the hobbed bolt gears and also make sure that the knurled part of the hobbed bolt lines up well with where the filament path is.
auto leveling malfunction,"hi,

i’ve been using my taz 6 with no issues for almost one year (since feb). all of a sudden the nozzle does not descend enough when trying to measure the 4th corner during calibration and cames out with a “failed to cleanup nozzle” error, that is bogus since it does not lower the nozzle enough to touch, has nothing to do with cleanup.

here are the details:

it does correctly the first 3 corners, however at the 4th one when it does the first rough estimate, that is lowering at fast speed, it stops about 1mm above the round button and gives up. if it would lower just a bit more it would touch it, but it stops too soon.

oddly enough the following workaround makes it work (for now): when calibrating the 4th corner and just when the nozzle starts moving down i put the blade of the knife between the button and the nozzle and since the blade is >1mm it will make contact, with this it will continue fine with the 2nd fine measurement (slow speed) and oddly enough with this one it does go lower enough to touch and everything it’s fine from there. for the 2nd (fine) measurement i don’t have to put the blade so the measurement is valid, that’s why prints came out fine.

any ideas what causes this? is there a switch/ limiter somewhere that tells it how low to try and go for the initial rought measurement on the 4th corner? same setting i touched by mistake? (i already reset the settings)

any help is much appreciated

if the corners are being tapped without any deflection, try this:

turn the printer off.
slowly move the toolhead to position the nozzle over the front right corner washer.
manually turn the right leadscrew until the nozzle is slightly above the washer. visually match what the left one looked like.

prints shifting on taz 6,"i have a taz 6 that over the past couple weeks has started shifting midway through longer pla prints.  i have been trying to troubleshoot it using info from various sources, but so far, no luck.

a few details on my taz 6 and things i've tried:
it is less than 2 years old - most prints i do are 6 hours or less.  i don't run it 24/7 at most a few hours a day and there is not a lot of wear on the machine (looks new).
it is in an enclosure - however the electronics have air pulled in from outside the enclosure.  i have a thermometer inside the electronics chamber and it stays 65-70f when printing.  i also added heatsinks to the top of the driver chips as a troubleshooting step (assuming y driver was overheating).
in addition to the electronics chamber, i have a thermometer inside the enclosure - temp is normally 65-70 and i leave a couple doors open when printing pla. 
i mainly use pla and haven't tried any other material - trying to fix it with pla first.
it seems to only shift halfway through prints over 4 hours.
it is always the y axis that shifts (see attached image).
the size of the part doesn't make a difference:  ie i've printed things as small as filament clips and it will still shift.
i did a 16 hour print a week ago and it did not shift - not every print shifts.
i've checked the stepper motor, shaft set screws, belt tension, and as many mechanical things as i could think to check - all seems ok.
the issue happens with brand new filament rolls that i know are not tangled.
most 2-3 hour prints do not shift.

before i start replacing stepper motors and rambo boards, i wanted to see if anyone here has any further ideas i could try.","looks like i've been searching the forums for the wrong terms.  i found a couple posts on ""misaligned printing"" and  ""stepped and jagged printing"" that showed similar issues to mine.  piercet suggested checking the y-axis belt which i am embarrassed to say i didn't think to check.  tonight i flipped over my printer and my y belt did not make a ""guitar pluck sound.""  in fact, every single m3 screw under my printer was loose.  the y belt may have been tight at one point, but with loose tension screws i am not surprised it came loose.

everything is tight now, and i was able to play stairway to heaven on my x and y belts.  hopefully that solves the issue."

there are two big changes on the mini 2 to reduce noise. the first is the einsry retro electronics board which uses the tmc2130 drivers. these drivers have a ""stealthchop"" mode which gives the motors much quieter movement.

the second aspect will be the move the belt driven z axis. this different drive train provide smooth movement without requiring the metal rod to raise the carriage.

if the z axis is causing the most noise by your ears, some white lithium grease on the z threaded rod only may help: https://www.lulzbot.com/maintaining-your-3d-printer (do not put any on the smooth rods.)

new taz 5 owner needs help,"hello all. i am completely new to my taz and also completely new to 3d printing. i did a little research and decided on buying a taz over an ultimaker 2 basically because of the build volume and quality. i think that once i get the hang of making good prints the larger build volume on the taz will be more often what i need. my problem is that so far everything that i have printed has been extremely rough looking. i'm not exactly sure how to dial the taz in yet and i have been getting horrible results. i'm sure it's more user error than it is machine or software issue. i just need a little advice. i'll be the first to admit that i am not 100% sure that i have leveled the bed correctly. i have tried about 4 different times and all have had the same result. i read the manual on leveling and it said to make sure that you had firm pressure on the paper that you use. the lulzbot youtube channel has a video and there it says you should only have light pressure on the paper. i am confused to say the least. i also tried to use the bed leveling wizard that is included in cura. that actually has you raise the platform until it touches the nozzle. i did get ok results with that method for one print, but i still wasn't sure if that was the correct way to do it. does the bed leveling wizard work? is there anyway that you can be 100% sure that you have the bed leveled to the correct height? also, i'll attach some pics and maybe you guys can spot other problems with what i am doing wrong. thanks for your help in advance. i look forward to making some great prints with this thing when i get it dialed in. hopefully i can share some nice things with you guys in the future.

i forgot to mention above what my settings are. 
i'm using lulzbot hips filament with the downloaded profiles from the lulzbot site. the roctopus and the open hardware keychain were printed with no changes to the fine setting. the bull i actually slowed the print speed down to 40mm/s. i read that even if i use the quickprint settings in cura, they are the same as the ones you download from the site. so i'm not sure what parameters i need to change to get better prints. the octopus that they printed on the machine before it was sent to me, turned out beautifully. it's very smooth and even looking. i know they used abs but i'm sure i should be able to get the same results with hips.














","dear brother from another mother!  it's been 4 years since you posted this request but i wanted to reply for the sake of those like us who had trouble mastering bed leveling.

it took me almost 2 years to figure out the following because i was having problems with the thermistor on my printer and lulzbot support kept giving me software fixes that didn't work.

step 1:  leveling the x-axis.  i could not convince anyone i spoke with at lulzbot that iwe  work with 3 parallel planes.  my aluminum build plate needs to be totally parallel to the x-axis ""track"" on which the print head moves.  in order to be completely level, the glass plate eg print bed, needs to be parallel to both the aluminum build plate and the x-axis.  lulzbot support people kept telling me that my assumption was invalid because i was not accounting for the level of the table.  use a digital level or an app on your cell phone.  i found a helpful solution.  i cut a 6"" width of thin plywood that i am using to make cabinets ( just happened to have it.) about 50  mm wide on a miter saw or miter box.  (it's really helpful with wrapping a piece of sand paper around when you recondition your pei)

i got this through experimentation.  it works for me but you may find your own measurement if you want. 

trying to judge the space between the aluminum build plate and the bottom x-axis is a pain in the rear because perspective affects judgement of the ruler ticks as anyone who has done the experiment with reading a ruler in middle school can tell you.  the width of the plywood piece is always constant. you may not even have to be sober to get it right.

2. level between the glass plate and nozzle  i love macgyver mentalities but a business card to measure the distance between the nozzle and the build glass has a big disadvantage.  please check this out with a local print company if you think i am nuts.  the quality of the business card makes a difference in the thickness of the business card.  after measuring business card stock i found that the thickness of business cards can vary anywhere between .27 to .34 mm.  when you level your bed religiously, you will also wear out the paper and the thickness will vary.  a bent feeler gauge will never wear out.  i settled on 0.3mm but you may want to go as low on the feeler gauge as .28.  it's up to you because the first layer is yours.  

now this point is important:  whether you are using the feeler gauge or the business card notice if you are pushing the bed down on the springs. if that is happening the nozzle is too tight against the measuring device.  you want the nozzle firm against the (in my case) feeler gauge but not so firm that when you pull the gauge out you can see the bed lift up.  not to over stress a point you also don't want to push the bed down when you slip your measuring device between the bed and the nozzle. 
we all have different levels of sensitivity in our fingers so this is the most objective way to judge the process.  if on the other hand you are using a business card do not push the card in if it is tending to peel the paper on the outside of the card.  it's a cheap business card anyway but the nozzle is too close to the bed.

3. now here is where the rubber hits the road.  i tend to be a bit extreme.  i print 4 narrow rectangles on each corner of the glass and a 5th in the middle.  this ""targeting"" technique is a principle of statistics.  for my purposes i used a rectangular part from the murobo laser printer because i knew that it was designed to be exactly 4.5 mm thick.  yep! i asked.  the longer parts will show if there is a variance in bed level from one end to the other.  (i said i am extreme but that is what you get if you have a degree in analytical chemistry and a standard at the bureau of standards.) you can do this with minimum infill so they cost practically nothing.
this works because there is something that not a lot of people know.  each full turn of the ""sock headed"" screws raises the bed .5 mm.  now if you think of the corner of the bed as being a quarter of a clock or about 15 minutes you have the ability to minutely adjust the level of the bed because each 12 ""minutes"" of the allen wrench equals 0.2 degrees or .1 mm and each 6 ""minutes"" therefore equals 0.05 mm.  there is nothing wrong with putting quarter clock faces on the corners of your bed till you get the feel of it.  from a statistical point of view the middle print will be almost the exact average of the thickness of each of the 4 corners.  adjust your 4 corners to the thickness of the middle print.

for many other things i am a master maker and i really hate guesswork."
6000 members,6500 topics ....,"i understand the frustration. maybe this will help.

the noise you are hearing on the z movement isn't uncommon. lightly lube your leadscrews with white lithium grease.

stop worrying about the printer and bed and x axis being level to the world. set the bubble level to the side for a few minutes. what you want is to have your x axis in the same plane with the y.

based on what you are seeing with the dial indicator, your x axis is not running parallel with the plane of the bed.

jog your toolhead so the nozzle tip is ever so slightly above the front left corner washer. 
turn the printer off.
slowly move the toolhead to position the nozzle over the front right corner washer.
manually turn the right leadscrew until the nozzle is slightly above the washer. visually match what the left one looked like.
move the toolhead back to the left washer and adjust with the leadscrew.
continue alternating until the nozzle is above left and right washers by the same distance.
use the nozzle to do this rather than the dial indicator. the nozzle is the thing that matters.
run a test print.

if you have manipulated each corner of the bed to achieve a bubble level, you might need to remove all that and go back to the stock setup. you want the glass to be mounted down to the bed plate the same way on all four corners. this will work unless the bed plate is jacked up or the printer is out of square or bent in some way.

let us see the results and we can go from there."
taz 4 hardened steel hobbed bolt,"i'm looking into printing carbon fiber with my taz 4.  i'm planning on using an olsson ruby nozzle but it was recommended that i also change to a hardened steel hobbed bolt.  can anyone suggest a non-sketchy vendor where i could find this bolt?  i found a couple but reliability of the sites was questionable at best.

"taz 6, slop?","i've been noticing more and more some really pronounced banding in my prints.  in the attached picture i have some good examples.  these were all printed with polylite pla, first three were using the provided cura ""quick print"" profile and the last three on ""high detail""  it doesn't seem to matter which settings/speeds i use and it doesn't seem to follow any regular pattern like it's a z-axis issue.  i find the same bands using both the stock .5mm nozzle print head and with a .3mm nozzle tool head i built myself, though much less pronounced with the .3mm tool head.  also the bands seem to be around the entire part for the whole layer, not just one particular side or the other.

right now i'm just looking for other things to try or suggestions from the community on if i can make this better on my own, if this is just how it should be, or if i should get support involved.

so far i've done the following:
tightened up both the x and y-axis belts.
ensured x-axis is level to bed and top of frame.
greased z-axis lead screws.
checked all issues in service bulletins (no heatsink on drivers, frame square, etc).
measured all filaments i use over several meters to check consistency and update values if needed.
calibrate e-steps, within a mm or two of 100mm with idler tensioned using provided jig files (both with jig between washers and between thumbscrew heads and idler).
tried just flat out printing slower.

things i've observed:
i can wiggle the tool head a little bit, but it takes quite a bit of force, i don't think that normal printing movement would be able to wobble it much.
the bed does seem to have a bit of play, but as with the tool head it seems to take a fair amount of force.","siropoly wrote:pyrokld wrote:siropoly wrote:so i am in the same boat here, see the attached pictures. brand new taz 6, 1 week old today, and has never printed with out this level of banding or worse. contacted support, have gone through all sorts of troubleshooting steps and have even more to go through. so far nothing has worked. now i have noticed that my x and y axis are not quite ""smooth"" in their movement, but nothing is loose or out of wack that i can see. also in two of the attached there is a corner that you can see the layers are off on either the x or the y axis every other step. if anyone else here has gone through this same sort of issue i would be greatly interested in hearing what resolved it for you.

i still have my banding on all of my prints and have even gone as far as removing the z-axis rods to make sure they weren't bent.  i'm at a point with support where they want me to mail it in, and i am debating if i want to spend the 90 dollars to ship it to them for repair or replacement or keep trying.  my first one was much worse, but was able to just exchange through amazon for free because it was within the first 30 days, but with this one i had the nozzle break off the extruder and ended up waiting past the 30 day amazon return for them to send me a new extruder.

these are my prints over the past two weeks working with support (in chronological order), starting to think this is as good as it's going to get with the stock design.  these are using two different extruders too, my stock on and a .3mm one i put together myself.

pyrokld, i am right here with you. i too got mine from amazon and luckily am still within the 30 day window, this is week two. i completely feel that this printer was just badly beaten during shipping and something has shifted or broken that i can not seem to find or fix. clearly the demo print that came with the printer was perfect, and everything i've printed since getting it has been layer misstep. i too went to the point of taking apart the z axis and checking the bearings, printed parts, couplers, tightened all of the belts, x axis rods and z axis rods/screws to see if they are bent. the attached are two prints, after rebuild, were ran separately but with no tuning between prints. if you look the layer lines are inconsistent in where the missteps take place. i also made a bone fish and the layer missteps are not consistent across the bones (let me know if you want a picture of it, a pretty cool print). this leads me to think something other than the z axis is having issues. could be slop in the x axis or the head of the printer. weird though that this design would kick out a perfect test print and then not be able to get the layers to line up at all after shipping.... i'd really hate to return this as i like the printer, just wish it could print consistently....

i don't know what type of filament you are using, but some of the artifacts i see in your 3dbenchy prints look exactly like problems i've had when using damp petg filament.  in particular, the jagged ""growths"" seen in the cabin door openings and the jagged rail.   damp filament will ""ooze"" excessively, too much for retraction to correct.   it can also exacerbate the banding issues.

and just because a new roll of filament came sealed in a bag, with desiccant, doesn't mean it is dry.  i have had several spools of filament purchased from various suppliers, and one directly from taulman, arrive vacuum-sealed with desiccant -- but the filament had significant moisture and problems printing.  

you might try baking the filament in an oven for a few hours to see if it helps.   bake pla at 45c, abs and nylons at 65c, for at least 4 hours (8 hours is better for nylon).  then repeat your 3dbenchy and see if there is improvement."
taz 6: two corners of build plate too low,"i've got two corners of my build plate  (upper right and lower left) that are consistently lower than the other three.  it's making it impossible to print out a bunch of copies of an item while maintaining a smooth first layer.  i have tried: making sure the x axis is level, making sure the bolts on the probing pads are nice and tight, leveling the rods in the y axis and making sure they are parallel, making sure the z-axis has no binding in it, making sure the nozzle and probing pads are clean (and watching it closely as it levels), and resetting the printer to factory settings...  i'm running out of ideas!  it does not seem like this should happen, as all the auto-leveling does is figure out the z height of each probe pad and subtract the thickness of the washers.
here are some test prints, done in the center and each corner (printed right next to the probing pads).  i get the same results with s3d and cura.  thanks.




","i have a similar problem. in my case it's that the build plate isn't flat. as far as i can tell, the ""auto-level"" measures the corners correctly, based on the output from the probe printed on the console. the problem is that my plate has a saddle-shape (+x+y and -x-y are high, +x-y and -x+y are low) and as far as i can tell the firmware used by the taz6 just calculates an average x and y-slope. this essentially means in my case it ends up with close to a zero slope (because the two edges are sloped in different directions) that will be mostly correct at the edge midpoints, but not near the corners.

it appears more recent versions of marlin have the ability to do a ""mesh level"" that interpolates between the corner points (or even splits the build plate into a finer grid), see https://github.com/marlinfirmware/marli ... d-leveling. i don't know what the prospects of running that firmware on the taz6 are."

check your e-steps on your extruder- you might be over extruding filament- sounds complicated, is in fact very easy to fix- there is a how to do it on this website. (took me ten minutes to do, oh you'll need a felt tip marker for that one)
recheck your stl file by going to netfabb online service (there is a free version of it without having to download anything- search for it on these forums- my old messages about it have an exact link to it directly)
sometimes when you move a file from cura to the printer- some of the information is lost or just not there- netfabb is able to replace it and correct small mistakes- useful tool.
check that the profile for the material your using is correct- look correct by the photo's- how ever you might have to tweak the parameters slightly, the bed/extruder temperature a degree or two lower or higher.
if its a mechanical problem- don't touch it until you have spoken to the help line/email contact address at lulzbot, they where very useful for me when i first started."
taz 6 x belt rubs carriage,"hey guys, the x belt on my taz 6 rubs the carriage when the carriage is near the x=0 position. does anyone else have this problem ? the teeth of the belt rubs the belt clamp of the carriage.",thanks for the replies ! it does not look like it is the same problem as the mini but i did send an email to lulzbot support. the tech rep responded already and said that it looks like from my pictures that the belt is rubbing but that is normal based on all the printers that he has seen. he also said that it should not cause any issues. i'm quite disappointed that i spent so much money on a printer that has flaws like this but i guess it is what it is if all their printers are like this.
elephan foot issue,"taz6 using cura
i have it with pla, petg and abs got it better by reducing first layer temperature and flow rate but i got it to the limit. 
could it be a leveling problem?","yes.  most likely a dirty nozzle or disc contact points causing the auto-level to miscalculate.  the autolevel system is based on electircal continuity, so any plastic on the nozzle / discs will cause problems.  heat up the nozzle, clean it off with a paper towel.  scrape off any plastic on the discs.  replace or flip the wiper."

you should get a lot more experience using the machine before making big mods to it.

new taz 6 - layer change problems,"hi all!

i upgraded from a mini to a taz 6 at christmas and i'm trying to dial things in.  i'm finding that my layer changes are leaving a significant seam, and on most prints there are blobs as the layer starts.  

i use the latest cura build, and i'm working with matter hacks 3.0mm pla and i've changed a bunch of settings in my attempts to fix things.  i've lowered the print temp, i've enabled retraction at layer change, i've enabled coasting, i've moderated speeds so they're consistent, i've started the layers on the inside wall.  

i'm happy to give more info, i've also attached a photo of one piece with no blobs, but a very pronounced seam.  there's another photo of 2 unfinished rings that have the seam, then seemingly random blobs that start half an inch from the seam, and finally i have a txt export of my files that i cleaned up for readibility, in case it helps. 

i'd appreciate any advice you guys can give.","i would suggest looking into linear advance which helps with the flow of filament especially at the stop and start of a line.  there is a testing tool that marlin has but the trick with the taz is getting the bed leveling commands into the file.  when i still had the rambo board in mine i would just copy the startup from simplify3d into the gcode for the test.

here is the the link for the test patterns....

cannot level bed- left side too high,hi i am having some trouble leveling my taz 6 print bed. the left side of the bed is waaaay to high compared to the right. i moved my extruder at z +000.6 so that the left end can allow a piece of paper to move with a little resistance but the right side is wide open- i've tried to put some paper under the bed to make them higher but then the washers become tilted. has anyone encountered this before and could offer me some advice?  ,"mwester wrote: ?mon feb 25, 2019 7:58 pm

then i move the head to the right side of the bed (using the standard controls in the software), and turn the printer off.  make sure the printer is turned off, then slowly rotate the right lead-screw until the nozzle just touches the same cube moved to the right side of the bed. 


thanks for the reply!
may i ask which right lead screw should i rotate? the one on the bed?


here's a guide that might be helpful: https://ohai.lulzbot.com/project/leveli ... e-repairs/  -- they level with respect to the top frame of the printer; the most helpful advice i found was to level with respect to the bed (since that's what matters in the end).  so the general idea is the same, but the specifics of where and how you measure are a bit different in my suggestion.

the lead screw to rotate is the vertical threaded rod on the far right-hand side of the printer -- the one attached to the right-hand side motor.  just grasp the threaded rod, and gently rotate it by hand, and you'll see the right-hand side of the x-axis carriage (the rods that the head is mounted to) move vertically.  adjust until the clearance to the bed on that side matches what you set on the left side.  then power it back up, and your x-axis rods are now parallel to the bed.

and once again, don't worry about a millimeter or two difference -- the auto-leveling feature will probe the corner washers to determine that difference, and then it'll compensate for it each time you start a print.

(and remove any shims you've placed under the bed -- you don't want nor need those... and when you re-tighten the washers, use care -- i squeeze the glass to the base with forefinger and thumb so that i can snug up the screw in each corner; you don't want to use the screw to compress the rubber mount since it's just aluminum, and you'll risk stripping the threads.  also, it just has to be snug enough that the washer remains level when you stop squeezing -- you shouldn't be able to rotate the washer by hand.  any tighter, and you'll risk stripping the threads.)


wow i did not know those rods can be rotated- i think that might have fixed the issue for me. i did some adjustment and now both sides are perfectly level!

thank you very much for helping! you guys are awesome  "

okay, we have gone from the 1.0.0 branch of marlin to the 1.1.9 branch, and as such the software program is not recognizing your installed firmware. follow these directions to get the updated firmware onto your machine.

1.) preferences > configure cura > allow connections to wrong machine

this is not the way these should be made,inspecting parts these are the ‘y’ travel rail ends that the rods fit into.... these should be metal not printed parts with a allen screw tightening !!!... they are supposed to be in a real bushing or a true hole press fitted not a plastic hole i noticed my ‘y’ travel is stiff ... we measured the distance between the rails and there is about a 1/2 mm difference.... do ya think is because of a sloppy hole plus the allen screw tightening from one side and is pushing the rail as it tightens to a loose plastic hole changing the distance between the two rails enough to make it a tight travel...yep happens every time... these are very important parts for accuracy and smooth travel somebody please inform the engineers but i’m sure they must know plus a real metal part would cost a little more.... but so what makes for a better product!,very possible but i haven’t given up yet i still have faith i’ll know more in a few days on what i can live with... i have an excellent old school machinest that helps me when needed and am having him look a few things over ...  i have had him help me make several special fixtures for my cnc mills and other things ... i took a video on my phone today from the shop but can’t post says it’s too large it’s only minute how can i post it i really want to share it you should find it interesting thanks
dial indicator,"i know the taz can print great right out of the box..however i see several of us are noticing the 'z' axis can be off and are trying set it...i'm one of them!
coming from a cnc background where measurements are critical and things must be flat and level we use digital calipers and 'dial indicators' a lot..so what's a dial indicator?
 well for those of you that might not know it is a instrument that when at attached to the traveling head can check the surfaces for 'flatness' ..first you lower it to the surface then turn the dial to '0' then jog the head over to the other side while you watch the needle go up or down checking for flatness and how much it's off..okay got it?
 well my right side is off so here's where i'm at so far
  stripped the bed down including the wiper (notice the wires to the base plate are all tight against the frame and hole..hope they never short out!)
 went to menards and picked up a 4' piece of alum u-channel cut it down to make some supports for the glass bed then ran my dial indicator from front left to front right...
 my left is 'dialed' to '0' in the picture, jogged to the right notice the gap jogged it to the back right it's off so i'm thinking the 'z' rod needs a turn or two to bring it down..not sure i i have to turn off something or turn of the machine and turn by hand ..i don't want both spindles turning on me any help let me know or it's time for a call","to adjust the leadscrew manually, with the machine off and unplugged from power and usb, unplug the motor harness from the motor, then manually turn the motor. the easiest way to get consistency on both sides is to measure with calipers from the bottom of the leadscrew nut down to the top if the lower leadscrew bearing. that number should be identical on both sides. 

using a heavy clamp like that to mount the indicator has the potential to flex the rods down in the center which msy lead you to believe you have a slight hump in the middle of the bed. that's less present in the taz 6 with the 12mm x rods,  but they are still unsupported."
rod tilt?,after doing all i could no matter how much i shim the right front up it always comes back the same ...lower then the others! i'm thinking the smooth travel rod is tilted down a little..also one foot on the 'y' travel carriage (the right front foot)  does not even touch the floor (table top) by apx 1.5mm why is that? if everything is all the same that foot should be down..support says it doesn't matter but everything matters why is it so much higher then the others? something is not right!  ..i took all my previous shims off and started a bed level from scratch and here i sit......i'm going to my machinest to see what we can,"the feet aren't low enough to touch. the explanation i got when i asked about it was that it is a feature designed to let the taz  sit on a non level surface and that they are more just outriggers to prevent tipping. the issue is present on the 5 as well. to fix it, you can add washers under the flex feet with a longer m3 bolt to hold it in place. 

the extrusion are 20mm wide, the distance from the extrusion to the table should be 20mm plus width of the feet on the main frame, but it ends up being 19mm plus feet width for some reason."

you can just edit the line with g29 in start script. make it g29 v4; then watch the output in terminal. it will show you the height it measures for each corner"
well it's my turn chasing the dog 'z' bed level,"okay sit back and let me tell you my story
  coming from deskltop cnc and being a jeweler this is my first printer quite happy right now.
   call me a fanatic but i really like my machines 'level as you follow the pictures i'll try and explain
 printer was off level to the work table shots  before and after bubble level... i had to use that many shims on the left side to get it there then i added shims to help stabilize for vibrations around the printer...finally i took some angle iron and made two angles to lock the printer to the wall printer solid and level!...
 now the table ran the g28 g29 code checked my 'z' and discovered front left washer apx .5mm higher ..couldn't get it down so i had to raise the others...
  one thing i noticed was the washers are cocked creating and 'z' difference that not flat to the table (screws are not tight for some pics) anyway when i press my finger to the loose washer making contact with the glass you will see a gap underneath the washer so the washer will not tighten flat tightens at an angle look closely...
 i made the appropriate shims for each corner from a 'feeler' gauge i had and put them in the corners of the rubber pad (which i don't care for)  then took the right size shim and put it under the gap from the washer...as i was doing all of this i noticed the screws where not going in too smooth after closer inspection i noticed the holes were slightly off after still further inspection i noticed pad hitting the the glass bed and 'squishing' that was why the holes didn't line up ..well upon further inspection i noticed the rubber printed pad needed to be trimmed a little where the glass rests in the cutout also the curved corner should be flat to fit better which i done did  (see pics) a little more tweeking and got my 'z' to within apx.15mm...i see the pics are out of order","how are you assuring the horizontal bars are level in respect to the build plate?  perhaps the difference in measurement you’re seeing from left to right is a slight slope?  it is possible for each z motor’s carriage assembly (forgive me if i’ve gotten the terminology of the parts incorrect) to be at different heights.  one of mine cracked after a few months of use and i returned it for warranty repair.  i didn’t know that at the time, it’s what the techs found.

have you also checked the squareness of the frame?
https://www.lulzbot.com/sites/default/f ... lletin.pdf
i realize your printer is new and that service bulletin shouldn’t apply as your serial numbers shouldn’t fall within that range, however it won’t hurt to check and perhaps may prompt for a 2nd service bulletin in regards to squareness of the frame."
a little worried right now,well after a lot of reasearch i finally bought a printer ( i’m a cnc guy) already having an issue with open gl on my graphics card... however after looking at the forum i seem to be seeing lots of other issues.... did i make a big mistake i think i can still take it back if i keep it will i be working on this thing for hours on end to get decent prints.... i thought this printer was good out of the box?,"3d printing in general isn't as developed of a technology as cnc machining is. i also jumped in with a background in cad design, machining, and injection molding of plastics. there are limitations of 3d ffd printing that are completely different than the rules-of-thumb for injection molding. i think if you are going to do it at all, the lulzbot is a good choice. it will work right out of the box, if you start with the standard benchmark objects. i strongly suggest that.

where it gets more difficult is when you start using the printer for more random stuff. it really helps if you are designing what you are printing so you can keep the limitations of the process in mind and design around them.

you'll need to download the cura lulzbot edition so you can maintain the firmware on the printer, if for no other reason. i use (paid for) simplify3d now, since i like the interface better. i think you can adjust the same stuff in both softwares, but i find the interface more intuitive in s3d. i don't think i'm alone with that.

what i've learned recently is to have a standardized, simple, 'calibration' object you can print to test settings for changes of filament, after maintenance, and changing slicer software. i modeled something similar to a checker game piece, or maybe a poker chip. just a round disk 1"" in diameter and .25"" high. it prints fast (as 3d printing goes-it's a slow process).

if you make any changes to the machine, the most important setting you will have to optimize is the probe z-offset. i just went through that myself. the poker chip thing was invaluable in that process.

after optimizing with the chip, i printed the biggest thing i've ever done in the taz. it's a toolrest for my bench grinder. i always hated the one it came with. i was very heartened that it came out perfectly the first time. it took pretty much a day and half the night, so i was glad i had worked out the problems with the chips.

sorry to have rambled, but i guess my message is 'stay positive, but prepare to work for the success you can achieve'.

longer cables from control box,does anyone know where i could get longer cables from the box to the printer so i can remove the control box from the frame and mount it somewhere else? a 10 foot or so harness would be ideal.,"if you'd like to build your own longer harness, use the source files for your printer found here: http://download.lulzbot.com/. the connectors and pins we use are common and easy to build. the crimpers needed can be found online rather inexpensively."
recommended spare parts,"hi everyone,

i am fairly new to the world of 3d printing. started out by purchasing a taz 6.

since i don't have a second printer, it would be nice to print out the most commonly worn out parts ahead of time. does anyone have any recommendations of spare parts that wear out over time that i should print out and have on hand?","any other tips on getting the best results when printing these? i had assumed you'd use ""high-quality/high detail"", i downloaded the files for the small and large herringbone gears and printed them in hips (because that's what we have available currently) using the high detail.  i figured this will get us by for a while if we have a problem.

i'll eventually get some abs (or whatever other filament is most recommended for these parts) and reprint them. when i do, i want to make sure i'm using the best settings. when i looked at the g-code posted for these parts (same folder as the stl files), i noticed comments about a layer thickness of 0.3 and 65% or 74% infill (depending on which part you look at). there may be other tweaks to settings that i did not pick up on. i did not use that gcode for my printing, since it seems to be aimed at a different filament than i was using. 

so what is the best layer thickness to use on these gears? is there a better quickprint setting to use as a starting point than ""high detail"" when setting this up? are there other tweaks to make to those basic settings beyond layer thickness and infill %?"
"taz 5 ""z"" scaling issue","not only do i have an excessive ""y"" scaling (125%), but i also have a ""z"" scaling issue (65%). only the ""x"" value is correct on my prints. 

i tried re-flashing the firmware from an ancient version, but with only the dual extruder available, it reverses the extrude - so extrude retracts and retract extrudes. i also tried an earlier firmware for dual extrusion along with the last 3 releases. no change.

i'm left with only 1 solution; scale the model by 84% in ""y"" and 162% in ""z"".

this really sucks!!!

i have spent over 100 hours trying everything from software, firmware, to hardware - i've replaced the rambo, the lcd, the bed bearings, the ""y"" stepper motor, the ""y"" stop switch, along with using an old version of cura (15), newer versions of cura (3.2.23 & 3.2.32), and simplify 3d (last year's version and this year's version) all without any success.

i contacted lulzbot to try and get all new internal controller wiring harnesses, but they said they didn't have them. 
i can't imagine anything else that may affect this y and z scaling issue....

is there someone out there that has encountered this, and if so, discovered a solution they would be willing to share with me?

kind regards,
randy","go into your console and type m501 . that should return a bunch of lines of text in the console. look for and find the one that looks like ""echo: m92 x__ y__ z___ e__."" . for a taz 5 they should be x100.50 y100.50 z1600.00  and then something different for e. if those numbers are correct its not firmware. you've replaced most of the things that it would be if it isn't firmware though.  if those numbers are correct, and you print one of the models preloaded on the sd card to the printer without it connected to the computer and it still scales incorrectly, either your rambo is bad, ( a short to the motor controller chip for that axis, or a failed mosfet) or the harness / motor / mechanicals are bad. z scaling on both motors would indicate that you have the wrong z axis value, probably the threaded rod value from the taz 3 or earlier which is different than the taz 4-6. 

with the printer online, move the bed with the lcd. then try and push it lightly with your fingers. it should be difficult to move. if it moves easily, your y axis motor is not fully powered (one of the 2 coils may not be getting power) or has a coil reversed in polarity. if you hear a thumping sound it may be a belt too loose. 

if you want to source the wiring harnesses, itworks3d.com or building your own are the only two routes available. some of the ones from itworks aren't available  as well.

https://itworks3d.com/product/lulzbot-t ... l-harness/
https://itworks3d.com/product/lulzbot-t ... l-harness/

the taz rambo board is a fairly simple device at the heart of it. if it is functioning properly and you tell the y axis to move 10mm, and y steps is set to 100.5 steps per unit, its going to move 1005 steps and then stop. no more, no less. if the mosfet or the controller chip for the y axis is damaged it can apply more or less voltage than you sent and move it more or less steps. if the harness is damaged and only half of the motor coils are engaged it is possible that it will move less than 100%. if one coil is reversed it will either not move at all, or move double the expected amount. 

its not your power supply, the lcd would be behaving oddly or all of the axis would be having issues. its probably not the lcd, they usually fail to graphics issues, it plays no role in control movements once the file is handed to the rambo board. 

where did you source the rambo replacement from? was it a used one?  any chance it got shocked when it was installed or has a screw sitting behind it, or a heat sink fell off and is shorting to the board? what you are describing still would indicate a failed rambo to me if it is also printing incorrectly from the sd card. download some gcode from download.lulzbot.com if you don't have the original files anymore, don't use one you sliced with your slicer software as it could also be the issue here.

if it were me, i'd take the control box apart, check it for metal debris or anything that might be causing a short, then reassemble it step by step using the ohai diagrams, and if that doesn't work, then replace the board again."
taz5 underextruding by half,my taz suddenly started underextruding.  no hardware or software changes. i measured the extrusion rate and it is half what it should be.  all other axis are ok.  i changed esteps/mm to 1666 (twice what it was previously) and it works correctly now. so it sounds like it mysteriously decided to go to 1/16 steps instead of 1/8 steps.  does anybody know why that would happen?  i thought the rate was hardwired into the rambo board.,i tested again and once it extruded 65% of the requested distance and another time it extruded 55% of the required distance.  i will check for loose wiring although not sure how since it is intermittent apparently.  i tried an alternate extruder head with similar results so it is not the extruder head itself.

taz 5 with unusual problem.  need help,"i have a taz 5 with an e3d titan aero pro tool head.  a few days a go i had an issue with thermal runaway, but resolved it with a replacement thermistor.  now there is another problem.  when i print a part, the first 30 minutes have no problem.  however, after around half an hour, the filament starts slowing down then stops coming out of the nozzle.  ive tried multiple filaments, different temperatures, and adjusted the blower fan, but nothing works.  the extruder motor continues to rotate, so it is not that.  i even have a second backup aero too head, but did the same thing.  what could be causing this?","if you are printing pla at low extrusion rates, you could be having some heat creep induced jams. reducing retraction to the minimum necessary, increasing layer thickness or print speed to increase flow rate, cooling the room and adding larger hotend cooling fans are all things that can reduce the heat creep problem.

also, installing the heat brake into the heatsink while the heatsink is hot can help increase contact between the two parts, improving heat dissipation."
problem with replacement single extruder toolhead,"i bought a replacement toolhead on amazon after a user error caused the hot end and quite a bit higher to be encased in a huge blob of nylon.

i noticed right off the bat the left and right fan ducts on the new toolhead were not mirror images of each other. i chalked it up to some engineering optimization, and installed the toolhead.

what i didn't notice at first is the left fan duct hung lower than the nozzle. the right fan duct didn't. that caused the left duct to crash on the bed. the poor machine was still struggling to print as i aborted it.

since it was obvious what was wrong after a good look, i decided to swap out the left fan duct with my old one. even though that old duct was partially melted, it solved the problem. it's printing fine right now as i type this.

i urge people to be aware and critical when looking and lulzbot oem replacements and upgrades. i don't think my problem was a design flaw since i can't imagine they would ever have designed the ducts this way. i believe it is a manufacturing/qa problem. i believe somebody just assembled the toolhead with the wrong part.

taz 6 print size,"i haven't as yet purchased a printer but i'm considering the taz 6. i have a model that i think should fit the print limits for this machine but appears not to using cura. i'm knew at this so maybe i'm missing something. i have the stl file attached.  the dimension are - w - 10.750, h - 5.1and l - 4.26.

thanks for any help with this!!
   peter","the usable print dimensions i believe are 280mm x 280mm for length and width and 250mm for height so that would be 11.02"" x 11.02"" and 9.8"" tall.  that should be right on the website for the specs of the printer.

you can change the orientation a part is being printed to make it fit the bed..like take that part and angle it 45 degrees so it's diagonal on the bed.

most things in 3d printing are in metric so get used to using a conversion calculator."
ngen removal from taz6,"hello,

i wanted to post a noted which may help newbies to pei and ngen, like me.  

before i bought my taz6, i was using delta printers with glass or blue tape.  i printed pla/abs/tpu and never had any problems with the removal. 

i love my taz6.  the auto level is flawless.  the materials stick great!  but i have had issues getting the ngen to release.  ngen is now my favorite printing material.  i use glue stick and let the bed cool fully.  i have tweaked my z offset so it is actually almost too high and still was having issues with it releasing.     i really had to work at removing the print.  i printed the large gear for the extruder and it literally took my half a day to work it off without damaging the bed!

after reviewing the forums and youtube, i tried tapping the print, different tools, isopropyl alcohol.  i still struggled.  then, i ran across of post about using a mix of water and 70% alcohol.  i let the bed cool to 50 degrees celsius and spray the print.  come back in 10 minutes and the print is completely loose from the bed.  no tools, no taping.  i am amazed.  i have adjusted my z height down further for a smoother bottom and it still works great. 

this may be common knowledge but i thought i'd pass it along and hope it helps someone.
 
patrick","i print with ngen all of the time and i use avery brand glue stick on the print bed. i wait until the bed cools almost all the way down and the parts come off with very little struggle. i agree i really love ngen too, prints like a dream even very fine detail objects."
"taz 5 ""y"" scaling issue","hello all,

i have been working hard trying to ""fix"" the ""y"" scaling issue i'm having with my taz 5. 
when i print a 1"" x 1"" x 1"" cube it comes-out as x=1.0, y=1.26, z=0.72

at first i only had issues with y, now i'm also having issues with z.

a bit of history:
i acquired a well-used taz 5 from a service bureau. at first it worked relatively well, then all of a sudden, the ""y"" scaling issue appeared, then the lcd went out. so in a very systematic approach i replaced the following items:

rambo board
lcd display
""y"" axis bearings and blocks (all 4 of them)
""y"" stepper motor
""y"" stop switch
extruder - upgraded to the dual extruder v3
updated cura to 3.2.32 and re-flashed the rambo
acquired, installed, and used simplify3d

no difference in solving the ""y"" axis scaling with any of the aforementioned changes.

the help desk at aleph objects as a group are stumped. they suggested i reach-out the the form.


so, has anyone encountered these issues? aside from replacing the remaining harnesses, there is nothing more i can do.....

kind regards,
randy","the ""y"" scaling issue cropped-up late last year. my immediate work-around was to create 1"" cube and measure the x,y,z and scale the stl file. this did produce desired results, but why have to do that?

perhaps i wasn't clear in mentioning that the rambo was replaced about a month ago, along with the lcd panel. yesterday i replaced the ""y"" stepper motor and limit switch along with all 4 bed bearings and bearing housings.

i did check the steps/mm and they are correct: x=100.5, y=100.5, z=1600.

the ""z"" axis scaling may be a different issue; as it has just recently occurred - i'm thinking it may be adjusted in the cura configuration file (hopefully).

continuity tests positive on all harness wires.

i am still perplexed  what else can i possibly do to affect this ""y"" scaling?

taz 5 and upgrades from aliexpress?,"hello to all,
recently i joined to the 3d printing world and i already tried a couple of printer before ordering the taz 5.

i started with a anycubic i3 mega, then i switched to a flashforge creator pro (2016 model) but recently i've found a pretty good deal (i think) for a lulzbot taz 5 on amazon.uk that was going for around 743£ brand new and i decided to buy it immediately since i saw a lot of positive feedback for this printer and a lot of good reviews for the newer model taz 6.
after that i started to get as much as info as possible before receiving my printer (it should arrive in a couple of days).
unfortunately i saw a lot of unsatisfied taz 5 owners around the web and i started to think that maybe i won't get an improvement from the creator pro (other than the print volume) in terms of print quality.

for that reason i started looking for what upgrades i can do to get the best results possible with this printer.

while i was looking for some x axis and z axis upgrades (here) i found that some aluminuim replacement can be bought from aliexpress:

z axis
x axis

unfortunately i did not find any review for those item, does anyone know if they worth buying or it's better to stick with abs printed upgrades?

before buying the taz 5 but there was only 1 avaiable printer at that price.. 
thank you for the answer, i was looking at your great improvements, and they are very well explained, you made a great work! 
unfortuntely i find very difficult to find the right parts over a lot of different websites and some are discontinued. i really would like to find everything in the same place or someone that sell complete upgrades. (is there someone?)
i find quite hard to believe that such range of printers need all those upgrades to get some properly printed pieces. i haven't tried the printer yet but at the moment i'm quite undecided whether to hold or return the printer as soon as i receive it.
i really hope i'm wrong but reading some posts here and some other articles on the web seems that i spent more to get less quality from what i had before   
of course i have to blame me for not looking for that infos.. "
delamination,"so i've been battling initial layer squish on one our university's taz6 units.  i wet sanded the bed and prepped it as instructed by a lulzbot tech support person.  i reset my z offset the other day and did a few test prints- and.... they were stinking fantastic!!  so excited to have those first layers have squish and adhere well.  

so then last night i ran a three piece print (where each piece was larger than my initial test pieces) and i ended up in delamination on all three pieces.  one of them worse than the others, but all of them had it. wish i'd have thought to take pictures but i didn't. 

my question is - now that i have my z offset dialed in and i like that first layer squish - what do i have to adjust to get my lamination issue dealt with?  is this an e-step issue?  is this and extrustion percentage issue or rate issue?  i have no idea.  and i am frustrated because i have students waiting to print.

thanks for any help or input.

homing g28 z0 not working: why are all axes are homing???,"my lulzbot taz 5 is doing weird things. i first noticed it while using octoprint, but it turns out it is not related to octoprint or cura or univesral gcod sender, because they all exhibit the same problem:

when i try to home just the z axis, the x & y axis homes too. 
the command is g28 z0

g28 x0 y0 will work, and just homes the x & y. but i can't home the z all by it's self. which is what i need to do for bed leveling.

is there a setting in marlin firmware that is messing with this perhaps? maybe it is looking for a sensor or some auto leveling feature??

any help appreciated","while it doesn't seem like you're new, i always jump back to https://www.simplify3d.com/support/arti ... -tutorial/ for commands.

i've got the taz 6, but my working code omits the z axis because it messes up the bed leveling. however, i used to use a separate g28 z at some point i remember i think (it's different now that i mostly use the v3 head which makes things odd) and i think it was throwing off the autoleveling settings.

see if you can run the code without the attached ""0"" just a g28 z, that might be a better thing? are you just coding an empty print with a g28 z and then a simple g1 x100 y100 z5 ? (i always like to lift z a bit in move commands)"

dual extruder v3 used as single extruder,"not everything i want to print need two extruders. i have used it as a single extruder a few times and have not been able to keep extruder 2 off. should i just leave extruder 2 on and hot or should i just set the temp to zero? basically, what is the best way to set this up as a single extruder and is there an issue with doing this?","hmm... the two toolheads should be swappable.  you'll have to flash the firmware on the printer each time.

as for getting the nozzles level, comparing the extrusion thickness of a calibration pattern works best for me on the taz 5.  lock in the initial nozzle height then adjust the second (t1/e2) nozzle height by turning the right-side lead screw (an eighth or quarter turn at a time).  each time the lead screw is adjusted print the t1 pattern for comparison with the t0 pattern extrusion width.  

not super scientific, but faster than the lb recommended method to loosen the heat sink and adjust."
v3 dual head extruder wiring problem on taz 5,"i recently purchased a v3 dual extruder for my early model taz 5 with a 0.35mm nozzle.

when i went to install the head i noticed that the original wire harness with 4 separate connectors would not fit the v3 e2 wire harness.

i called support and the person i spoke to recommended getting an updated wire harness (v2c). the new harness arrived and it appears the pinout does not match the e2 pinout.

i've tried searching the internet for the wiring diagram to see if i need to rearrange the pins with no success.

i've attached a photo of the mismatched harness connectors.

it seems like the six wires on the left are correct, but i'm not sure about the other five (six on the supply side) and i'm not confident the wires of the new harness are correct at the main connection.

can anyone help me with this?","thanks kmanley57 - 

i got the similar input (without the wire diagram) from the lulzbot tech support people and was able to complete the demo print.

but i didn't get the advice to check the second extruder fan wires in the control box and i didn't notice fan 2 running....

in the menu i see an option to control fan speed 1 but not fan speed 2. and when i turn up fan speed 1, only fan 1 runs as i would expect.

from the diagram you provided, it shows pin 7 and 8 as the extruder fan - these wires are not connected at the extruder harness connection point for e2. it appears that the fan wires for e2 run across the extruders to the connector for e1.

it also appears that there is a 1 for 1 wire for every connection in the control box. any suggestions for how to control the fan for e2? 

thanks again.

replacement nozzles for taz4 budaschnozzle,"i own a taz4 with a budaschnozzle hot end.  i've never replaced the nozzle, and i suspect it's now in need of replacing.  i contacted lulbot's tech support and they were pretty much worthless (was told to go buy a completely new hotend, which will also require a new connector kit, and make my other hot end (a flexystruder) unusable).  i was wondering if anyone here:
1) knows of a replacement nozzle i can use which will fit my budaschnozzle hot end (e3d and swiss micro come to mind, and i'll contact them as well)
2) have instructions for removing and replacing the nozzle.  if it's just a matter of using two wrenches to remove and then install a nozzle, no problem, but i seem to recall the the hot end needs to be heated up before removing and installing.

thanks,

jeff","one of our re-sellers itworks3d has a good selection of parts available for our older printers.

here is a link to their taz 4/5 parts page:
https://itworks3d.com/product-category/ ... 4-5-parts/

here is a link to their nozzles page where they have buda style nozzles at the bottom.
https://itworks3d.com/product-category/parts/nozzles/

we do not recommend replacing nozzles as the procedure can cause damage to the rest of the hot end, over tightening is very easy to do and will strip the threads on the hot end. if you do want to proceed with the nozzle change i can provide advice, but be aware:

to swap a nozzle you will want to heat the hot end to 185c from cold. please do not cool it down to 185c as it will not work the same. then once you reach 185c please turn off the power on the printer. 

then you will need an 18mm open end wrench to hold the hot end with, while you use a 7mm open end wrench to remove the nozzle. (please be careful of the small thermistor wires) if the tool head is mounted on the printer you will be turning the 7mm wrench to the left. then you can screw the nozzle off. 

you will be able to put the nozzle back on as long as the hot end is still warm. please don't over tighten the nozzle as it is torqued to 30 in. lbs. (just over snug)

i realize this is an old thread sorry.

that geetech gt2560 has a 8 bit processor running at 16 mhz the archim has 32 bit running at 86 mhz. its not really comparable . on large complex prints with high detail the 8 bit chips buffer runs out and causes the printer to slow down giving you a bad consistency in the print. i can send you a gcode where this is very obvious. the board you suggest is very nice if you wanna mess with drivers and so on but drivers aren't the biggest problem in these boards unless noise is your biggest concern.

taz 5 dual extruder 3 issue,"i have a taz 5 with the dual extruder v3 head.  prior to now the head had been working flawlessly on either extruder or both.

i am running he 1.1.5.71 firmware, cura 2.6.69, but using octoprint.  my head appears to be one made just after the thermistor problem sn kt-cp0127-0494, so i wonder maybe it slipped?

what causes this error?","i have a 6 and if any connections expected at boot are not there, it will halt with a related error, so probably. time to break out a multimeter. fwiw, i was one of the early v3 dual thermistor connection failure victims last year, i resolved it by soldering all the thermistor related connectors on the print head end and never looked back.

this part says it does not fit the v3 dual, but it is physically very similar in construction to the dual's sensors:

help with print quality,"relatively new user - and definitely new to the forum - so i apologize if this is something that should be in a preset heading somewhere else.

since we just got back after holiday break, i remembered that right before break a student had this result on a personal print.  and part of the issue seems to be the head not pulling filament off the spool very well.  although, yesterday when i purposefully ""unspooled"" quite a bit of filament it did not help.

i've attached some pics - hoping for some feedback.

thanks!","many thanks!  i did the cold pull process on friday before i left work.  actually did it on both of our t6 machines and then sanded both beds with crocus cloth (as was suggested by a lulzbot tech prior to summer).  i also moved the roll of filament on a temporary bar so its on top of the frame.

ran a test print on the machine that the original post's pictures were from and its looking good.  so fingers crossed, i think its ready to go. 

my plan is to print a couple of the a frame filament holders for both machines and move the rolls up top.  if i can get the department head to shoot for the dual extruder, i'd like to have both up top eventually.

taz5 dual v3 loose nozzle,"i have a taz5 with a dual v3 head, and had a nasty clog on e2. now i have a loose nozzle. see video for detail. not sure what to do... 
as with previous hex hot ends, i disassembled this one by unscrewing the nozzle. while it was out, i noticed the heat block (?) was loose. any suggestions?

the two set screws that hold the hot end into the large heat sink are tight, and the tubular metal shaft running down into the heat block is not wobbling or rotating when the end moves. only the end with the thermistor/nozzle is moving. 

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vsjo9e ... sp=sharing","cold pulls are really hard to do with the gears and curved filament path of the dual v3 extruder body.  

you can possibly do it as the nozzle cools down.  try this:
- heat up extruder to normal filament extrusion temp
- turn off extruder or set temp to 0c
- when hotend temp cools to filaments min-temp, start retracting filament using the large gear.

this should allow a ""cold pull"".  the min-temp would depend on the filament type.  for abs, maybe 210-220c?  basically, the filament should be semi-solid in the nozzle and pop off.  a successful cold pull would create a cone shaped filament end.

i did a quick test with a print that was already running. abs, high detail, some values tweaked like 2mm retraction to eliminate strings, concentric infill at 70% but the rest default.

i'm just stabbing at a start/stop button on stopwatch app, so not totally scientific but for one layer i get the following times...

50%: 2:54
100%: 1:49

and then for 200, 600, 700 and 800%, all ~1:35.

steve","for those of you who've wired directly into the on board power, can you clarify which terminals you landed on?  ran across something interesting during a recent upgrade session on my taz 4.  i upgraded to the v2 single extruder, and while i was inside the control box, i went ahead and decided to tie my led light strips into the onboard 24v power.  i tied into the main power supply input terminals and ran wires out through two of the spare terminal posts in the xz connector, and then up to a rocker switch, and finally to my lights.  i chose to tie into the topmost power, which in hindsight appears to have been a bad idea.  the lights work/look great, but my prints immediately went to garbage.  bad prints under really great light look 100x worse, btw.  my z-axis in particular seemed to go crazy, and couldn't keep track of steps.  20mm calibration cubes were coming out around 15.5mm tall.  x/y dimension seemed close, but were bulging due to the bulging from the compressed z layers.  i broke my cardinal rule and made multiple changes during one overhaul, making troubleshooting a challenge.  

didn't think the new extruder should really have any impact on z axis travel, so suspected the lights creating interference with the steppers.  in pulling up the rambo manual, i see that the power i tied into also feeds the logic and motors.  assume the leds or running the power wire in the same cable bundle as the other xz connector port wires are creating some sort of interference, because i pulled the two wires i landed back off, and ran some more calibration cubes and all is back to normal.

i've seen a couple references to auxiliary 24v power outs on the board, but i'm not sure on the exact locations/specs, or if the aux power out is turned on by default, and also not sure if it is 24v by default.  i see piercet's post in this thread referencing the main power supply, wondering if you chose the lower two terminals, which i think power the heated bed, or if you routed wires in a different fashion, avoiding the potential power/signal wire bundling i did?

looking for any thoughts from guys who've had success pulling 24v out of the control box to run leds?"
t-nuts for taz 6,the t-nuts that are used in the taz 6 have to be inserted into the slot from the end. i believe there are t-nuts that can be inserted into the slot in the middle of the rail and then turn when tightened to grip. does anyone know where i can source this second type of t-nut? what size is needed? how about a source and size for the original t-nuts?,"""similar"" to that ""https://www.amazon.com/ocr-t-nuts-nicke ... +nut&psc=1"" yes!  however, i can confirm those do not fit into the slots of the taz 6 frame.  they're too big to drop in.  they might slide in from the end, i don't know i didn't want to disassemble my frame end to find out.  those fit into a 2020 series aluminum frame.  these fit into my anet a2 3d printer (used as a laser engraver) and that of course is made from 2020 & 2040 aluminum pieces.  looks like the slot opening is ~5mm on the taz 6 and ~7mm on the anet a2.

i have mounted a spool holder on top of my taz 6 sometime last year, i think i got some nuts small enough too fit in there and fished the bolt into the threads through the spool holder base.  it was a real pita.  https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2805599

as an alternative here's a clever design to make your own t-nuts via 3d printing combined with a regular hex nut.

taz 4 alignment pieces,"hi all

trying to repair a taz4, however i don't have the following pieces to help with assembly:

pull my taz 4 out of storage,"i recently pulled my taz 4 out of storage after a couple years. cleaned it up nice and good, but i'm trying to figure out a couple things to get back into it:

1. are there any firmware updates i need to do since last using it in 4/2015?
2. can the stock nozzle print petg?
3. is the lulzbot edition of cura the way to go for slicing? if not what's a good alternative to look into?

thanks for any help","congrats on waking your baby up from its slumber!

for now, run some test prints, and refer to the maintenance info in your manual to make sure it's ship-shape.

your budaschnozzle should work well enough, but by upgrading that hot end and extruder to one of our newer tool heads and upgrading your pet film to the pei film, you'll have almost a taz 5. use the taz 5 profiles in cura le (version 3.2.23+), but you may need to tweak some temperatures until you move to the newer hot ends and print surface.

here's a link to the legacy versions of cura lulzbot edition: http://download.lulzbot.com/software/cura/packages/ version 21.08 should work well for your current setup."
g21 command unknown?,"i was looking at the serial.log (optionally) produced by octoprint and found this:

z-axis homing issues - lulzbot mini toolhead on taz 6,"i recently purchased a lulzbot mini 1 toolhead on the cheap, and i'm looking to set it up as my dedicated 3mm toolhead on my taz 6 (which is converted permanently to 1.75mm). i printed the new mounts, fan ducts, etc, and physically it's good to go. i moved the pins around the connector to match the taz 6, and it heats, extrudes, etc. from what i can tell it should be gravy.

it will not home the z axis correctly. normally, when it homes the z axis it will home the bed first, which then moves back about 1-2"" before the extruder is lowered onto the home switch. with my new extruder hooked up, the bed never moves back after homing and the z-axis lowers onto the corner leveling pad instead. it is making contact and it's seeing the connection since it does the quick down/tap/slow down/tap cycle like it does during leveling, but then just repeats this cycle over and over again. that's all i get, and it just loops at this point.

if i plug in my original extruder, everything works perfectly without issue.

anyone seen this before? any thoughts? it's really frustrating and doesn't make sense. thanks in advance.","the endstop wiring on the mini and taz 6 toolheads are different, my first thought on this is that most likely your x-max endstop is remaining triggered because of the difference in the wiring. if you haven't already i would try moving the wiring on the endstop on your toolhead.
here is how the endstop wiring will normally look on a mini toolhead: https://ohai.lulzbot.com/media/uploads/ ... x0_q85.jpg
here is how the endstop wiring will normally look on a taz 6 toolhead: https://ohai.lulzbot.com/media/uploads/ ... x0_q85.jpg
be sure to completely power off and unplug your printer before making adjustments to your wiring."
trying to connect using usb over ip,"i just successfully printed my first rocktopus using my laptop (windows 10) connected directly to the taz 6.  ideally, i'd like to use my desktop (also windows 10) to control the taz, which is located in another room.  i've successfully been using a device much like this...

https://smile.amazon.com/dp/b00akxovg6/ ... il_1?psc=1

...(mine's iogear, but i believe they're identical devices) to control both a vinyl plotter and a cnc machine (both g-code based) ""remotely"", and was hoping to do the same with the taz.  unfortunately, cura doesn't seem to want to connect.  after establishing the connection through my usb server software, two usb serial devices pop up in device manager (one on com4 and the other on com5 - on the direct connection to the laptop, only one usb serial device shows up on com5).  one of these devices (com4) has an error code, stating ""this device cannot start.  (code 10)"".  after manually directing the computer to apply the rambo driver to both devices, they both show up as ""3d printer powered by rambo"" (i had to perform the same procedure on the laptop), however the device on com4 still has the error code.

within cura, in the monitor settings, after clicking the connect button under manual control, the message at the top of the scrollable area under usb printing reads ""connecting"", but stays that way indefinitely (clicking disconnect changes the message to ""connection closed"").  i have attempted manually setting the com port within the cura machine settings to both com4 and com5, but neither produces any change in results.  i have also tried playing with the baud rate settings both in the device manager device properties port settings tab, and within cura, but that hasn't seemed to have any effect, either.

i realize my setup case is fairly niche, but i'm hoping someone will have some advice.  i know others have successfully used these usb servers to control their 3d printers (of other manufacture), so i'm holding out hope for the taz...","i was able to figure things out.

turns out the issue was the connection with the desktop (or possibly more accurately, some kind of hitch in cura), and was not a problem going through the usb server.  i brought the taz into the room with my desktop and attempted a direct connection, but was still having the same problem - cura would state ""connecting"" indefinitely, and not actually establish any connection.  i then added a second taz 6 to cura, and deleted the first one (which i'd added upon install).  i again manually set the com port (which was com6 for the direct connection), and this time was able to successfully connect.

encouraged, i moved the taz back into the room where i wish it to live, and plugged it back into the usb server.  to my relief and satisfaction, i was still able to establish a connection (still on com6, interestingly)."
taz 6 with aerostruder problems.,"hi,

finally finished  building my aerostruder toolhead for my taz 6 but i'm having problems with it blocking up after about 5 mins into a print. i've only used esun and polymaker pla filaments in 2.85 and 1.75 flavours so far with the same results. i have to disassemble the tool head to remove the blockage and start over. i've done the 'hot set' to make sure the nozzle is seated properly (e3d website guide) and checked everything is aligned with both 2.85 and 1.75 guide inserts.

i'm using simplify 3d and been playing around with the retraction settings as this seem to help but has not completely fixed the problem. maybe i should also double check the feed rate?

anyone have similar problems?","if you can, remove the software variable out of your troubleshooting by using the known-good profiles in cura lulzbot edition: https://lulzbot.com/cura. after a few test prints, try to determine where your filament gets stuck by marking the filament where it comes out of the idler, removing it, and holding it up at the same level to see where it's seizing. you'll also want to make sure that everything is aligned well along the entire filament path."
taz 6 igus bearing failure / wearing out,"i make a lot of use of my taz 6 printer for a multitude of projects at my makerspace, and at home.

( i use it at least as much, if not more than, james from x-robots uses his... and that's saying something )

after ~5000 hours of printing time, i was getting lots of wobble artifacts.   i could gently twist, and even lift, the build plate.  the corners would move almost 3 millimeters up, and 1-2 millimeters to the right and left.

after checking everything from z-axis alignment, frame alignment and squaring, and belt tightness... it occurred to me to check the igus bushings.   i never lubricate my axis, since igus bushings are self-lubricating and can actually be damaged by the application of oils or solvents.  i did regularly wipe down the rods with a clean microfiber cloth, to keep them clean and free of dust and skin oils.

i was >shocked< to find out how much the igus bushings had worn down.  the center channel was oval-ish, rather than round, on all four bushings.  compared to a new bushing, there was a 0.5-0.7 mm of wear along the vertical axis, and 0.2-0.4 mm of wear along the horizontal axis.

new bushings are available in the lulzbot store for $14 : https://www.lulzbot.com/store/parts/10m ... ushing-4pk

the igus bushings for the x axis also have worn, but not as badly.  again, they have worn much more in the vertical, than the horizontal ( 0.08-0.15 mm in the vertical, 0.02-0.07 in the horizontal ).    i have not replaced them yet.

put simply -- after about 2000 hours, you should >definitely< replace your igus bushings along the y axis to make sure you maintain the best possible quality prints.  this is the trade-off between using linear bearings, and the igus plastic bushings.  they wear down, even though they are self-lubricating.  even if you keep your steel rods very clean.






after replacing the bushings with new ones, and checking that the y-axis belt was correctly tensioned, the build plate was easy to maintain level and my prints have the straight sidewalls and crisp details i expect from the taz 6.","it is pretty easy to change the bearings on the bed. i can do it with the bed/carriage still on the machine though.   

lots of practice!"
rambo patch adding capacitor to z-min & zero sense,"i came across this today and was wondering what adding 100pf capacitors to the z-min and zero sense circuit does?

https://ohai.lulzbot.com/project/rambo_patch/",this guide was for a very old model of the rambo board (from the taz 1-2) that required these be added to allow it to work with our z-axis setup. as long as you aren't working on a board from 5+ years ago this won't apply and isn't anything to be worried about.  
new tool heads,"ok, with all these new tool heads i have a thousand questions and am quite shocked that i could not find a single thing in the forums about these. currently for toolhead i have two std taz 5 .35 heads, a flexdually v1 and a moarstruder but have not gotten around to buying a aerostruder. i don't have a std taz 5 .5 head but use the .5 head of the flexdually as if it was a single head. 

so having an unlimited supply of money but a limited amount of shelf space, what should i buy and what  should i through away. 

no seriously money is always an object. but it looks like the new aerostruder does away with the need for a flexstruder. i never bought a single flexstruder either, i've just always used the flexdually as a single.  the flexdually appears to be missing from the store tool heads page and the dual extruder v3 does not support flex and semi flex material. does this mean one can no longer print flex/semi with either non flex/semi material or support material? for example i've often made dice with abs eyes and squishy body and other such mixed items.  could there a flexdually v3 on it's way and just not out yet. 

i know my previous paragraph basically just rambles, so let me summarize my questions another way. if i wanted to print both flex/semi material and many standard filaments together as sell as o print two non flex/semi filaments together, how many heads ( and which ones ) would i need. i understand nozzle size and print quality can make this more complicated so to make this simple and help me understand the heads from a filaments option alone, lets just leave quality and print time out.

oh, and if i buy a hs+ is my moarstruder ready for the junk yard?

thanks
greg","there certainly isn't any buzz about these new tool heads like there was this time last year for the new tool heads of their time, the dual extruder v3 and the aerostruder.  i'll reserve my opinion as to why that is.  i do not understand why you say the dual extruder v3 does not support flex and semi flex material.  that is not true!  here's the link to the store for the v3 dual extruder - https://www.lulzbot.com/store/tool-head ... -tool-head ; if you scroll down to the ""features"" section and read question #2.
question 2: can the lulzbot taz dual extruder v3 tool head print flexible materials?

answer: yes, the dual extruder v3 is capable of printing flexible materials.

i have both the aerostruder & v3 dual extruder and i can tell you both tool heads can print flexible filament.  i don't have any semi-flex filament so i can't comment on that, though i can't imagine why they wouldn't be able to print semi-flex filament if they can print all other filaments.

the aerostruder works so well (must get the silicone soc!) i don't ever see a reason to go back to the stock ""standard"" print head.

you say you have the moar extruder tool head.  the new hs+ tool head claims to be able to print twice as fast as the moar tool head;  the large 1.2 mm nozzle diameter and massive heater block with elongated melting zone is paired with the e3d titan extruder to enable extrusion rates of up to approximately 205 grams/hour.  though i don't know why it would print twice as fast than the moar tool head when the parts are essentially the same except for a hardened steel nozzle and extruder hobb.  i'm still waiting to see someone do some real world tests to support or debunk this claim."
differences between lulzbot taz models 1 2 3 4 5 6,"we get asked this frequently so i figured a post would be helpful.
feel free to chime in with suggested adds/ changes/ corrections. we start with the features of the taz 1, and note changes/upgrades as they happen in later models.

additional details and many pictures available in the holp http://devel.lulzbot.com/holp/

taz 1-5 have the same bed size and print volume.

taz 1:
- budaschnozzle hotend up to 240c
- heated bed up to 110c
- pet bed plastic
- 12v 360w power supply with printed endcap
- no lcd or card reader, usb only (lcd cable, housing and panel can be added)
- printed y axis end plates, control box, and lulzbot dual color logo plate
- toolhead harness has 2 4 pin connectors- 4 pin connector for stepper with multicolored wires, 4 pin connector with 2 red wires for the hotend resistor and 2 orange wires for the hotend thermistor. 

taz 2:
- adds lcd with sd card reader for untethered / headless printing
- mid production- upgraded to 24v for faster heating, 24v 360w power supply, silver chassis with printed endcap
- acrylic laser etched logo plate
- metal control box
- survived the fall 2013 flooding of the manufacturing facility!

taz 3:
- printed z nut spring upgraded to a stiffer more durable design
- metal y axis endplates with printed bearing and motor mounts. front and back plate have different arches, are not interchangable, and can't be re-drilled to convert one to another.

taz 4:
- z axis lead screws increased in diameter with different thread pitch- which is why taz 3 firmware doesn't work correctly in a taz 4)
- z axis lead screws located by bearings at each end, adding additional bracing to the smooth rods. (taz 3 z rod is only located by the flexible coupler and z nut)
- metal x axis endplates
- larger diameter z nuts.
- new flexible aluminum z axis couplers between steppers and z lead screws
- new control box: cam lock connectors for all wires entering and leaving. two extruder connectors on the exterior of the box, making it easier to add a second extruder. wire exits moved to clear the new lower z axis motor mounts (a taz 3 control box only works with creative modification) lcd wire harness now externally removable for service 
- different wire harness routing
- z axis endstop moves from z motor mount to z carriage
- different wire harness routing
- filament cooling fan (optional on earlier taz models).
- 24v 450w power supply, sealed molded plastic
- toolhead harness adds 2 pin 24v pwm controlled wires for filament cooling fan
- several y axis motor mount side endplate holes shift 15mm from taz 3 endplate positions.
- y motor bracket changes slightly.
- bed frame to main frame connectors change to prevent bed lifting and shifting.
- minor changes to double bearing holder and single bearing holder
- lighter x carriage with dual extruder cable hold down
- larger diameter z endstop target bolt (m5 compared to taz 3 m3) and stiffer spring allow for much more accurate z height keeping and eliminates bed height adjustment keeping difficulty earlier taz models were prone to

taz 5:
- hexagon all metal hotend up to 300c
- .35mm nozzle in early production, .5mm nozzle in later production
- 3 versions of toolhead connectors through the production run: first: ""v2a"" 4pin + 4pin + 2pin + 2pin, second ""v2b"" 4pin + 4pin + 3pin + 2pin to avoid mixing up the 24v filament cooler fan and 5v micro blower fan connections. third through the end of production ""v2c"" 8x2 pin. lulzbot has a handy chart with adaptor part numbers for reference https://www.lulzbot.com/tool-head-adapters
- pei bed plastic. more durable, lower maintenance (no acetone!!), better adhesion.
- 24v 450w power supply, sealed molded plastic in early production, 500w higher quality metal enclosed power supply in later production.
- toolhead harness adds 2 wires supplying fixed 5v
https://www.lulzbot.com/store/parts/int ... arness-add
https://www.lulzbot.com/store/parts/ext ... arness-add
to the hotend heatsink ""microblower"" cooling fan
https://www.lulzbot.com/store/parts/micro-blower-55v

taz 6:
- hotend upgraded to ""v2.1"" which changes the heatsink cooling fan to a front mounted 5v with printed duct, adds a second filament cooler on the left side of the filament for more even cooling, and changes the toolhead carriage design.
- print volume reduced slightly in x and y to 11.06""
- ""auto bed leveling"" added, which compensates for the print bed being off from parallel with the x carriage and the y carriage not being perpendicular to the z axis. like the lulzbot mini, the taz 6 runs a calibration routine at the start of every print where the print nozzle makes electrical contact with washers at the corners of the bed.  the z height values are fed into the firmware, and the z axis runs up and down dynamically during the print to compensate. also new is a ""sanity check"" during the bed calibration that halts the calibration if a value is outside a reasonable range. this feature automatically halts calibration, wipes the nozzle in a different pattern, then re-starts the calibration.
- automatic nozzle cleaning wipes the nozzle on a replaceable pad prior to the auto bed level routine to help clean the nozzle and aid in good electrical contact during the bed calibration.
- x axis rods increase in size to 12mm
- all smooth rods and bearings are improved to an upgraded high accuracy system
- z lead screws changed to a different spec, are now (shiny silver) stainless steel, no lubrication. z nuts are interchangeable between taz 4/5/6
- new expanded metal control box housing consolidates power supply, rambo board, lcd panel w/control knob and 1 power switch along with an exhaust fan into a single unit.
- wiring is simplified and streamlined
- steppers are all black
- x carriage is moved in between the z smooth and threaded rods to reduce leverage
- ninjaflex washer is added between the x/z carriers and z drive nuts to reduce binding
- z home is now accomplished with a push button at the left rear of the bed
- z offset can be adjusted during the print from the lcd
- lcd text interface improved, with larger print in some sub menus and animated graphics for some operations.
- y front endplate changed to match the y rear endplate
- corner brackets upgraded to aluminum
- frame extrusions upgraded to locking t-slots
- travel maximum and minimum endstop switches on all 3 axis (prior tazs had only minimums)
- automatic temperature settings generated in cura, no need to pre-set temperatures
- x maximum and y maximum endstops added. y endstops are relocated from the frame to the bed itself. x maximum endstop installed on rear of x carriage right blower fan. wireing changed to match.
- change to mounting feet and rod mount on y bed corners using printed dampers
- fillament guide path spinner mounts can now fold up against frame with the spinner removed
- https://www.lulzbot.com/cura automatically controls temperature through the entire print process.

upgrading a prior taz to a taz 6 has a number of dependencies that limit piecemeal upgrades.  the mechanical parts you'll need are:
- 12mm x rods
- 12mm bearings
- control box
- aluminum bed plate
- y front endplate (same as taz 4/5 motor end plate)
- extruder heatsink cooler fan
- filament cooler fan
- a pile of heat inserts
- switches
- wire, pins, and connectors for the required re-wire
you'll need to print a bunch of parts as well. we sell many of them, and are working on a kit of parts based on some pre-production chassis from lulzbot

upgrading a taz 4 to a taz 5 is covered in another thread, but to recap:
- replace pet bed plastic with pei replace pet with pei on the bed https://www.lulzbot.com/store/parts/lul ... -pei-sheet
- upgrade the toolhead to the v2 hexagon
https://ohai.lulzbot.com/project/taz4-hexagon-toolhead/
https://www.lulzbot.com/store/tool-head ... ol-head-v2
with requires adding wires to the extruder harness
https://www.lulzbot.com/store/parts/int ... arness-add
https://www.lulzbot.com/store/parts/ext ... arness-add
- flash the firmware to taz 5

upgrading a taz 3 to taz 4/5 is far more involved.
if your want ""cool project, time and money aren't really an object, i like hunting down obscure parts and printing my own upgrade parts"" go ahead with a taz 3 to 4/5 upgrade
if you want a ""taz 4/5"", just buy one ready to go.  you'll likely be money ahead (control box connectors are around $30 ea, for example), and will save a bunch of time.
- perform the upgrades in taz 4 to taz 5 above as needed.
- upgrade the z axis, which entails the first several points of the taz 4 upgrade list and is quite a bit of work and expense to do ""correctly"", as it involved changing the wiring harness.
- flash firmware
- upgrade the power supply. not required, but the printer heats much more quickly.
- add a filament cooling fan and wiring:

- z axis lead screws located by bearings at each end, adding additional bracing to the smooth rods. (taz 3 z rod is only located by the flexible coupler and z nut)
- metal x axis endplates
- larger diameter z nuts.
- new flexible aluminum z axis couplers between steppers and z lead screws
- new control box: cam lock connectors for all wires entering and leaving. two extruder connectors on the exterior of the box, making it easier to add a second extruder. wire exits moved to clear the new lower z axis motor mounts (a taz 3 control box only works with creative modification) lcd wire harness now externally removable for service 
- different wire harness routing - z axis endstop moves from z motor mount to z carriage and
- filament cooling fan (optional on earlier taz models).
- 24v 450w power supply, sealed molded plastic
- toolhead harness adds 2 pin 24v pwm controlled wires for filament cooling fan
- several y axis motor mount side endplate holes shift 15mm from taz 3 endplate positions.
- y motor bracket changes slightly.
- bed frame to main frame connectors change to prevent bed lifting and shifting.
- bed frame to main frame connectors change to prevent bed lifting and shifting.
 - minor changes to double bearing holder and single bearing holder
 - lighter x carriage with dual extruder cable hold down
 - larger diameter z endstop target bolt (m5 compared to taz 3 m3) and stiffer spring allow for much more accurate z height keeping and eliminates bed height adjustment keeping difficulty earlier taz models were prone to

taz 5:
- hexagon all metal hotend up to 300c. .35mm nozzle in early production, .5mm nozzle in later production. connectors were 4pin + 4pin + 2pin + 2pin in very early production (v2b). some may have shipped with 4pin + 4pin + 3pin + 2pin to avoid mixing up the 24v filament cooler fan and 5v micro blower fan connections. mid production switched to single 8x2 pin connector (v2c).
- pei bed plastic. more durable, lower maintenance (no acetone!!), better adhesion.
- 24v 450w power supply, sealed molded plastic in early production, 500w higher quality metal enclosed power supply in later production.
- toolhead harness adds 2 wires supplying fixed 5v

to the hotend heatsink ""microblower"" cooling fan
https://www.lulzbot.com/store/parts/micro-blower-55v

taz 6:
- hotend upgraded to ""v2.1"" which changes the heatsink cooling fan to a front mounted 5v with printed duct, adds a second filament cooler on the left side of the filament for more even cooling, and changes the toolhead carriage design.
- print volume reduced slightly in x and y to 11.06""
- ""auto bed leveling"" added, which compensates for the print bed being off from parallel with the x carriage and the y carriage not being perpendicular to the z axis. like the lulzbot mini, the taz 6 runs a calibration routine at the start of every print where the print nozzle makes electrical contact with washers at the corners of the bed.  the z height values are fed into the firmware, and the z axis runs up and down dynamically during the print to compensate. also new is a ""sanity check"" during the bed calibration that halts the calibration if a value is outside a reasonable range. this feature automatically halts calibration, wipes the nozzle in a different pattern, then re-starts the calibration.
- automatic nozzle cleaning wipes the nozzle on a replaceable pad prior to the auto bed level routine to help clean the nozzle and aid in good electrical contact during the bed calibration.
- x axis rods increase in size to 12mm
- all smooth rods and bearings are improved to an upgraded high accuracy system
- power supply is moved inside the control box
- control box is expanded
- wiring is simplified and streamlined
- steppers are all black
- x carriage is moved in between the z smooth and threaded rods to reduce leverage
- ninjaflex washer is added between the x/z carriers and z drive nuts to reduce binding
- z home is now accomplished with a push button at the left rear of the bed
- z offset can be adjusted during the print from the lcd
- lcd text interface improved, with larger print in some sub menus and animated graphics for some operations.
- y front endplate changed to match the y rear endplate
- corner brackets upgraded to aluminum
- frame extrusions upgraded to locking t-slots
- travel maximum and minimum endstop switches on all 3 axis (prior tazs had only minimums)
- automatic temperature settings generated in cura, no need to pre-set temperatures
- x maximum and y maximum endstops added.  y endstops are relocated from the frame to the bed itself. x maximum endstop installed on rear of x carriage right blower fan. wireing changed to match.
- change to mounting feet and rod mount on y bed corners using printed dampers
- fillament guide path spinner mounts can now fold up against frame with the spinner removed

upgrading a prior taz to a taz 6 has a number of dependencies that limit piecemeal upgrades.  the mechanical parts you'll need are:
- 12mm x rods
- 12mm bearings
- control box
- aluminum bed plate
- y front endplate (same as taz 4/5 motor end plate)
- extruder heatsink cooler fan
- filament cooler fan
- a pile of heat inserts
- switches
- wire, pins, and connectors for the required re-wire
you'll need to print a bunch of parts as well. we sell many of them, and are working on a kit of parts based on some pre-production chassis from lulzbot

upgrading a taz 4 to a taz 5 is covered in another thread, but to recap:
- replace pet bed plastic with pei replace pet with pei on the bed https://www.lulzbot.com/store/parts/lul ... -pei-sheet
- upgrade the toolhead to the v2 hexagon
https://ohai.lulzbot.com/project/taz4-hexagon-toolhead/
https://www.lulzbot.com/store/tool-head ... ol-head-v2
with requires adding wires to the extruder harness
https://www.lulzbot.com/store/parts/int ... arness-add
https://www.lulzbot.com/store/parts/ext ... arness-add
- flash the firmware to taz 5

upgrading a taz 3 to taz 4/5 is far more involved.
if your want ""cool project, time and money aren't really an object, i like hunting down obscure parts and printing my own upgrade parts"" go ahead with a taz 3 to 4/5 upgrade
if you want a ""taz 4/5"", just buy one ready to go.  you'll likely be money ahead (control box connectors are around $30 ea, for example), and will save a bunch of time.
- perform the upgrades in taz 4 to taz 5 above as needed.
- upgrade the z axis, which entails the first several points of the taz 4 upgrade list and is quite a bit of work and expense to do ""correctly"", as it involved changing the wiring harness.
- flash firmware
- upgrade the power supply. not required, but the printer heats much more quickly.
- add a filament cooling fan and wiring:

recv: echo:busy: processing,"i just started printing again after a 6-week layoff. i upgraded curale to 3.2.32 (and cleared the cache) and flashed the firmware (1.1.9.28) in my taz 6.

with octoprint 1.3.10 (running on a raspberry pi 3 with octopi 0.14) i'm getting:

recv: echo:busy: processing
printer seems to support the busy protocol, will adjust timeouts and set busy interval accordingly

and then a lot of:

recv: echo:busy: processing

i've been told this is coming from the firmware. i believe the last firmware i used was 1.1.9.17(?) and i don't remember those messages (but at my age, i seem to forget a lot).

these messages appear to be harmless (i.e. the printer continues to print) but they are kinda annoying. can anything be done?","in octoprint, you can set a terminal filter to suppress these messages. they still go into the serial log but the terminal window doesn't show them."
lutzbot taz 6 printer nozzle drags back through print,"i am somewhat new to 3d printing giving that i ""inherited' a taz 6 from a previous teacher (i teach engineering at our local hs).  i have printed several things without fail, then i started seeing the nozzle drag through the material at the start of the print.  i have not been able to correct this.  





you can see where the plastic was just bulldozed aside in the picture.  what could be wrong here?  this is consistent across the part so leveling should not be involved.","you may want to first try manually cleaning off the nozzle. it's likely there is material on the nozzle and that's making the printer think the bed is lower than it actually is.

we recommend using a non conductive scotch brite pad as anything metal that comes in contact with the nozzle risks sending a static shock to the board. 

if your first layer is still too high you can adjust the z-offset for you printer. the z-offset is the distance from the top of the leveling washer to the top of the pei print surface and affects how tall your first layer is.

this can be done through the lcd menu by clicking the lcd knob in once to bring up the main menu then navigating to:

configuration --> advanced settings --> z-offset

you can make your first layer less squished by turning the knob clockwise.

once you have found a good setting for the z-offset, make sure to back up a screen and store settings.

the typical z-offset is a number somewhere close to -1.35mm. if you change the z-offset from -1.35 mm to -1.45mm this will make your first layer more squished. if you change the z-offset from -1.35 to -1.25 this will make your first layer less squished.

you can also adjust the z offset live while the printer is printing. i like to do this while it's printing the skirt. you can do that by selecting tune --> z offset while printing."
taz 6 won't stay level,"i have been printing on my taz 6 for about a year now and love it. lately though, in the past 6 weeks, my prints have become awful and unusable. they look very rough and are highly brittle. after much investigation, i believe the right-hand bar that controls the y-axis is turning faster than the left-hand bar. when i measure everything out, the two sides will be 1 to 1/2 inch off in height. i will manually turn the right-hand bar to level it back out and will start to print again and it will work perfectly again. but after only 1 small print, it's off by at least 1/4-1/2 inch again. if i'm doing a larger print, it will start out fine, but about halfway through, it will get off and ruin my print. 

does anyone have ideas as to what is causing this? 
the attachment bad print.jpg is no longer available



 this is how it's coming out. brittle and useless. 


sorry, the photos weren't upside down when i uploaded them.","those ""bars"" are called leadscrews and they control your z axis. the bed is the y axis, the extruder is the x axis. what is probably happening is you have a coupler that is either loose, missing a setscrew or two, or is broken. check the side that is having issues for coupler issues, if that doesn't correct it, there is a possibility the upper or lower 6082rs bearings have sized, or that there is debris in the z axis smooth rod bearings. but its usually the coupler. other rarer failures would be a broken z motor shaft or a motor short leading to only one coil pair energized in that motor. if either of those were the case the results would usually be more dramatic."
taz6 y axis backlash/positioning issues,"recently my prints are no longer printing nice clean walls in the y axis.  i have attached some pix showing the walls of a simple box where the 2 walls perpendicular to the y axis rails are jagged, and the opposing walls in the x position are smooth.

are there components that wear out that would cause this?  or something that needs to be adjusted?

i am considering changing out the hardware to a true linear rail versus the plastic bushings.","the most obvious thing to check would be the belt tension on the y axis, followed by checking the screws that hold the print bed to the bushings and parts beneath it.  of course you should also check the idler bearing that the belt goes round as well as the motor shaft to see if they're loose.  another possibility is that the motor itself may have failed, or the pulley is loose on the shaft -- you may have to remove the belt to check this."

z = 19.80

how do i proced to take these values closer to 20mm?","the easiest way is going to be with cura. use the scale option and un-check uniform scaling.

then do some cross multiplying to find our desired x y and y percentages values. in this case with your measurements that comes out to:
x 100.50%
y 99.26%
z 101.01%

you'll take your desired value (20) and multiply that by 100 (for 100 percent), then you'll divide by your measured value(x,y,z) to get your adjusted percentage.
20*100=2000

taz 6 aerostruder blobs,"greetings all,

having issues with 2 taz6 printers, both with aerostruders.

blobs and poor performance galore.

i'm looking online and seeing common causes ranging from temperature issues to underextrustion.  any observations or suggestions on what could be going on and what actions can be done?

dumpster find,"found this as is in the trash room at my complex. after a few hours of trying to get more information on what model it is, i have decided to turn here. i think it's the taz 1 but unfortunately i've run into a lot of 404 page not found errors and can only find info for the taz 2.1 and up. the power supply does appear to be connected correctly, however there are 4 of them. the psu fan runs when i turn on the power supply but then stops when i turn on the machine.

not sure what issues the previous owner had with this machine but i'd love to see what i can do to get it back up and running. nothing seems to be bent or heavily damaged and moving parts are moving freely. any links and help is greatly appreciated.

someday you will want to consider updating the z axis to at least the taz 4/5 spec, it definitely helps considerably.


sounds like something to look into. do you have more info or a specific link to a forum thread covering this? thank you


here's a thread covering the basic process. viewtopic.php?f=16&t=2303 

in your case you essentially have the electronics of a taz 5, and close enough to the frame of a taz 3 to use that as a direct guide. you can get the x end plates from lulzbot still, and the leadscrews and lead screw nuts can be sourced new or used. itworks3d.com can be a good source for those. in addition to what's swapped out in that thread you are going to want to swap out the main frame to bed frame mounts, as the old style ones can shift unexpectedly.  the only tricky part to the upgrade is the relocated z axis endstop wire, which requires either remaking or extending that wire. once you have that in, and you verify your taz is a 24v tax you can essentially just load the stock taz 5 firmware, recalibrate the e steps, and go to town. alternativly you could upgrade to 6 spec. that requires a bit more work and additional parts. 

you might take a look at the taz openbuilds x and y mods after you upgrade to 5 spec as well."
taz 5 / flexydually ninja semiflex,has anyone had luck printing this material?  i must assume that answer is yes.  i cannot find settings that work.  clogs  / extruder gear skipping.    i've tried so many different temps and settings.   still no luck.  (pretty much everything in the 220-232 range).  i normally print ninjaflex at 225 with no issues (other than your typical cat hairs from this type of filament).,"ninjatek on their website recommends an extruder temperature:  225°c – 235°c for their filaments. since you're having jams at 225-230 an adjustment of 5-10 degrees should be fine.

to clean filament off of the nozzle/hotend heat up the hot end to the extrusion temperature for the filament you are using and then turn the printer off. then use a blue shop paper towel, (you can get some from auto zone or places like that) to wipe off the excess filament and then use a piece of ""scotch brite"" pad to wipe the nozzle off, as it is non conductive and will clean the bottom of the nozzle well. please be careful for the heater and thermistor wires as they are very small and will break easily. you are welcome to do this with the tool head off of the printer, if that will help you access different parts of the toolhead. make sure to avoid using a wire brush to clean the hot end as it can cause a short back to the rambo.

also just a quick note that we sometimes see people use acetone for cleaning. acetone does dissolve abs, but it can also dissolve the wires on the heater block, so we do not recommend using it on the whole hotend. here is our repair disclaimer for just in case:

at aleph objects, inc. we respect your freedom to modify your lulzbot 3d printer. it is important to know that any modifications or attempted repairs that cause accidental or intentional damage are not covered under the warranty.

we don't recommend removing the nozzle on the hexagon hot end because it can cause damage to the hot end. the nozzle requires very precise torque and it is very easy to strip the threading on the hot end if over-torqued. we don't want to encourage any procedure that can damage the printer, so we do not sell replacement nozzles for the hexagon hot end. although they can be sourced from other merchants such as reprapdiscount.com. but be aware that any damage caused while switching out the nozzle is not covered under the warranty"
first layer weirdness,"so i have a small model (say 1"" by 2"" and half an inch high), which i've sliced with cura to print in abs, and need to print it over and over.  after some tweaking, i can print them one after another with a fairly high rate of success.  as the day warms up and cools down, i tend to adjust the z-offset to keep the bottom of the first layer looking good -- close enough to avoid warping but not too close to get squished looking lines on the first layer.  generally the z-offset is somewhere in the 1.85-1.25 range.  

in an effort to speed up my process, i've tried several times without success to print 2 or 3 of the model at the same time.  for reasons unknown, the filament just doesn't stick well on the first layer and ends up pulling the plastic around the bed and eventually makes a mess.  i've tried increasing the flow rate on the first level and have cranked the z-offset down past 1.3, but nothing seems to make it stick.  i can print one model at a time no problem, but two or more just seems to confound the machine.  suggestions?  this is on a lulzbot 6 sliced with cura 2.6.69 using the ic3d abs profile with minor tweaks.","one thing that i would suggest trying is a bed reconditioning, this will get rid of anything on the pei sheet that could be inhibiting its adhesive properties as well as add more surface area to the pei sheet both of which help to improve bed adhesion overall. to recondition your bed get a spray bottle and mix up 1 part alcohol and 9 parts water. get some 1500 - 2000 grit sandpaper. get a sanding block. spray some of the 1:9 mixture on the bed (get it nice and wet. just make sure that your printer is turned off and unplugged). with the sandpaper on the sanding block, wet sand the entire bed until you see a slight whitish film, then stop. clean the bed good using the same mixture with a clean cloth. this process will last a good while. i know this sounds a little strange but it does work really well.

it would also be helpful to see some example photos of some good vs bad first layers that you are encountering so we have that to reference."
taz 5 hot end installed correctly?,"hi.

i recently bought a used taz 5 printer. i noticed that the hot end is loose, but i'm pretty sure it's not suppose to be (it's my first 3d printer, so i'm just guessing here). i checked some photos in the internet and i think the aluminium back-plate that's suppose to support the hot end is not mounted correctly (i attached a comparison)? i reached out to the seller, but he still haven't replied yet, so i decided to create this thread.

thanks for your help,

what can cause z-offset to shift?,"so sometime back i started to have issues with my z-offset. this ended up happening because my filament snagged, at least from what i could tell because on both occurrences, after this happened i noticed a change.

since then the issue has never occured, and i thought i had my offset dial in almost perfectly. but recently it seems once again i have to lower it more, and can't figure out why. i haven't had a snag!

only two things have happened since then
i had to do some sanding with like 3200 grit and some acetone and water + alcohol (1 to 10 mixture) to remove a really stuck on abs residue
the z rods (threaded) are still grinding/buzzing a little here and there. back when a snag happened these got off and i had to loosen the mounts to manually turn then and line them back up. they seem fine, but the left will buzz, only when raising it (where i also am having the worst adhesion). although just this morning i measured the lengths, and they seems almost even.

there was one other thing. after i got it really low, where it was a solid first layer, i raised it back up a bit as it was adhering a little more then i liked. but after some failed prints, and undesired results, i lowered it back down to where it was, numerically. but it's not actually printing the same. i am now getting visible lines, and the back left corner (same side the rod buzzes going up, and i keep trying to just slightly move it, might have finally done that this last time) is having adhering problems.

what is causing this? are the brackets that ride on the threaded z-rods not tight enough and they are slipping? when i adjusted them i was told not to tighten them too much","joshea wrote: ?sat nov 24, 2018 1:16 pm

this will throw your motors/rods out of level. the buzzing means it missed a step. too much binding will cause step loss."
dimensional accuracy is off,"i've had my taz 6 for over a year now and it has been wonderful, but my current printing needs call for more solid dimensional accuracy. i've gone through and ensured belts are tightened, lead screws are properly lubed, and the settings in cura look good. however, all of my parts continue to be too thick. it is like there is an extra wall being added that is not accounted for in the software and i cannot make it go away. any thoughts?","flow. reduce your flow rate(percentage).  plastic expands.  i have mine set to 90% for pla.  every plastic will be different, you’ll have to experiment.  i printed a 10cm x 10cm cube and then measured the walls thickness with a micrometer.

home in cura is not the same as home using glcd,is it intended behavior that homing the nozzle in cura doesn't home the nozzle in the same location as it does selecting home directly on the taz 5 printer?  if i use cura to home the extruder nozzle would hit the clamp holding down the bed; this doesn't happen if i home using the printer.,"i updated the firmware before i thought to take a video.  now the nozzle no longer will hit the corner piece, though when i home x/y the nozzle still stops right over the corner of bed.  when i home z then it will move x/y so the nozzle will not make contact.  the video shows homing x/y in cura, then after the pause, homing z, another pause, home all, another pause, and then finally homing on the taz itself.  definitely less 'fluid' with this firmware, but it works!

taz 6 probing failed after arduino board change.,"hello,

i have recently changed the arduino board on the taz 6 because the old one has stopped working out of the blue. after i have changed the board, i tried to print and couldn't because the probing keeps failing. i wiped the nozzle and everything. is there something i need to do after i changed the board like re calibration or something? i did do the flashing the firmware again. it doesn't work. any ideas? also, the fan does not turn on by default. i used lcd display to turn on, but it turns off while the print starts or every-time i turn on the printer.","it's possible that your x-axis might not be sitting level, this will cause recurrent probing fails because even though it looks like everything is behaving as it should your toolhead is never actually making contact with the washer and is instead hovering just above the nozzle. we have a guide that goes over leveling your x-axis here that you can try: https://ohai.lulzbot.com/project/leveli ... e-repairs/

in regards to the fan not working, which fan is not coming on that you are concerned about? your toolhead should have part cooling fans as well as a heatsink fan, the heatsink fan should come on as soon as the printer does but the part cooling fans are controlled by the setting you have setup in your slicer or by independent commands done through your lcd or cura. from your description it sounds like you may just be looking at the part cooling fans. if this is the front heatsink fan that is behaving this way my first though would be that two of the fan wiring harnesses positions on your rambo got flipped when the new rambo was installed. if this is your heatsink fan it would help to see some photos of your rambo and wiring so i can look it over for anything out of place."

"nozzle diameter, and diameter of extruded material","i own a taz 4 (with a 0.35 mm nozzle), and i have a question about nozzle diameter. i just extruded 10 mm of filament and measured what was extruded, but the diameter of of what was extruded was 0.75 mm, not 0.35 mm.  what i did was this:

1. on my printer i have some gray pla filament (recently purchased from 3d universe)
2. i heated the nozzle up to 205 c
3. i homed the hot end, moved it to the center-x position, then raised it 50 mm above the build plate.
4. i then extruded 10 mm of filament (into the air, not onto the bed), and then snapped it off
5. i then measured the diameter with a digital caliper (and i measured in a few different spots)

i also repeated steps 4&5 a few times just to make sure i got accurate readings.  in every case, the diameter of the filament was 0.75 mm.  i was expecting 0.35 mm... i have a 0.35 mm nozzle - shouldn't it be extruding 0.35 mm?

i've owned my taz4 for several years, i'm the original owner, and i've never replaced the nozzle.  i've only printed in abs and pla (i'd say that 90% of my prints were abs, and 10% were pla), and i've never printed anything abrasive.  so my questions are:

1. over time, does abs or pla wear out the nozzle? (i know abrasive material does, but i've never heard of this being the case with abs or pla).
2. does extruding material with a 0.75mm diameter from a 0.35 mm nozzle sound correct?  (the diameter of what's extruded is over 2x the nozzle diameter)

thanks,

jeff","all filament passing though the nozzle will abrade it.  the fact that you measured 0.75mm is irrelevant unless it used to measure smaller.  all filament ""expands"" when passing through the nozzle.  it has to with material compensation, heat, humidity, and many other factors."

thanks,

tim",if you have recently adjusted your x axis belt tension then you are causing binding on z. if you have not then your z driver on the control board is probably not working well any more. measure the z ref. test point on the control board and see what it reads(located near the z driver chip). should read around 1.2 or more volts.
taz 5 dual extruder nozzle leveling,"we recently purchased and installed a dual extruder tool head v3 for our taz 5. during the printing process, the secondary nozzle constantly drags across the print, which ends up failing before too far in the process. after doing some research i figured out its because the second nozzle e2 is closer to the build plate that the primary e1 we have been using. how do i raise a nozzle on this tool head? everything i have seen says it should be within spec when it arrives but the extra 0.3 mm closer to the build plate is making a huge impact. 

thanks!!","i'm sorry to hear that your hotends aren't level! here's how to get that fixed up:

then using a 1.5mm allen, loosen the 2 set screws (vertical) that hold the shaft in the heat sink.
then with a metric ruler, measure the the un-even nozzle to measure the same as the other nozzle (normally they are 2.1mm (hot end top to heat break).
then tighten the set screws and install your fan and you are ready to print.

step 3 of this guide show the hotends being installed during assembly of the toolhead that you can reference, it should help clear up any confusion with my terminology: https://ohai.lulzbot.com/project/dual-e ... -assembly/"
taz 6 filament jamming up.,"hey yall, ive been having a problem i've attempted to trouble shoot for a few months now (not to much time between work and house work)

when i try to print stuff if it's a short object its fine but at a certain point around 5mm high almost every time (been printing alot of chibi grims.) the filament feed stops. i've tried replacing the hot end, it worked for a bit. although it doesn't jam every time so i'm not sure if it was just luck. i've also tried cold pulls and running different filament. any tips that may help me? i at one point did have clicking coming from the extruder stepper haven't had that in awhile though. not sure if the stepper is going or if it was clicking due to the filament jamming up.","hi guys

i've had similar issues with jams with pla (abs works, which is what i've begrudgingly switched to in the mean time). i'm wondering if it's similar to your problem. for me it seems like it's the filament jamming in the ""cold"" area of the hot end. 

my classroom has two taz 6 printers and both have the same issue with pla based jams or freezes.  

i'm not sure if it's an issue with heat creep as i re-worked the fan that cools the hot end with a rather powerful blower. it's enough that i can cool just the cold end with enough air that the hot end can't keep temperature. i'm still having the issue. 
i'm getting to the point where i'm going to switch to a 1.75mm filament on an e3d as pla is a very important material for our school site (price, safety, smell, availability). 

out of curiosity, how many other lulzbot owners actually print in pla? or are most of us moving to pteg or other alternatives?

edit: whoops, i thought this was a current thread, didn't realize it was for last year!"
taz 5 stringy print,"on the taz 5 i'm printing on, the most recent print came out very stringy with the layers not adhering well to each other. see the attached image.","well, it doesn't have to be a bolt.  i had trouble on my original mini with print quality one day -- turns out that the printed bracket holding the left-side of the x-axis rods had cracked at some point (layer separation).  all the screws were tight, but the entire head assembly wobbled back and forth badly every time the head was at the left-hand side of the print...

the key is to wiggle the bed (it moves) and the head (it moves), and look to see if whatever is moving seems loose or sloppy.  i wish i could give you some specs (e.g. the head should not move more than <insert correct value here> millimeters in the horizontal plane when a force of <insert value here> is applied... etc etc), but afaik there are no specs of that nature available.  so, just move it around -- it'll have some jiggle (small), and flex a bit beyond that.  the jiggle should be minuscule, the flex depends on how much pressure you apply, but if a light pressure moves the head or bed around, then look to see why -- perhaps a bushing is worn, or you have a cracked bearing, etc."
z homing issues,"hi guys.

i have a taz5 and have upgraded my firmware to 1.1.5.7. now i am not allowed to home my z unless the x and y are homed as well. i use manual bed leveling what do i need to change to get the z to home where ever the x and y are?

thanks in advance

gary     ","when leveling a taz 5 bed i've always homed all, then i'll disable steppers and move the tool-head and bed corner to corner by hand. then i'll home again, disable steppers, check my work, rinse and repeat as necessary.

i think this has something to do with z safe homing that's been enabled on the taz 5 recently. if you notice the tool-head moves to the right a bit after homing the x axis. i'm pretty sure this allows you to use a taz 6 v2.1 tool-head on the taz 5 without modifications. since the taz 6 tool-head has an extra fan on the left side it would normally collide with the z thumbscrew otherwise."
taz 4 5 differences,"if a taz 4 is upgraded to use the hexagon hot end and a pei bed, what are the remaining significant differences between it and a taz 5?","the only major differences between the two versions are that the 5 came with an all metal hot end, pei on the bed, internal wire harnesses to support the extra cooling fans for the all metal hot end, and a different connector for hot ends for ease of use. so once you update for the hexagon hotend and add the pei there really isn't any major differences left that came be adjusted. if you flash your firmware as a taz 5 you will then be working with a taz 5 for all intents and purposes."
dual head v3 opinions please,"hi

i am looking to purchase a dual head v3 while lulzbot are out of stock with them in the uk i have found some in farnell,  i am a bit concerned, if they are old stock??? i seem to remember there was an issue with the temp on the dual head and found it was a manufacturing fault,, how likely is it that these might have that fault (if they are old stock)  strange question i know just don't wont to buy trouble,, was all ready to buy from lulzbot when they went out of stock??? ","the temp issue on the dual v3 was due to the hotend thermister(s) being poorly crimped.  the lb psa has the range of serial numbers which were affected... call the store and ask them to provide the serial number.

with that said, the thermister is easy to change out... ~15min.  remove toolhead, remove fan and duct, unclip thermister wring harness, remove retaining grub screw, replace bad thermister.  reverse directions to install.

i guess it really depends on how bad you want/need the toolhead.  its a good toolhead.  prints really well on either/both nozzles."
taz 6 pauses while printing from sd card,"hello everyone, i have been having an issue with my taz 6 where it will pause while printing from the sd card. this occurs with a part i have printed multiple times, where sometimes it pauses and other times it prints with no issue. the location of pausing is inconsistent and does not appear to be associated with the gcode. when the printer pauses it does not resume printing on its own.

any troubleshooting advice would be great, thanks!","did you find a solution to this? i'm having the same issue. i noticed the last time it did it, the display indicated there was no sd card, when in fact it was installed and was what i used to load the printer.

thought it might be that the usb was connected to cura, but i've done that in the past with no issue. 

ready to try another sd card, but wanted to see if there was a know issue here.

that start gcode is actually totally normal, the bracketed temperature area is telling the software to check with the print setup settings and pull whatever value is being used in that area to use when creating the gcode your printer will actually run off of.

taz 5 print jams,"hello, i just got a 2nd hand taz 5 from a buddy of mine, but no background on it. 

i'm having trouble getting either abs or pla to print. both will jam up in the print head and require me to take it apart and manually remove the filament. while i'm getting good at that, i haven't been able to get anything past a couple very small prints to work. 

i've done the basic stuff like clean everything out, including the gear that feeds in the filament. i've read here and other places that these things have issues with heat creeping up the filament and that seems like it's probably the issue. i've cobbled together another fan to help try and keep the area above the hot end cooler. it's warm, but never too hot to touch. 

anyway, just wondering if there is something i am missing here or do i just need to try to cool things down more still? i'm using luzbot abs and esun pla+

thanks for any help","the small barrel cooling fan on the stock taz 5 tends to fail. you may need a new one, or preferentially upgrade to the taz 6 style or aftermarket style fan which will eliminate that. 

also be aware that pla and abs have different melt temperatures. if you get 245c abs in the nozzle and then try to print 215c pla through it, the nozzle may never get hot enough to actually push out the last of the abs."
top layer possible over extrusion,"so i've been honing in my settings to get better quality prints off my lulzbot taz 6 and there is one setting that has been evasive in my efforts to figure it out. from the picture i have attached you can see that the top layer of the print is kinda bubbly and looks like it is potentially over extruding but just on the top layers everything else on the print is looking great by the standards of what i have been able to print in the past.

here is the pic of what is happening, don't mind that the print is unfinished, someone shut down my computer before it finished :/ https://imgur.com/a/mh2eahn

i'm using cura to print with hatchbox pla filament my print temp is 195 and a few potentially relevant settings are:

top/ bottom thickness- 0.8mm

top layers- 5

bottom layers- 6

top/bottom pattern- lines

flow- 120%

top speed- 40mm/s

print speed- 60mm/s

if you want some more information about what settings i am using here is a link to my current cura profile: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ylu2sh ... sp=sharing

thanks for any tips you might have!","it looks like your flow is set to 120%. this means if your printer is calibrated correctly you are extruding 20% too much material.

try reducing your flow to 100%.

custom gcode for maintanence tasks,"hey all,

i had an idea the other day and wanted to know if it was bat shit crazy or common.  and if common i wanted to hear from others who’ve done it and for what purposes....

as i was using the lcd to switch filaments (which involves manually moving axis to home and then about 30-40mm above z home, setting temperature of nozzles, extruding in reverse filament, then loading new filament, and extruding until 10mm of clean filament comes out) - it dawned on me i could custom author gcode script to do most of the steps rather than fussing with the lcd everytime.   

have others created custom gcode scripts for such non-printing tasks?","i'm sure its do-able...  the closest i've come is a start script to prime and print a cleaning strip along the bed edge.

the firmware for the dual v3 has a filament change script which is accessible from the lcd menus.  it pauses the print, retracts the filament, prompts to insert new filament and advances before restarting the print.  it didn't work reliably the one time i tried it... 

i suppose you could write a script to unload filament from the new ""titan-type"" extruders.  heat up the extruder, extrude 2mm then retract 20mm... an independent, on-demand nozzle cleaning script could be useful also.  send the scripts through octoprint or any control software.

1. when i turn on taz, the red led is off. after a while it lights up (no blinking). 
2. as the temperature is above ca. 60c, the red led starts blinking.
3. the fan in the power supply starts
4. the taz restarts.

the sequence repeats every time, the only thing that changes is the exact temperature at which it restarts.

kmanley57: the green led in the power supply does not blink. does this discard a power supply failure? 

so, if i understand the board seems to be the culprit by now, right? is it reasonable to think that the board is shutting down for some reason when there is ""too much"" current being drawn (that is what i guess because it only happens when i'm raising the temperature). 

if the problem is related to static charge/proper ground of my electrical instalation, i could maybe connect a wire from the aluminum case of the board in the taz to some ground-ish in my home like the aluminum windows frames?

the part cooling fans are 24v while the heat sink fan is 5v. the oem for the 24v part cooling fans does have higher cfm fans in the same form factor, but their minimum order quantity is in the hundreds making it a little bit expensive for an individual. higher cfm 5v fans are available.

i've just mounted two external 80mm, 12v fans on the frame. 12v fans in a variety of form factors are easy to find.

taz 6 e3d conversion and fan ducts.,"hey guys,

thought i'd share this since it was a massive pain right at first. so i've done the conversion to the e3d v6 full kit and things are now running beautifully. my z issues have all disappeared and getting much nicer finish on my printed parts. however one thing i have always disliked about the taz 6 is the tiny low output cooling fans used. long story short the fans are axial and as a result not efficient at all at blowing air through a small aperture.  this was abundantly clear on each i switched to the e3d in addition to the cooling fans also blowing cold air on the heater block which sits a tad lower which is pretty much a bad thing for maintaining even heat throughout the print. so here's the stl for improved cooling system i'm running. the fans i'm using can be found here for dirt cheap...

brand new at this stuff,"brand spankin new at 3d printers other than have seen one before at work. so i am thinking i want one.... i'm not positive why i want one, but i do. i started out looking for a el-cheapo model somewhere around 3 or 4 hundred bucks, whil;e doing searchs for the best rated printers the lulz-bot line kept coming up and i was intrigued, now i want a 2,100 thingy that i am not even sure how to use. and to make things even worse i am pretty sure i want dual extruders and  probably want to print with the flexi filament also.

so after a few weeks of reading i have questions if anyone is willing to give some advice i am quite sure most of these questions have been answered before but when i search for them i didn't find simple direct answers so here goes
a.   i see the website has a lulzbot taz flexydually tool head v1 which i assume will extrude any of the filiments.....is this correct?
b.   i also see there is a v1 and a v2 for the dually heads is the flexidually an old version?
c.   auto leveling is it worth the money to add on?
d.   i also see alot of mods being made to these taz 5's which ones are good and what order should they be made?
e.   software needed..... i see curo, but also alot of talk about slic3r, i do currently have autodesk inventor as well as access to solidworks 
f.   when i order in a few days what type of filament should i order to begin with?

any rough guess as to how much money i will need to invest into this thing to make it really really cool

to be honest i may not need everything, like the flexi stuffs or alot of other add ons, but i am a machinist by trade and expect my equipment to be able to perform to my standards even if i don't need it at all times

any encouragement or comments will be appreciated

a.   i see the website has a lulzbot taz flexydually tool head v1 which i assume will extrude any of the filiments.....is this correct?
b.   i also see there is a v1 and a v2 for the dually heads is the flexidually an old version?
c.   auto leveling is it worth the money to add on?
d.   i also see alot of mods being made to these taz 5's which ones are good and what order should they be made?
e.   software needed..... i see curo, but also alot of talk about slic3r, i do currently have autodesk inventor as well as access to solidworks 
f.   when i order in a few days what type of filament should i order to begin with?


a.  yes, the flexydually v1 can print all (or most) non-flexible filaments on the back head and can print flexible filament on the front head.
b.  yes, the v1 (flexydually) is the original and the v2 (dual extruder tool head) is brand new.  primary difference other than the improved design is that it uses two hexagon hotends rather than the original budaschnozzle.  the hexagon's can print at significantly higher temperatures and subsequently a higher range of filament types.  
c.  that up to the buyer.  if you are very new as you mention you are, then auto-leveling would be very helpful in your initial learning curve and success rate.  prints take a bit more time to start since the auto-level process adds some time to the beginning of a print but that price comes with the advantage of more successful prints.
d.  one of the best things about the taz (in my opinion) is how much you can upgrade and change if you desire.  there aren't really any that you absolutely should do first.  it's all up to what you'd like to do and how interested you are to try different things.  if you're mechanically inclined, many of the changes are quite straight forward.
e.  cura and slic3er are free and come with the printer.  inventor can render stl files so you can use it for modeling but cura and slic3r are used to prepare the 3d model to send to the printer.  it generates all of the paths and behaviors of the print head (layer by layer) to print the object.
f.  filament...  now that's a big question.  the easy answer is to order a couple (2-3 colors) of a particular type (hips, pla or abs).  practice printing some models, observe any differences between the different spools and then begin to buy some different types over time.  i would  personally recommend pla or hips to start and then move to abs.  pla specifically has a lower melting temp and is generally considered one of the more forgiving materials.  hips is very good as well and abs is great.  i print primarily with abs but having gone through the new-user experience almost a year ago, these are my recommendations.  even if you had hundreds of dollars to spend on filament and went off and immediately bought 5 spools of every type of material you could find, you simply need time to become familiar with the differences of each.  and ultimately, all the reading in the world can't replace getting a spool of a new material and hitting the print button and watching it up close and then touching it with your own hands.

i hope this helps.  

ps:  if you do get a taz, i sincerely hope you enjoy it.  if you consider yourself marginally impatient or if your adverse to trial and error, i might recommend the mini.  my bro and best friend both have minis and they love them.  but like me, my brother is now considering upgrading to the taz 6 as soon as it is released which i'm hoping is very soon.  if you hadn't seen/heard about the taz 6, it's the next one coming and it has all of the functionality of the 5 plus more, including bed-leveling and many more...

good luck."
z-offset and 1st layer height,"i've had my taz 6 for a couple of years and recently replaced the standard bed with the new modular print bed. i'm also using the lulzbot print head with a .35mm nozzle.  since installing the new bed my first layer seems very thin and i'm getting very strong adhesion to the bed in comparison to with the standard print bed. so i'd like to set refine my z-offset and cura initial layer height settings. the problem is that i don't understand the relationship between these parameters. 

using pla in cura, for example, i use these settings:
   nozzle diameter:  .35mm
   layer height: .14mm 
   initial layer thickness: .3mm

working with lulzbot support, they've suggested that with a .35mm nozzle and using calipers to check, my first layer should be .33mm. they suggested i adjust my z-offset to make that happen. 

so given the cura parameters i've listed, does this seem right? should the cura initial layer thickness be smaller (.3mm) than my measured goal of first layer height at .33mm?

art",what does your first layer height look like in comparison to your set height? is it less than the .3 layer height or what. you may need to adjust your settings for the new bed characteristics.
solved taz 6 bed not heating,"ok, so i'm having an issue with my taz 6. my bed stopped heating out of the blue one day. i switched to my spare bed and still not working. i got in touch with support and they had me check the resistance on both the bed heater and bed thermistor. no problems either at the bed or anywhere along the wires to the rambo. they had me change all of the fuses and still no luck. 

they told me the problem is most likely in the rambo. since my taz is out of warranty i decided to buy a new rambo since it would've cost as much just to ship it to lulzbot for repairs. i'm still having the same problem. everything else works fine and i double checked that i installed it correctly and double checked the heater and thermistor and everything seems fine.

could it be my power supply? that's the only thing i haven't checked, but i have no idea how to.",the 24 volt rail/source is common to all three 24 volts supplied to the printer. so if the supply did not work on one it would not work for all. more likely a wire from the supply to the connector of the terminal block connector on the control board.
bed adhesion or what?,"so i have been printing small projects for about a year now. *i decided to do a 5 part project and it was doing really well on the first half of the project. *then i started with these adhesion issues. *

i have a taz 6, using ngen colorfab. *recommended setup is 230c nozzle, bed 85c. *i use glue stick, from a lot, to little. *i get different results with different colors within ngen ie. gray metallic always has problems. *so does silver metallic. *black, white and red colors seem to work better, however i you can see in the pics i was having a good print with black but then when i woke in the morning, it was off the bed and warped. *

i have tired 60c, 85c and 70c bed temps. *i've tried painters tape. *i've tried 245c nozzle. *i have adjusted the print first layer. *i've made sure the z axis is level. *i have adjusted the z offset and i have tried to adjust the first layer in the slicer. *i'm using curale. *high detail, print height 0.18 and first layers 0.36. *ugh>>>>>>>. i don't know what to do next....

","in the last picture you posted, it looks like your z-offset could use some adjustment, due to the waves that are showing in the print.  this could also be why the prints aren't sticking to well.  the z-offset only affects the first layer of the print, however if it is off, then it will cause those waves that are showing up.  here is what a good first layer line should look like.

you can adjust the z-offset on the taz through the lcd screen, by going under configuration, then advanced settings then z-offset.  we recommend doing small adjustments around .05mm at a time, to help prevent the nozzle from making contact with the bed.  once you have made an adjustment to the z-offset through the lcd screen, you will want to make sure to back up a menu and store settings.

try reducing the printing temperature by about 5c for the lighter colors to see if that helps get better results with them.

also, try printing with a brim, to help hold the parts down on the bed to see if that helps with the warping any.  you can then just pull the brim off when the print is finished."
taz 6 rambo 1.3 for board replacement.,"hey yall i figured out my extruder connection ended up dying on my rambo v1.3l

the problem is lulzbot doesn't have any in stock atm, i ordered a board from ultimaker (or whatever the place is that sells them) not realising there's a difference seems as though the only thing missing is the power connection to the second extruder. not a problem i don't use the second extruder and can solder in the pins if i ever need to. 

question is if i flash the rambo v1.3 with the script in the lulzbot board documentation. everything should run fine shouldn't it? or is the rambo 1.3 different in some way i cannot see from the 1.3l that it won't work correctly.","galadriel wrote: ?wed sep 26, 2018 9:08 am

that is correct. um does not install the pins for the 5v aux out or the x30 pins in the opposite corner of the board by default. they will send you the lulzbot version of the board if you let them know that is what you need.

lulzbot, you should sell the bare lulzbot config board on your site rather than only selling the kits. the kits cost too much. we don't need wires and switches. that drives your customers to purchase the board from um which causes issues for them due to the missing pins.


it looks like it is out of stock currently unfortunately (at least in the usa) but we do sell the rambo board without the wiring harnesses and connectors, just as a heads up  here is a link to it: https://www.lulzbot.com/store/parts/ass ... connectors

please help. i have attached a picture of my model in this thread to give you an idea of what i am doing.

thanks in advance!","if you are going to do a lot of detail work mixed with ""regular"" work, you might consider a second tool head. i did and can switch back and forth in just a few minutes (plus cooling and heating time)

so you have two different tool heads with different size nozzles?  then perhaps you execute the “pause at height” script/plug-in, swap out the tool heads and press resume.  is this correct?

i’ve never tried it but, you don’t get an error about the system being unable to detect e0 or any other kind of error as such?

i am interested to know more about this technique ; i printed some molds and the fine details were on the top and i could’ve used the larger nozzle size to build up the base quicker.  along the same lines of this, is there a way to have multiple layer heights within a print?  i tried using the “use adaptive layers” setting in the experimental section but the results didn’t turn out too good for me.  i would like to control the layer height throughout various points in the model."
taz6 hanging and failing,"hi,
i have been successfully running the taz6 with the firmware from about two years ago and the cura v21. not one issue... 

so today i decide gee maybe i should upgrade to the latest firmware and get the latest cura... which i did... 

now the machine performs like crap. it stalls, pauses, hangs and wont finish the simplest print! 

tell me why i upgraded again??? 

this is sickening when software is trotted out as tested and robust and its not. i had to abort the last print after an hour or two and the model was perfectly fine. i printed it before  in fact using a different material. then i started using abs a few months ago and stuck with that. no problems until i ""upgraded""... 

more like downgraded... 

does anyone anywhere have any idea why this untested software was released number one and number two how to get the old firmware back???

i'm still having the same issue as the original poster in this thread.  i've been in touch with ty in tech support and have tried numerous test prints over the last few days, all with the same results:  extrusion ceases at z=2.0 to 3.5mm. prior to that, the print quality is awful; i can see the nozzle 'snow-plowing' through the lower layers.  this is true with both pla and abs. 

i too had been running prints very well until i updated cura and flashed the printer eeprom.  i saw your suggestion of going back to the old version of cura, but couldn't it equally well be an issue with the printer firmware? 

i've spent a lot of hours on this in the past week and i'm getting close to sending the thing back to you. i suspect there are bigger problems here than you guys are admitting.


sorry to hear about your frustration! i have been running with cura le since before it's official launch and can assure you that it is very capable of producing excellent quality prints, it can take a little getting used to (changes in layout which is why we like to make sure to offer people the option to use the legacy version, but i wanted to make sure i let you know that at least in my opinion the software was definitely a big upgrade from legacy cura.

in regards to this being a firmware issue, whenever you change the software version you are using you will need to change the firmware to the accompanying version so if you go back to the legacy version of cura you would also need to go back to the matching legacy firmware. if you have been using a mismatched version of firmware and cura it could explain why you are having so many difficulties using the software. i would recommend making sure you have the correct firmware version by either flashing your firmware or opening the console and entering the command m115 in the bottom text entry box.

could you post your cura log and some photos of your failed prints? i want to check and see if i can spot what is causing your issues. i have included the various pathways for finding your cura log based on os:

extruder head encased itself in abs overnight!,"i am in a very tough spot... i was printing an abs print that was going to take overnight to print. so i began printing and it seemed to go along all right at first. so i went to bed. 

i put a new roll of abs on from gizmo geeks, black 3mm. 

when i came down in the morning i was shocked to see that the model had come off the bed and that the taz6 had continued to extrude overnight and somehow managed to fully encase itself and the wires around it in abs... it is almost a half inch thick... it followed the wires, encasing them as well. 

this effectively shuts me down as i cannot heat up the extruder to the point where it can soften the exterior encasement of abs. i have no idea what to do in this situation. 

how can i get this stuff removed? am i supposed to use acetone? if so it will take days to remove a half inch of abs... i am completely bewildered. i dont even know how this could possibly even happen!

i wanted to attach the image i took but there is no upload.","the abs typically won't stick to the metal... a heat gun might soften it up to the point where you could remove most of the filament.  might need a knife to cut 

the wires are concerning... but its only the heater block and thermister wires that should be affected.  hopefully the abs didn't wrap around any of the wires and you could salvage.  ultimately the thermister and heater isn't very expensive."

did you make sure when you upgraded the firmware you chose taz 6 + aerostruder and not taz 6 + standard?

yeah i’m just saying that there’s been sooooo much discussion here on these forums about failed prints with pla filament.  let’s understand that pla has one of the lowest melting points of the most common filaments and is one of the cheapest filaments price wise.   unfortunately it’s melting point is just low enough for all the heat sources to cause it to fail.  ambient heat, heat rise from the print bed, extrusion speed, extraction and retraction moving the filament up and down as it softens, all contribute to the perfect storm.

i actually purchased a 11cfm fan to replace the stock fan but before i was able to swap it out i eased up the tension on my idler screw on the hob bolt and started making it through the prints.  however most my prints were under 2 hours, and now my prints are fully printing.  back and forth between various print heads, height of summer now and again experiencing failed pla prints,,, except with the new aerostruder print head.  so i theorize that the stock print head and the dual v3 printhead is just not designed well enough to prevent heat creep for pla.  there needs to be a better design to keep the pla filament cool.  the aerostruder print head may have been designed to cool the filament quicker to make longer and straighter bridges across gaps but the design also seems to not cause heat creep on pla.

i’ve thought about running the pla filament through some ice gel tunnel somewhere between the print head feeder and spool of filament.  i suspect the room temperature still isn’t cool enough at 76 degrees.


oh i see what you mean. that just might be it, but wouldn't i also have run into this problem last summer? i got my taz 6 in may 2017, and printed like a fiend for the first few months without issue.

and remember when i said prints were succeeding with the fan pointed at the printer? i just tested that again, and had a failure at about an hour in. same story, the filament gets ground...

see if you have one of the affected serial numbers

2.) here's a link to the physical frame squaring check procedure:
https://ohai.lulzbot.com/project/squaring-taz-6-frame/

if you were to disconnect the load on the z-axis by disconnecting couplers that ride on the z-axis rods and were to turn one of the rods you would see the other rod move up or down in parallel with the one that you are turning, so yes they are synched together.  therefore if you're going to try and level the two disconnect the wiring harness from one of them and then adjust until they're level in respect to each other, if you don't i think it goes back to the same position, thus remains out of synch.

personally i find the tape measure method difficult when you're dealing with millimeters trying to get them as close to the same as possible between each other.  lay a strip of wood or something strong and flat that you can get on the couplers and put a level on that strip, then adjust accordingly until the level reads level, then reconnect the wiring harness.

when i first got my taz 6 mine got out of alignment somehow until eventually one of the couplers cracked.  i returned it under warranty for repair and lost a lot of $$$ in the shipping cost.  that's what they found, a cracked coupler.  i learned!  hope this info helps you and others like it did me.

lulzbot, i don't remind removing the pins, but would you mind just adding a note about that in the online documentation? it would be much appreciated and i'm sure future customers would appreciate it as well."
sd card slot loose,"i have had my taz 6 for over a year now, love it. just recently the sd card slot has become loose. i put the sd card in the slot and i have to use a peace of tape to hold the card in so it will register, then i can print from the card. is there something i can do to fix the sd card slot?","unfortunately the sd card slot is built directly into the lcd screen so if the sd card slot is coming loose it would require replacing the full lcd screen. the good news is that replacing the lcd screen is relatively easy and since it's just the sd card slot that is damaged you should be able to reuse all the wiring which will make the installation process easier. it doesn't look like we have the lcd screen in stock on our website (at least for the us) currently so in addition to the link to our site i am also including a link to our supplier.

our site: https://www.lulzbot.com/store/parts/ful ... -smart-lcd
our suppliers site: http://www.reprapdiscount.com/home/34-f ... oller.html

we also have an assembly guide for the taz 6 control box that would walk you through installing the new lcd screen: https://ohai.lulzbot.com/project/taz6-c ... bly/taz-6/
you'll really only need steps 5 and part of step 6 for this. it's important to note that this guide shows a rambo 1.4 which is the newest iteration, you will most likely have a rambo 1.3 that has slightly different wiring for the lcd screen, the differences between the 1.3 and the 1.4 wiring for the lcd is all on the rambo itself the connections for lcd screen didn't change so even though the coloring and layout of those plugs on the rambo will look weird it should still hookup to the lcd screen exactly the same."
live z adjust,"how do i do a live z adjust while my taz 4 is printing?  i'm on marlin from 2014.

the reason for my question is that if my hot end is too low or too high i need to move the hot end down or up to compensate.","thanks for the info.  i upgraded my taz 4 hardware to taz 6 with the metal corner washers that get tapped to create the print plane, the thicker x-axis rods, anti-seize bushing on the z-axis, etc; however i did not upgrade the electronics box and i'm still running taz 4 dual extruder firmware because i was unable to get the taz 6 firmware to run properly on my setup.

i guess this is another reason to take another stab at getting the taz 6 firmware to work on my upgraded printer.  i'm wondering if the electronics box also needs to be upgraded to run the taz 6 firmware properly or if it s/ work on the taz 4 electronics box / rambo board?"
dual extruder v3 - why angle the filament channel?,"i've done several multi-hour prints that failed hours into the print because the filament gets stuck in the chamber and quits feeding.  this never happened with the single extruder because the channel was straight so the filament didn't have to go through any gymnastics to make it to the nozzle.  for some reason this head was designed in a way that requires the filament to have to significantly bend to feed.  i've used the jig to tighten the screws to the right distance but it didn't matter.  i tried a few turns tighter but it doesn't matter.  tightening these screws and the curved chamber also makes it way too hard to load filament.  most of the time i have to untighten the screws to be able to hold it open to load, which then has me counting turns to get it back to jig depth.  this seems like a bad design to me.

i've wasted days and 2 spools of filament on this v3 head between the temperature issues recall and these feed problems.  i wouldn't be so mad if it would screw up instantly so i didn't stand around waiting hours for a 15-hour print and have it suddenly get stuck 2 hours into the print.

is anyone else having these kinds of issues?","joebowler300 wrote: ?mon mar 19, 2018 10:26 pm
the fan on the single head that came with the taz 6 is slightly deeper than the one on the v3 dual head; don't know what the specs are on it but i'm guessing its the next class up of 6.xx cfm.  i do not experience the heat creeps with the single head and pla filament.


all the fans on my taz 6 single extruders are the same part (same part number) as the one on the dual extruder v3 and the aerostruder, the 5v version of https://www.lulzbot.com/store/parts/40m ... w-flow-fan.

replacing the fan requires removing the 4 hex head bolts, cutting the wires on the old fan. splicing the wires to the new fan, replacing the 4 hex head bolts. on the dual extruder v3, the bolts are very long so replacing the 40x40x10mm fan with a 40x40x20 fan will require finding 10mm longer screws. 

amazon sells this noctua fan (amazon nf-a4x10-flx-5v) which is the same size at the stock fan but has a 25% higher flow, 4.82 cfm (stock fan 3.87 cfm)."

","ehoff, thanks for your feedback.
to answer to your question, there is full range in x-axis without issue.
i was expecting this problem could be cause due to pc/fw/sw. it’s seem really random the situation, keeping the rest of the object perfect. 
yesterday, i increase the belt tention (without instrumentation) and also start using the sd memory.
i print two parts without issue.
no sure if the situation will appear or is fixed with the belt tension or sd memory. i think i will implement one of the tension system shared in the forum, it’s seem very convenient.

"lulzbot taz 5 motherboard swapped for rambo 1.3, printing only limited to a few inches on x/y axis","hello.

i am currently using the taz 5 printing model and due to software malfunctions after restarting my computer during printing, this left the printer only functional on the horizontal axis, it seemed as if the vertical axis was removed. attempting to fix this, i looked online and found the solution of simply replacing the circuit board by the rambo 1.3 board. after doing this, the printer regained its vertical axis ability. however, the vertical movement is only limited to 1-2 inches. are there any hardware changes i must make to fix this issue, or perhaps a software change.","it sounds like you may just need to install the firmware for the taz 5.

taz 6 - dual extruder v3 - esteps?,"hello all,

just a quick one, i've recently upgraded my lulzbot 6 single extruder with a dual extruder v3.

now for updating the firmware, depending where i read, i get told that i need to manually record and transfer my original esteps and z offset but in other places (unless i'm interpreting it wrong) i've seen that i do not need to do this. either way, i'm not clear on which i should do.

are you please able to help clarify this? thanks in advance.",for working with the new v3 extruders you won't need to worry about the adjusting the esteps as they are a default setting in the firmware and shouldn't need adjustment. when you revert back to your standard extruder you will want to have the esteps for that toolhead recorded somewhere so you can adjust them back to the correct esteps for that toolhead. i would say that if you ever have a question about something like that the most reliable location to get your information from (aside from directly from tech support) will be our ohai. we have a guide for installing the v3 that goes over this question in step 8 here: https://ohai.lulzbot.com/project/lulzbo ... cessories/
dual extruder v3 prints with wrong head midprint and other malfunctions,"i work with a taz 6 that has a dual extruder v3. i have been having many issues with it that i can't seem to pinpoint. 

1) i will print something and one printer head will stop working and the other one will continue
2) the printer will work for a layer or some time before making garbled-looking prints. sometimes it will start printing properly once again.
3) the wrong extruder will extrude filament when the right extruder should be. not only does the wrong filament come out, but it's offset by however far away the extruders are. this also randomly fixes itself.

i cannot figure out what is causing any of these issues or if they're all related. it seems as though they're related because they've all started happening at the same time and seem to happen randomly.","when you installed the v3 dual extruder did you need to update to the newer version of cura? if so did you make sure to clear your cache and remove any instances of cura from the 2.6.xx branch from your computer? is this happening with a variety of models? could you post some photos of the way the failed prints are coming out so we can see the garbled effect you described? my first thoughts are a file error, a settings conflict, or possibly older code from your cache interfering with the slicing process."
aerostruder z-offset,"forgiveness if this has already been addressed, a quick search of the forums didn't appear to yield the answer.

for those of you with the l.b. aerostruder, did you have to significantly alter your z-height offset? mine was printing way to close to the bed at -1.35, like way to close. the bottoms on my prints were smooth and lettering from benchy, totally invisible. dimensional accuracy also seemed off by 1-2%

i had to change the offset all the way up to -.8 any closer to the bed and the first layer didn't look right.

just curious if anyone else experienced this on their taz 6 with aero.","i didn't have to adjust my z-offset when upgrading to the aerostruder, however if you are having problems with the first layer, here is a picture showing what a good first layer line should look like.

taz 4.1 motors not working,"hi, i recently took over for a co-worker who left last year and he was on this forum asking for help to fix the shop's printer. i've run my own tests, but this is what he posted as being how the problem started.

""i have the taz 4.1 at work. we got her fired up and printing last week. she had been sitting in the corner unused for the last year. we did a few of the sample prints and once i learned a bit more about temps and surfaces we had a successful voronoi tower printed. next day if started the printer and did the preheat, ran the extruder to clean it a bit and make sure i have a good filament line coming out. i attempted to print the venus de milo sample (sd card) and her base started to curve eventually becoming unstable at around the halfway point. she rocked herself out of position and when i discovered this it was a half statue with a glob of melted plastic on top about the size of a quarter. i stopped the print and cleared the mess. after resetting the printer with the reset switch. i started it back up, preheated the unit. but when i sent the unit to ""home"" nothing moved. so i attempted to manually via control interface the machine. i chose 1mm for every axis, the extruder one at a time. nothing is moving. nothing is functioning. i can physically move the components in the xyz directions so the unit isnt jammed, and my switches function i checked with a multimeter and manually activated them in checking for ""open/closed"" indication. what can i do to fix this or troubleshoot further. ""

i read elsewhere for connections i need to check, so here is  a rundown of what i've done so far:
1. i checked the small fuses and they are just fine. i even swapped them with new fuses from the new rambo board i ordered and there's no problem there.
2. the main fuse is fine as well. same deal with swapping it from the other board.
3. i replaced the whole board. the new board seems to work fine, but there's a new issue with the new board where the lcd screen is blank. it's on, but it's just a blank blue screen. i think i may have bought a bad board from the official site, or it was damaged in transit.....somehow. either way i can't print anything so i don't even know if replacing it fixes the problem. i've checked connections and reassembled it from the ohai three times with the same lcd problem.
4. i checked the power connector. 24vdc from the two live pins.
5. firmware is up to date as well.

any assistance helps. i'm at a total loss. i don't own a taz myself, but i do own a prusa i3 mk3 at home.","i know you said the firmware was up to date but i have to ask, did you update the firmware since installing the new rambo? the rambo won't come preloaded and almost every time i see someone have a hard time with the lcd screen not fully coming on after installing a new rambo it is because the the firmware hasn't been flashed or the wiring got flipped around."
taz 6 flashing ? on screen after firmware update,"i recently upgraded to the latest cura lulzbot edition 2.6 and updated my firmware on my taz 6.  now that it is done, i immediately noticed the x y and z on the printers lcd screen keep changing to ?'s. so the x the y and the z go back and forth from the letters, to ?'s.

why is that happening and what does it mean? this is the first time i have updated my firmware since i bought the taz 6 in nov of 2016.

thanks for any help.","those question marks will reappear when you cycle power because it erases your printers information on the location of the axises, that is normal and nothing to be concerned about. the sd card issue could be a couple things, when you say you can't print anything does it register that a card has been plugged in but not show any files? have you tried a couple different sd cards? are you making sure to load the files onto the card as a gcode as opposed to a stl file?"
print time meter?,"we are trying to track actual print time on our machine, and you all know that the slicing programs are about useless for any tracking over two hours.  has anyone hooked up an hour meter to their machine?  i'd like to have something that tracks the total time of a print, plus the overall power on and operating time of the machine.  

i am doing this so that we can track breakdowns and tune up intervals.  we are making a quick guide for 3d printing in the field for usmc eod techs.","marlin currently has an option to turn on the print timer to log total hours. we currently do not have it enabled by default, as when updating firmware it will clear your eeprom and reset the timer. we have submitted a ticket to generate a version with this turned on, and can be followed along for its progress here: https://code.alephobjects.com/t3226

"prints end up ""printing in air""","i'm running into an issue printing...  i haven't seen this type of issue ever reported (anywhere) and i'm stumped as to what the issue is.

i'm printing in pla on my taz 4 (i upgraded the bed to the new pei sheet, but the nozzle is the original (not the all-metal one) and the firmware is still the same (4.1 i think)).  lately when i print, after an hour or so into printing i'll check on the print... the head will still be moving, the print it still attached to the print bead, and everything will seem normal, except the nozzle isn't dispensing any filament (event though the filament gears are moving)

here are some recent prints











you can see that at the top where it fails there are wisps.

from this image you mighty infer that the issue has to do with the z-axis, but i don't think the z-axis is the case - other failed prints have failed at different heights.






i think the issue might have something to do with the gears chewing up the filament - after a print fails, i've removed filament form the hot end, and noticed that its been chewed up.











i thought the issue might have something with retraction, so i created a simple block, printed it w/no infill (this resulted in no retractions), yet the print still failed (and at the same height)






it almost seems that the nozzle gums up and prevent the filament from being extruded, yet, when i remove filament from the hot end, clip the chewed-up end off, and then put the filament back it, it's able to extrude.

i've tried printing w/cura as well as simplify 3d but i get the same results.  any suggestions as to what the issue is?  or how to trouble shoot it?

thanks,

jeff","i may have posted too soon... i just read a few posts underneath mine a posting from jralvarez (""filament grinding"") and it looks like he's experiencing a similar problem.

here's some more information on my situation though:
* the filament is pla and is quality filament from matterhackers (and the clear/white roll i'm printing with is new)
* i'm printing at 195 nozzle and 65 bed.  matterhackers recommends 205 +/- 15.  i've tried 195 and 205.
* i am printing in a closed enclosure.  i haven't checked in a while, and i forget the actual temp, but it's warmed up (been printing for several hours) it gets up to 50 c (not sure though...  i'm going off memory here)

temperature not keeping up,"im new to printing and currently using cura with a used taz 3 i bought on craigslist.  printing seems to be fine, however, the temperature initially set to about 200c (which is what i set) but now it seems to stay somewhere around 182c.  i tried setting it higher to 210 but its staying around 182c","piercet wrote: ?tue feb 09, 2016 8:00 pm
that usually indicates a damaged thermistor or heater core, or a printer that is inside a freezer. you will likely need to replace the heater core, but double check with an inexpensive point and shoot infrared thermometer that what the hot end thinks it is at is actually the correct temperature. you can get spares of the buddaschnozzle hot end thermistor and heater core from i-t-w.com, though they appear to be out of the heater cores.


 this style of ir thermometer is actually not great for temping our equipment due to the way it uses refraction to calculate temperature, the metallic surface messes with its calculation causing misreads that are lower than the true temperature of the nozzle. just as a heads up  
jaded wrote: ?thu feb 11, 2016 6:30 am
i believe it's the original taz 3 hot end.  it only happened that one time.  it initially got up to 200c and slow dropped off and stayed around 182, for the rest of the print, even though i tried setting it higher to 210c.  curiously, i've done other prints since then, and it has stayed within 1c of target temp.  i've even improved the print by messing with the settings.


did the drop in temperature occur with a print that you have since completed successfully? were you working with an stl file that you sliced yourself in cura or did you have an sd card with an old model that you loaded up for a test? what cura version are you working with? could we some more photos of your printer? did you try setting the temperature higher through the lcd screen or through cura? from your description there is a small chance this could be a fluke of software issues."
room temperature inquiry,"ladies, gentlemen,

regards,
anas.","the layer lifting may definitely happen, but you will see it more on certain filaments. a lot of the higher printing temperature filaments (abs, some nylons, polycarbonate) will have a much harder time printing, as they print much better when the area around the printer is at a higher temperature. lower printing temperature filaments (pla, ngen and other petg) will do much better, but still may have a few issues if the cooling is too high. in some cases, if the air is cool enough, it can cause the tool head or bed to error out with a mintemp error, as the tool head/heat bed is cooling too much (this is a rare issue, but i have seen it come up before). if your printer needs to be under the vent, you may want to look into getting/making an enclosure for your printer to keep the airflow off, and the temperature consistent."

i have an itworks one now. lulzbot one arrives tomorrow. i can give more info in a week or so, but to date i have had terrible luck with flex materials on the itworks version. it just pinches and feeds out the side even at 15mm/s. worth noting i got the 1.75mm a2 nozzle, a2 hobb, titanium heat break build. ive had to tear it down and rebuild it 3 times now. gear was jamming within a week of receiving it first. then a heat creep issue clogged it. 3rd time was user error, print didnt stick to the plate, found a globbed mess 3hrs later.


i'm having the same issue on my itworks version with flex materials. it's the exact same issue that you were describing with the material feeding out of the side. did you ever fix that issue? not sure what i can do right now.


unfortunately not.  i just have not had time to mess around. ive just marked that machine in the same batch as the trex2+, ones that you expect to handle anything but no flexible. i mostly have it dedicated to abrasive stuff now.

the only way it could be fixed is reprinting the bracket with the clearance tighter between the drive gear and the feed tube. simply a design flaw unfortunately. im not a bug fan of either the lulzbot or itworks aerostruders. they grind almost as much filament as they push. the lulzbot one cant handle 80% fan at 215 for pla without thermal runaway from overcooling the nozzle. the itworks is lighter, and overall seems to be better than the lulzbot design by a small margin. the option to customize it from them is a big plus as well. not good enough id say i recommend it though. even the stock bowden extruder on my cr10s5 that i stuck a volcano on seems to keep up better."
blobby prints on taz6,"we workplace has a taz6 for general use, and it apparently prints ok for most people, but i've been getting blobs on my prints.  

i observed the printer printing a blobby print and the printhead would pause for a second and then keep moving.  extrusion continued during the pause and that would lead to a blob.  in fact, the print looks as if the material that was supposed to be spread along a layer of the print got stuck together into the blob and a gap was left where that material was supposed to go.  another observation is that the bottom part of the print, which has a very shallow curve, is totally blob-free.   i've had this blob problem with various different tweaks of this model.  i also saw another person who printed little trophies suffer from the same problem.   i tried changing the circular parts at the top to hexagons and the blobs decreased, but did not entirely go away.  

since it seems like this problem has to do with the pattern of print head movement it seems like it's a control problem or a problem with my model rather than a problem with the filament or the environment, or other types of settings.   but the particular print below was done using cura, and the settings were all default except that i changed the support percentage to 10% and turned on the raft.  

does anybody have any thoughts?   my model is in openscad, and i could post that or i could post the stl here if appropriate.  




","maybe i should see if the talk about the sdcard slot being broken is correct.  do you generate gcode with cura and then put it on the sdcard?  

i'm not sure that i can get permission to connect a different computer to the company printer.  the computer that is connected to the printer is a dedicated computer used only to run the printer.  that doesn't mean it's not trying to do windows updates or something.  but i checked during my latest print testing and cpu utilization during the print was about 2% with gpu utilization at 15%.  this doesn't make it seem like the computer is a choke point.  would there be any benefit of using something other than cura to send the gcode to the printer?  

i did some test prints where i tried to print subsets of my original model to find a test case that would be faster to print.  of course, my initial print (center in the picture) came out perfect.  it looks very smooth and beautiful.  i then tried printing a different subset where the circles cross.  that one is shown at the right.  it prints perfectly up to about 7mm high, then the middle section is rough textured over all, with a few big blobs, and finally the top 6mm or so is smooth and perfect again.  for my next test i printed the first model again.  it is not quite as perfect as the first time.  i turned on the brim, because i had experienced problems with the start of the print before.  but this one shows a rough texture for the circular base part of the print, and is smooth thereafter, but not quite as smooth.  there is rougher texture around the edges.   not sure what to make of that.

capacitive auto bed leveling,"why doesn't lulzbot use capacitive auto bed leveling like ultimaker?

ultimaker's capacitive auto bed leveling actually taps the bed numerous times with the hotend with great accuracy.","if the system is based on capacitance, it wouldn't need to touch the bed.  which would be a step up from having to touch the bed.  i never found the capacitance sensor part that's built into the toolhead... but did find the reference in the ""electronics"" section of the guide.

couldn't find a reference in the s5 pages i skimmed through for additional touch points... which would be a waste on a flat glass plate.  i did notice that the glass plate sits on metal plate similar to lbs modular bed... an inductive sensor would be more reliable.


regardless, i think there have been community members who added a capacitance sensor and fsr to perform bed leveling on the taz5.  it would be a good mod to tackle for the taz6... probably just an adjustment of the probe coordinates in firmware.  probing the pei would be susceptible to bubbles and could be detrimental to the surface if the nozzle is at extrusion temp.

i'd be interested to hear the results if you do pursue.  it would probably mitigate a lot of issues with parts stuck to the bed from bad bed leveling."
switching to gizmo dorks pei sheet,"hi everyone,

new to 3d printing and got a taz 6. it's been going quite well so far and have done a bunch of prints. a couple weeks ago i noticed my pei sheet had a few air bubbles. i squeezed them out and it was working fine again but then on one print i saw that not only had air bubbles came back, but an entire corner of the sheet was lifted off the bed. after looking through the forum i decided to replace the pei sheet.

first of all, i'm not sure it's actually pei.  it's thicker, and it warps badly eventually.  one side will pop off the glue after a few weeks or months. forcing you to replace it.  i've had much better success with actual pei directly from lulzbot.  it's a lot cheaper, and usually instock, both are issues withe real pei, but i wasn't happy at all with the gizmodorks stuff.


after the lulzbot pei sheet started bubbling up from the base i replaced it with that gizmodorks sheet and used a sheet of 3m to adhere it.  it has been great.  first, it is pei (not sure why you would think it isn't).  as long as you do a good job putting it down, it should last as long as the stock sheet did.  the only issue is that the 12""x12"" is slightly smaller than the bed (about 3/8"") so make sure you center it well.  finally, at $20, the gd pei is actually cheaper than the lulzbot sheet ($45)."
"7 kg of plastic, and my x & y linear bearings are warn out.","i have at least 1mm vertical play (i can see the bearing shift relative to the rod) on the y axis, and a small but visible play in the x axis. i am rather surprised that these bearings wore down after only 7 kg of plastic.

those bearings are designed to be press fit into a housing with a preload. the 3d printed parts cant take that much force. the usual way to get a better contact pattern is to loosen the bearing holders and move them onboard or outboard until play is reduced. you can also change to other setups. if you decide to try metsl bearings, swap the rods out at the same time for harder ones or else you will chew up the stock ones. one person had good luck with somewhat spendy oilite bushings.  or there are openbuilds rail alternatives.


i don't think this has anything to do with the 3d printed parts. i took a video to show that the wear was on the purchased bearing.

i'll know more when the replacement bearing arrive and i take the machine apart.

prints jam halfway through - taz 5,"for the past month or two my taz 5 has been jamming half way through prints. i kept cranking up the temperatures, from 205 to 230, but eventually that stopped working. i thought it was due to the cooling fan getting old, so i added the split duct to the cooling fan in increase cooling. this helped the problem, though print fails still happened whereas they almost never did before.

now, i replaced the cooling fan with a 40mm fan and i'm still having problems. it seems to be jamming after a couple of layers, barely extruding material. sometimes it recovers, though sometimes it doesn't. it may also happen more often when there's shorter layer times or more retraction.

could my thermistor or nozzle need to replaced? 

this print was done at a nozzle temperature of 228c. i haven't been able to figure out how to export settings from cura 2.6. thanks for any help!

","you can use a retraction test from thingiverse to set your retraction. https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:909901

print it with 0 retraction then add retraction 0.5mm or 0.1mm per print until stringing is under control. you should be able to get by with 1mm or less, in my experience.

what is a pretty cool ambient temp for you? keeping the room at 75f or lower will help reduce heat creep jams.

you could also try reducing the hotend temp. that filament probably doesn't need 228c. try 205.

what layer thickness are you printing? if it is really thin, try the same part at the thickest layer you can print with your nozzle and see if jamming is reduced. the general max layer thickness for a nozzle is around 80% of the nozzle diameter. this moves plastic through the nozzle at a higher rate. that reduces the heat creep problem because the plastic has a shorter dwell time in the hotend and doesn't heat and expand as much in the heat brake.

if you are still running the tiny blower hotend fan, upgrade to something larger. there are solutions on thingiverse.

i asked about the hotend temp because some part cooling fan setups can over-cool the hotend when they kick on. if you temp is staying within a few degrees of the set temp throughout the print, you should be ok there. i doubt you have a thermistor problem."
lulzbot randomly called it quits,"hello! so i was just replacing my hotend nozzle and had the tweezers around the actual hotend holding it in place when all the sudden my whole lulzbot taz 6 turned off and now will not turn back on. i am pretty sure i didn't hit anything (although one of the ends of the tweezers was near the back towards the big red wires, but again pretty sure i didn't pull on anything). if something were to have happened it would be compressing the wires which should not break them. do you know what could have happened? i tried restarting my machine and when the switch is flipped to on nothing happens. any advice would be amazing! i was trying to replace the left nozzle on the dual head v3","it sounds like what you have here may be a blown fuse on your rambo. does the red power switch still light up? if it does, then i think that it is the f3 fuse on your rambo that you will need to replace. 

here is a picture from reprap wiki that highlights the fuses on the rambo: https://reprap.org/wiki/file:ramb1-2-fuses.jpg

the fuses that are on the board are a nano2 surface mount fuse, and you can purchase them here: https://www.lulzbot.com/store/parts/5-a ... olyfuse-x3

there is also a test you can do before you purchase the fuses to 100% confirm that it is the f3 fuse that is the root of the issue. you can swap the f2 and f3 fuses, as they are the same type of fuse, then power on your printer. the lcd should light up, but the motors will be unable to move. this way you can see that you only have one blown fuse (now in the f2 fuse spot) on your board that you need to replace.

in this case, it sounds like you may have fried the fuse due to the printer being on while you were replacing the nozzle. when using metal on the hot end, it would be best if the printer is off to prevent anything shocking the rambo through the 5v line."
separate boro-glass from silikon heat bet,"how is possible  separate borosilicate glass from silicon heatbet? unfortunately my glass is broken... 

thank you.

daniel","if your glass has broken unfortunately you will need to purchase a replacement for the full bed, the heating pad isn't intended to be removed after application with our standard heat bed.
there is a new modular bed system that we recently added as an alternative for minis and taz 3 and up printers which has a separate heating element. this is nice because it means with it you can replace just the glass/pei surface not the full bed but it is also handy because it has a more consistent temperature range across the plate because of the sheet metal the heating pad is laminated to and you can flip the bed over to print directly on glass which is useful for certain filament types. whatever route you go make sure to check out our ohai guide for the installation instructions for your replacement.

large shifts on my prints,"hey all, 

i am getting some shifting on my prints, and its pretty large. i cant for the life of me figure out what to check next. i have tightened the belts, set screws, tried various prints and it always shows up. i moved the location of the filament from the side to the top, no change. its not in the same place either, but its pretty close. i am still a bit of a rookie with this, and tech support hasnt been very helpful with this endeavor. i thought maybe my front door slamming, or the upstairs floor was causing it so i moved the printer downstairs on a rock solid granite top. im just at a loss.....getting pretty frustrated","from what little i could see of the print, it looks like it is happening the layer immediately after what looks like a zip tie mounting point.  sometimes you get upwards deflection on a part as it cools on a larger layer, and depending on position it can be up far enough that the nozzle hits it, causing a shift rather than just printing over it. usually that can be elminated by further tightening the belt, ensuring your printer is in a temperature controlled environment without major swings (i.e. an enclosure, and watching the print about at that layer and making sure you manually press any protrusions down before impact occurs. or redesigning the part to elminate that lift point. 

if its on the y axis direction specifically, it could just be belt tension. a belt that is plenty tight for normal bed travel may not be tight enough after you double the mass on the bed. 

but in this case i'm guessing that was an impact based off how little it shifted. usually a belt shift will go several teeth over if it goes."
dual extruder dummy plug for second connector,"i installed a dual extruder (v2 and v3) so i have the second connector on the tool head mount. if i switch tool heads from the dual extruder to the single extruder without flashing the single firmware first, then i'm stuck. i have an error and the printer won't talk to anybody so i can't flash the firmware!

what i need is a dummy plug for the second connector with a 100k resistor across the thermistor pins so the dual firmware will be happy enough to let me flash the single firmware.

i'm guessing that i'd have to buy some minimum quantity of parts in order to make such a beast but i'll bet the folks at the lulzbot factory could throw some together and sell them on their website for an insane markup but a reasonable price for one.

i had replaced my bed three times due to bubbling and was very hopeful lulzbot was going to have the problem fixed on the modular bed.  i emailed lulzbot prior to buying it and they assured me that the adhesive would not have bubbling problems and is good for the temperature.

the bed arrived looking pristine...  then...  i had small bubbles on the modular bed after one 30 minute print.  picture attached below.

so i emailed lulzbot-  i told them there is a problem with the adhesive and it's bubbling as soon as you turn the heat on.  they replied that they think the bubbling is normal!  i strongly disagree-  an appropriate adhesive should have no bubbling whatsoever...  i was directed to the 3m datasheet for the adhesive, which does say it is good for high temperature (for short time periods), though it doesn't say at what air pressure, which is also quite important.  it's probably showing the temperature the adhesive is good for at sea level-  and bubbles are more likely to form at higher altitudes and higher bed temperatures.  or maybe it's water or alcohol trapped under there and vaporizing with heat, from an improper installation.  after seeing it happen a number of times, i believe it's some light hydrocarbon residue in the adhesive which is vaporizing.

i have also attached images after 10 prints and 20 prints.  the bubbles grow every print.  when i asked lulzbot how they would like to address this issue they told me it's really no problem, but if i wanted to i could only return it within 30 days and i would be left without a bed...  so much for the renowned service.

the bubbles normally take more than a month to become a problem under what i would consider normal hobby use (and they seem to become a real bad problem every time if you're printing abs or petg!), and then lulzbot will not help you once they grow larger and you have a bubbled bed problem after a couple months.  replacing the bed is a pain-  start to finish its a couple hours with a razorblade and i just can't bring myself to do it again knowing it will just bubble again.  you can pierce them with a razorblade, but the bubbled area doesn't really stick properly anymore once it has bubbled.

lulzbot seems to have no plans to address the problem or make it right with customers that have spent hundreds of dollars on beds which are garbage after very little print time.  once the bubbles are large enough, they cause major adhesion problems due to thermally insulating the print from the bed, and they cause physical deformity of the print.  once large enough the bubbles literally move around during the print and pop your print off.

what causes this kind of bad print,"3d printing noob here.  i have a taz 5 that a friend of mine is letting me borrow to play around with.  i set it up and printed the octopus just fine.  one project i've always wanted to do was to print the parts needed to build a cnc machine.  does anyone have an idea as to what would cause this?  i had the temp set to 230 and the bed was at 50 printing at 100% speed.  if i tried to print at 200 it acts like it struggles to get any material to come out of the extruder.  i've backed the material out and pushed it through manually to make sure there wasn't a full blown clog.

that fan angle does look a little off, and could be that mount was for the taz 5 with the hexagon extruder. 

one of the issues with the older budaschnozzles, was insufficient heat sink cooling when printing long pla prints. one of our resellers had re-designed the fan mount in order to provide better cooling. this was a go to recommendation in support before we added dedicated heatsink cooling fans to all tool heads. i would recommend downloading and printing out this mount instead, and keep it running at 100% except for the first layer when printing pla. https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:374906

taz 6 is retracting more filament than specified,"during the auto leveling process, i have the gcode retract 2 mm to clean the nozzle. i'm using the same test print on 6 taz 6's, and some of them are pulling the filament entirely out of the extruder without stopping. some printers work just fine, pulling out the specified amount. i've tried resetting to factory settings, but they just keep pulling the filament all the way out. none of this makes sense to me at this point. any suggestions are appreciated!","make sure you have set relative extruder mode (m83) before retracting 2mm of filament. if you are in absolute extruder mode (m82), g1 e-2.0 will move the filament from its current value to the value of -2.0  which could be a lot of filament.

g90 and g91 set absolute or relative mode for all x, y, z, and e but m82, m83 only change the absolute or relative mode of e.

try setting the nozzle temperature to the high end of the range for the filament you are using. block the cold end cooling fan (the always on fan) so the heat creeps up into the cold end. after about 15 minutes, insert some new filament and attempt to push the old filament out. as soon as you clear things out unblock the cold end cooling fan and retract the new filament out of the extruder. 

after everything cools down (i.e. the cold end is back to its ""normal"" temperature). you can try a cold pull or two to make sure any left over filament is cleared out. i use the esun cleaning filament for this and i'm very happy with the results."
taz 6 heated bed not heating - perplexing puzzle - [edit - solved!! heater pin melted on rambo!],"i've been using the taz6 for over a year, so far, working wonderfully.  but now the bed doesn't heat, and troubleshooting is a real doozie.  neither lulzbot support staff nor i have been able to figure out what is going on.

most recently, when i tried to print, the bed wouldn't heat up, so the print wouldn't begin because it was waiting for the bed to come up to temperature.  when i lower the temperature manually, it will continue the print.  raising the temperature manually, or via a print job doesn't work.

things i've measured/tried:
thermistor
the display shows a reasonable temperature measurement (26c)
the displayed temperature is responsive (can heat the thermistor and 26c increases as expected)
thermistor reads 95kohms
i think i can safely say the thermistor and its wiring are not the problem
heater
reads 1.9 ohms
seems appropriate
just to be sure, i replaced the bed assembly, no change
i think i can safely say that the bed assembly isn't the problem
rambo
the f4 (15a automotive fuse) still has continuity
the mosfet seems to be in good shape
the red blinky light is working, which i think is supposed to mean that the bed heater should be getting power
heater wiring
i get 18-22v at the heater connector
if i connect one side of the heater connector (don't complete the circuit), i read 18-22v from the heater side of the connector to the open side of the connector coming from the rambo.  this works on both sides.  so i think the connections are ok.
when i complete the connection and plug both heater connectors into the cable, the voltage drops to 10mv, practically 0.
this makes me feel like the board is able to source the voltage, but wimps out as soon as there is any current draw.  that makes me think it might be the mosfet in some fugue state where it isn't totally busted, but somehow is providing voltage, but gives up as soon as there is a current draw... but not sure.


any thoughts on this mystery?  should i replace the mosfet?  with which one?  or do i need to plop down the $220 for a new rambo (or buy a new one cheaper somewhere else since i don't need the connector kit - recommendations?)

[edit - solved!!!]

thank you so much for your help kmanley57 and piercet!  i finally figured it out!

i replaced the rambo and after examining the old one, i found that the right pin for the heater wire was melted off of the rambo.  pretty scary/surprising stuff.  it's possible to fix, but just wanted to add this info for those of you looking for solutions at home.

thank you for all of your help.  pictures below for the curious.

note the long pin on the right of the long black connector - it is marginally melted off the board.   






from the back you can see the solder has been melted on the leftmost solder pad in the line of through-hole connectors for the black connector.  crazy that those pins get that hot.  perhard the connection was just not quite good enough and heating up with all of that current passing through?

sorry for not describing the voltage check on the heater connector at the bed well enough.  here's what i did:

2. connect the positive side of the connector coming from the controller to one of the leads for the bed heater.  measure the voltage from the open ground on the controller side of the connector (not connected) to the positive connector on the bed side of the connection (connected), reads ~20v.  that means the positive connector is good.  good...
3. disconnect the positive connector and instead connect the ground side of the connector coming from the controller to one of the leads for the bed heater.  measure the voltage from the ground on the bed side of the connector (connected) to the open positive connector on the bed side of the connection (not connected), reads ~20v.  that means the ground connector is good.  good!  that means that everything should work!  but it doesn't.  and when i...
4. connect both the positive and the ground and measure the voltage between the two on the bed side of the connector (all connected now), the multimeter reads ~10mv.  i'm a little perplexed at why that would happen... unless the power electronics were having trouble supplying current, or if there were large resistances somewhere else in the system.

help with filament stripping,"i've had my taz 6 about a year now and been printing with it very successfully for most of that time.  now i'm unable to print more than a few layers before the filament stops feeding and the hobbed bolt just grinds a notch in the filament.

this started when one of the ""prongs"" on my idler arm broke.  i started getting some  stripping on the filament, so i had a buddy print me a new ""beefy idler"".  the filament still wouldn't feed consistently, so i decided i had a clogged nozzle.  did a bunch of cold pulls that looked like there was some trash in the nozzle head.  pulled the nozzle off, cleaned it, put it back on, but i'm still getting the same issues.

i thought maybe the new idler was too tight, so i've tried it looser and tighter and nothing is working.  i know the nozzle isn't jammed as i can manually feed filament and it's coming out straight and clean (no curling at all).  cold pulls look clean as well.

the pla i'm using is inland 3mm.  nozzle temp is 205.  i gone through 14-15 spools of this filament before i started having these issues.  any ideas of where i should look next?","mwester wrote: ?sun may 20, 2018 11:34 am
a quick thing to check is the idler bearing that pushes on the filament (the one on that short rod that clamps into the beefy idler assembly) -- does it turn freely, and is it clean and clear of all plastic residue?


checked this real quick...  it appears that the bearing is turning freely, but to check this, i tried removing the idler only to find that the nut that holds it on is stripping it's socket and i'm unable to remove it.  looks like i'll have to cut it off.  some googling reveals this is a problem, and i found an idler on thingiverse that uses m3 heatsets instead of that silly nut, so i've got amazon winging all that stuff to me.  i'll update when it gets here (wednesday?)

@kcchen_00 - the filament i'm using is brand new out of the package, but to answer your question... no it's not the only spool.  as i said earlier, i was on like spool 15 or 16 of this stuff and suddenly started having issues.  i was using a spool of inland green, and just kind of assumed it was a ""bad spool"", even though it was ""new"".  i bought it from a microcenter in boston, so who knows how long it was on the shelf.  they sell way more 1.75 than 3mm, and green seemed like the color no one wanted, so i grabbed it.  this theory seemed to be further reinforced when i switched to a spool of inland black and printed several big pieces (250g) with no issue.  in fact, i had zero issues with that entire spool.  loaded a second spool of black and suddenly my problems reappeared!

i checked the diameter as recommended and it looks good, at least the couple of sections i just spot checked.

since my idler is currently extremely loose and stripped, i'll try the alignment steps once my new heat set adaptors arrive.  another thing i did notice is that my filament is ""sawing"" through the idler arm, so i need to print a clip to align it so it's going more straight down into the extruder than it currently is.  probably  a new spool holder to mount the filament to the top of the frame instead of the side.

i've got a prusa mk3 that should be shipping on monday, so i should have something to print new parts with if needed as well.

i'll update when i get the idler repaired and can proceed with troubleshooting.  i really appreciate the help so far!"

i was having the same issue with my taz5 with the heater plate sagging in the middle.

as work around until a permanent fix is implemented, support suggested that i use 4 of the taz 6 wiper pads to support the center of heat bed.   with the wiper pads supporting the center of the heater plate, my bed temperature is within a couple of degrees of the display and uniform across the build plate. 

 you do need to print/use the bed corners in the taz 5 modular bed instructions.   the link to the pads

i would also contact support about this issue if you haven't done so already.

jons","just done it myself- there is a youtube video done by lulzbot that explains how easy it is (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ph_l0xvzbrs) - takes about two and half hours- oh and its very messy.
put the pei in the freezer for an hour.
get a paint scrapper/stripper and begin to peel off the pei- it should come off in one piece- takes three minutes.
next soak a piece of paper towel in methanol/isopropanol and place on the sticky surface- do this in a well ventilated place- the fumes can make you ill.
scrape the mess off until you can see your face in the surface- the hour long bit. the glass surface can't be damaged by scrapping- really all you are doing is wiping the mess off. a good polish to finish.
peel off the paper off the back of the new pei and slowly place slightly over lapping the edge. (don't take it off completely do it a step at a time- see video)
use a very flat scrapper to spread the pei out flat and work any bubbles out as you go- my first go i got it 98% perfect. 
however the surface i replaced works fine- just a bit messy, so prepare to get sticky- not a nice job to do- but isn't hard to do. difficulty rating 3 out of 10. messy rating 9 out of 10- beware sticky fingers afterwards- don't use the methanol to clean your hands- can burn your skin.

lulzbot taz dual extruder v3 tool head dual color,"has anyone had any experience/success printing dual color on their lulzbot taz dual extruder v3 tool head?

i am thinking of buying one but just using it for soluble supports doesn't seem to justify getting it.

thanks!","the dual v3 is one of the better extruders out there for the taz.  both extruders produce objects that look like a single extruder.  i print abs exclusively and objects from either extruder look like it came from a single extruder toolhead.

its probably not the best for beginners... there's a learning curve with the filament path and the combined cold side.  i find that printing a bit hotter helps with this toolhead.  

loading, just let the extruder do the work... cut the filament to a chisel feed into the extruder point side down, and use the gears to feed the filament.  don't try to push it all the way through the extruder to the hot-side."
the first layer,"hi all,
just wondering about the first layer on this taz platform.  i am coming to the taz from a prusa printer with different size filament and nozzle.  the first layer on that machine is, like all of them, very important and dialing it in to perfection means eliminating any gaps that exist in the first layer as it is layed down by adjusting the live-z and going from there. i have seen numerous pictures since i purchased the taz where the first layer from this machine is listed as great when it still shows gaps in the first layer that is put down.  i have also seen pictures and comments that show a flat first layer on the taz described as too ""squished"" which on the prusa i would consider almost perfect.  my taz was shipped from the factory at 1.630 on the z offset, i print pla with it at 1.750 to get a first layer that is void of any gaps like i would on my prusa machine.  now it has me wondering, is the first layer quality on a taz different?  should it not be so squished?  are gaps between lines on the first layer acceptable on a first layer print from the machine?  any help and pictures of your first layers you consider perfect would be awesome.

thanks","the first layer is really a personal preference.  i personally like it completely flat with little to no extrusion spacing visible on my taz5.  most would consider that too close for the initial nozzle height, and prints are difficult to remove the print from the pei bed without a proper spatula tool.

here are few other factors to consider for the first layer:
- most important thing about first layer is adhesion.  better adhesion will be achieved with more squash -> lower initial nozzle height.  but too close and it will create too much adhesion.
- completely flat first layer could make the print difficult to remove from the print bed
- avoid ""elephants foot"" - if you strive for a completely flat fist layer flaring of the first layer would indicate that you're possibly too close, or too high a flow rate/multiplier.
- with some slicers, the flow rate for the fist layer can be controlled to create a flat surface.  i use 125% in s3d and adjust my z to get the smoothness of the bottom surface.

with the taz, print removal is optimal when bed has cooled below 60c.  50c is the ideal and recommended temp.


that may not have answered your question, but hope the insight helps to acquaint yourself to the taz."
firmware change for taz6 bed size change,i am investigating the change in bed size for the taz6 to 300 x 900(y). what will have to be done to the firmware to make this happen.,"it depends on how you handle the hardware and the thermistor  placement. a 300 x 900 bed is going to require more amperage for the heater than the stock rambo board will handle, so you would need to put a relay in line, probably using a dedicated power supply. you also may have to go up to a nema 23 motor size. so you may need to change the motor firmware, but the bed wiring would just trigger the relay and heat via that anyways. if you are using the auto leveling you would also need to change the bed size, bed auto level washer target positions, etc."

violent shaking along x-axis,"fairly new to 3-d printing. we've been using a taz 6 in a small academic library for about 18 months. recently, when the printer starts going through it's auto leveling when starting a print it will shake violently when moving along the x-axis. we're not sure what is causing it. adjusting the wiring to the x stepper seems to help sometimes, but not always. 

thanks in advance for your input!","well about a month ago i found that my x axis motor cable was hitting the z homing button body during printing and had broken most of the motor wires at the motor connector. i have had to replace/repair it to resolve my problem, and i hope that is not your problem."
graining on first layer,"greetings! first poster here! i just upgraded to a taz 6 from a heavily modified printrbot simple metal that i've had for several years - great little printer, but it was time for an upgrade. however, i'm running some problems on the first layer of one of my first prints. i'm using pla from pushplastic, which i've always had really good luck with on my printrbot.







i've highlighted the two areas i'm specifically having problems with in the image. i'm getting good adhesion in some locations, but others are ""graining"" and not sticking at all. i've tried the following but haven't had a whole lot of luck:

cleaned (and re-cleaned) the pei surface with ipa (the alcohol not the beer)
increased the bed temp for the first layer to 80c
increased the extrusion temp of the pla to ~210c for the first layer, and 205 for subsequent layers (although i'm not getting past layer 1)
reduced the movement speed to ~40m/s for the first layer
moved the part around in cura to try printing on different areas - and when i print, different sections of the print will grain.


i've read through various posts and guides online that seem to point me to the bed still not being clean enough. but before i go and take something abrasive to the brand-new pei surface, i wanted to ask here to see if anyone had any other thoughts.

thanks much!","that's almost certainly a filament flow issue. there are several things that can cause it. here's a general troubleshooting guide

1. check the idler tension. make sure the idler arm springs only have about 8mm space between the washers on either side of the springs or less. 
2. open the idler. with the arm open can the bearing in the idler spin freely without any restriction? if not clean or rep[lace it with a 6082rs bearing. 
3. with the idler chamber still open, check the hobbed bolt for any debris and shavings, clean the individual teeth, then reclose. 
4. given the pattern you are seeing, i don't think this is a nozzle height issue, but check for the left front corner being slightly higher than it should be anyways. 
5. this could be a heating or cooling issue. check that the central bore cooling fan is spinning properly, and check that the thermistor has good contact. it's possible the thermistor may need to be replaced. they are inexpensive if so. 
6. check the diameter of the filament. if its much over 3.2mm, discard the roll and try a different one. 
7. check the small feed gear on the extruder motor. the setscrew can sometimes come loose. it also can sometimes loose teeth. 

if none of those seem to be the issue, start a new print and carefully and safely try and prevent the main gear from turning gently. you shouldn't be able to stop it rotating easily. if it feels like the gear has almost no pushing force, you may be dealing with an electrical issue. long story short there are two magnetic coil driver pairs in the stepper and if one of them is disconnected or burnt out, the motor will still attempt to turn, but it won't have enough force to do the job. this can be caused by a loose pin, a burnt out motor, a wire short, or in some rare cases a board issue. it's most likely not the board. check all fittings and try again. 

if that all checks out and its still doing the issue, check the filament path from the spool to the hotend. make sure there is no roll drag, or pinch points, make sure the hotend is aligned to the cold end properly by briefly loosening it and then tightening with the filament still in place. it is extremely rare but possible that you actually have a nozzle blockage. it's almost never actually a nozzle blockage. 

hope that helps!"
rock'in moarstruder,"hi just wondered if anyone else had this issue ...
the width of the tapered tongue of the moarstruder backplate is narrower than the width of the bolted on retainer on the carridge unlike the aerostruder which is size for size.

after christening the moar print head with parts for a spool holder i found there were substantial ridges in the walls of the parts. 

even after checking the head was seated well and retightening the head it can still be rocked side to side.

is it wise for me to open the upper edge of the fixing hole to allow the taper to engage better with the backplate ?","at one point with my taz i had some wobbly feel in the original tool head.

i eventually loosened, adjusted and reattached (tighter?) the bottom groove piece where the hot end sits.this seemed to help.. 

i'm not sure that will help but might be something to look at. it was long before i got my moarstruder. 

in my case the moarstruder seems snug and doesn't rock back and forth as you're describing. i would hesitate to open up the hole although on my moarstruder it's already more of a tall oval (slot), so maybe ok. the screw sits about 3/4 up from the bottom of the hole and on mine it is snug in the bottom groove.

3rd party nozzles?,"howdy,

i want to print a bunch of files i got from a kickstarter: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/pr ... =user_menu and the suggested nozzle size is .2mm. the nozzle that comes with the taz 6 is .5. i emailed customer support and got the ""we allow users to modify their machines but do not support it."" (paraphrased) response, which is fine. but, i don't know where to get replacement nozzles of different sizes. can anyone point out a source?

regards,

tim (a.k.a. dirk)","a couple other things to consider. 1. your nozzle is your leveling sensor in a taz 6 or a mini, so don't buy the non conductive olsen ruby tipped ones, don't use nonconductive thread sealer on the nozzle, other than that, any e3dv6 compatible nozzle will work."
recommendations to fix this print?,"hi all,
new taz6 owner here, just got it yesterday. i printed this dungeon tile and have a question regarding what i am seeing on the printed object.  i am coming to this new platform from a 1.75mm prusa mk3 so this larger filament is a new thing for me.  i don't see these kinds of striations on the smaller filament size printing the same object.  i am not sure what to start tweaking to get those lines to disappear.  the bridging that is done in some of the corners is not the issue, there is a hole in each of the four corners that gets covered up.  you can see in the picture how the flat layer has gaps in between each pass of the print-head.  



this is printed at a .25 layer height on a .50mm nozzle from simplify3d with 4 top layers, 3 bottom layers, and 2 shells. the part is very sturdy.  i have the bottom (1st) layer pretty well dialed in (i think) as i adjusted the z offset until the gaps disappeared but these gaps on upper layers have me confused.  i have never seen gaps between lines on upper layers in any previous prints from other printers.  my extrusion width is set to auto which is showing it at .60mm and currently my extrusion multiplier is at .92.

i know it's hard to diagnose some of this stuff without knowing every setting and just looking at a picture but any suggestions on where i should start tweaking would be greatly appreciated.

this printer has provided, by far, the best 3d printing experience i have had out of the box of any 3d printer i have ever owned.  it has taken me three months to get my mk3 dialed in to a point where i find the prints acceptable and it is still not where i want them to be.  the print in the picture above is the first print on this machine after the rocktopus and a calibration circle and i am highly impressed with the print after only a few hours of unboxing, setup, and flashing of firmware.

thanks again, i really appreciate your time and suggestions.


lulzbot taz 6 single test.fff.txt


looking at that profile, i see a couple things that look odd to me. i don't use simplify3d generally so you may want a second opinion on these, but here are my thoughts. 

1. you have extrusion multiplier set to 0.92. that means that you are telling the program to under extrude. 1.00 should be extruding exactly what the printer firmware is set, setting it to 0.92 is telling the extruder to under extrude by 0.08. that could cause gapping. 

2. you have width set to 0.6mm. with a 0.5mm nozzle i would expect to see that as 0.5mm, but auto width is also on so it may be ignoring that setting. if its not, that might explain the 0.1mm gap. 

3. your first layer percentage is set to exactly 100%. that's good in theory, most print profiles set that to at least 105% or more to give the first layer extra adhesion. if you are getting good adhesion with 100%, you may actually be overextruding, but showing up as underextruding due to the width issue above. having that extrusion percentage higher than 100% does lead to ""elephant's foot"" syndrome on parts if it is too high so there is a definite balance, but being right at 100% and having prints adhere well is unusual. 

4. your first layer height is set to 90%. a taz has a pei bed surface, and for printing abs at least you actually want a thicker starting first layer than your subsequent layers for good adhesion. i am not sure if that also holds true for pla. typically i would have a first layer of 0.4omm for subsequent 0.25mm layers with my prints. 

i don't know simplify3d well enough to tell you if your infil settings are correct or not. i would generally run a part like that at higher than 15% infil, or if i was running it at 15% i would add more shells, but that could also just be personal preference. 

5. the fan speeds might need playing with. pla can be tricky, especially in white pla which tends to either print 5 degrees hotter or colder than every other filament (my theory is it has to do with metallic titanium dioxide as the dye agent, but that's a whole other story) you have it on 70% after the first layer, which i think should be fine, but you might try bumping it up and seeing if anything improves or gets worse. 

6. your filament diameters are set to exactly 2.85mm which is the default and rarely exactly matches the actual filament diameter you have, you will want to measure your filament with calipers and adjust that to match. i'd suspect based off the 0.92 extrusion multiplier that you probably have filament in the 2.93 range actually. 

nothing else jumps out at me as being possibly off, and like i said i am not as familiar with simplify3d so those could be normal, but it might be worth at least playing with them to see if they improve anything in a secondary profile perhaps.  your speeds might be a little low, i think they are listed in mm/minute instead of the usual mm/second  if that's correct then you are printing at 60mm/s which may be a little slow. 

hope that helps!"
taz shutting down when wiping nozzle,"hello,
i have a taz 6 that has acquired the habit of power cycling when it gets to the point of wiping the nozzle on the soft pad before printing. it loses memory of what it was doing when it comes back on. this started initially in the midst of a lengthy print, and once i cleared the failed print and tried to start again, it has repeated this strange problem each and every time.

so far, i have reinstalled the default firmware and tried different models that i know to be successful, all with the same result of the machine powercycling at the same point.

any suggestions as to what might be happening?","i'm guessing this is a hardware fault, either the thermistor, heater core, board, or a bed short. i'm thinking its the thermistor or the board because the failure is either occurring just after the heat change for wiping, or on the start of y motion. if you are under warranty you should call in."

repeated trouble with leveling taz 6,"hi,

i'm using a taz 6 with simplify 3d for slicing.

i'm getting a very high failure rate during the leveling process, either it fails entirely or simply prints the first layer too thin or uneven (stepped).

i can see the print head fail to recognize when it comes in contact with the leveling pads (the head presses down on the pad rathe than just lightly touching it). i have checked what i believe to be the connections to the print head and the plate and they are not noticeably loose.

any tips on using simplify 3d successfully?

-- dave","i don't think the problem you are describing is a function of the slicer. given that you have a taz 6 specific start code and end code in simplify3d, all of the auto-leveling is controlled by one gcode command, g29.

curale is open source. it contains the latest firmware for the taz 6 and all of the lulzbot tool heads so you probably want a copy anyway.

i'd suggest taking a simple .stl file (like a 10x10x10 cube) and slicing it with both simplify3d and curale. take a look at the output and see where the differences are. i'm guessing that the differences are minor and both will exhibit the same problem with auto-leveling.

i use curale, simplify3d, and kisslicer depending on the part. i have a dual extruder v3 as well as the original single extruder.

i have a version of the start code supplied with curale modified to use simplify3d's parameter substitution which i have attached. note that as configured, both the cura and the s3d start code make use of the triple wide wiper pad supplied with the dual extruder v3. the wipe section of the start code will need to be replaced with the single wide wiper pad if that's what you have (the gcode for the single wide is included in the .zip file)."

dual extruder v3 connector wont fit,"hi everyone 

i got a dual extruder v3 and i tried to connect the rightmost connector i realised it won't fit. i don't know what to do.  the cable coming from the rambo has 2 pins and the connector from the extruder (right side) has a pin where it looks like it should be open (to receive the pin from the cable from the rambo) - it's the third spot from the right on the back row.






dftba,
peeweejedi","the dual extruder v3 needs two connectors. did you add the cable for the second extruder that came with it? (hopefully, you didn't replace the original with the one in the box).

as you are looking at the front of the taz, the cable with two pins should be on the left and the original cable with no pins should be on the right. both connectors on the tool head have pins but the empty spots are different so you can't plug them into the wrong spot. when you attach the tool head to the printer, i don't think its possible to cross connect the cables as they aren't long enough.

taz 5: motor stops spinning -- no filament being fed to hot end,"hello,

i've got an issue with my taz 5 suddenly.. it'll print about 2mm tall worth of a print then all the sudden the herringbone gear and hobbed bolt stop spinning. i guess for whatever reason the stepper motor stops rotating.

i checked my small herringbone gear and made sure the little screw in the side was tightened.. restarted a print and same issue. i did notice that the small gear was sitting a bit ""cock-eyed"" in relation to the larger gear.. but the teeth were locked together just fine and up until the 2mm point it spins the large gear just fine..

piercet suggested that if it wasn't the small gear then it could be a motor cable short, a failing motor coil or a failing control chip on the rambo board. thus i am going to change the motor cable now since it came with 2 cable and see if it works from there.. i am hoping it's not the latter -- not sure how that gets repaired.

any other suggestions / sanity checks? i added a few pics..

thanks,

erc","it so happened that a long time ago i had printed the replacement herringbone gears (both large and small) in pla. during the print the small herringbone gear was getting enough heat transfer (these were abs prints) from the motor that it would reach a melting point mid print then the motor shaft would basically spin inside the small gear without rotating it. when i would kill the print and cuss the machine it probably cooled back down/re-solidified around the motor shaft and once i started a new print it would work up until the point where it reached melting point again.

moral of the story: don't use pla for any of your extruder head parts! unless it's the idler arm latch or something..

i printed replacement gears in abs on my taz 6, replaced them on the 5 and it's been printing fine now"
dual extruder v3 leveling,"hi,

i am considering to buy the new dual v3 extruder, but i don't know what nozzle leveling really means. is it related to the bed or to the second nozzle?

""the dual extruder v3 does not require nozzle leveling or offset calibration, is lighter and more compact than its predecessor, and features improved heat sink and part cooling.""

thanks
thomas","on any dual extruder with fixed nozzles, the two nozzles need to be at exactly the same height above the bed / part so that the inactive nozzle doesn't collide with the bed / part while the active nozzle is laying down a new layer.

the design of the dual extruder v3 is rigid enough and the two nozzles are close enough together that once leveled (at the factory), there is almost no chance that they will not be level when installed on the printer. 

this assumes that the mounting plate on the printer is level when the dual extruder v3 is installed. on my taz 6, it was not. all i needed to do was loosen the screws holding the bottom plate and tighten them. my v3 has remained level through numerous tool head changes since then.

i believe that if the nozzles are changed or removed to clean a nasty clog, care must be taken to make sure they are still level after installation."

a sudden shift in height where one end of the x axis is higher than the other is often due to a failed or loose z motor coupling. to fix it, first check for broken couplings and tighten all 4 setscrews. once you know they are good, then you can unplug the motor, manually re level the axis, and go from there.  from the bottom of the z lead screw nuts to the top of the lower z lead screw bearing should be the same on both sides.


are the set screws stuck in there? they don't want to budge, at least not with the alankeys that came with it... almost like they're put in there with weldon or locktite."
extruder heatsink fan not spinning,"so... in my months-long on-and-off quest to fix my cs class's taz 5, i think i've finally narrowed down the last issue: the extruder heatsink fan isn't spinning. i believe it's connected to the rambo correctly, and i have just replaced it (because i may or may not have let the magic smoke out of the last one). what are some common issues that might cause the extruder heatsink to not spin?","those fans were pieces of junk. they frequently burned out, and replacements are spendy and still fragile. it's almost certainly the fan itself. it's possible it's the harness or the board or something unplugged, but given the high fan failure rate it's usually the fan itself. if possible, switch to a different style by printing a different carriage and whatnot in abs."
warping later in the print,i've been trying to print a cone shape and when the base is around 3.75 inches in diameter it all stays flat.  when i scale up the size so the base is close to 5.25 inches in diameter it starts lifting up around the outside edge in some places.  will a brim keep that from happening?,"what type of filament?  what slicer software?


a brim should help... try a 5mm (~10 perimeter).  it should seal the first layer better.  increase the initial bed temp a few degrees and print a little hotter for the first few layers.

if using s3d, i like a 5-10mm ooze shield w/brim.  the project stays clean, and the shield blocks air from hitting the first few layers.  brim holds the ooze shield to the bed.  keeps curved surfaces from shrinking also.  a bit of a wasted filament, but worth it so that the project doesn't warp 200 layers in..."
taz 6 external cooling fan(s),"on occasion, i have had to use an additional fan to provide cooling while printing multiple hour long prints with pla. i've been doing so with this fan:






the problem with this arrangement is that the fan is 110v manually controlled by me. if it is on during the initial layer, there's a good chance that it won't stick to the bed and if it isn't on for the upper layers, heat creep or the top layer creeps up until the nozzle hits. since i'm easily distracted, i don't always do my job right 

my solution is to mount two 80x80 12v fans to the frame as pictured below (twice is not my fault). the easiest electrical solution is to wire these two fans in series and then connect them (in parallel) to the existing extruder mounted cooling fan wiring.

is this a viable electrical solution? if not, suggestions are welcome!","only you will be able to tell if that’s a viable solution or not.  seems like a lot of work than simply replacing the middle cooling fan with one that draws in more air.  i agree the stock fan is under powered to cool pla efficiently.

i’ve tried the desktop fan trick with no better results then it not being there.  what did work for me was backing off the tension on the screw on the hobble bolt.  i hit the sweet spot and am able to print pla beyond 1.5 hours without failure.  it’s still a little touch and go though, after several long prints in a row i will get a failure but still much better than what it was before with too much tension on the idler screw.  i will be replacing the always on middle fan with a more powerful one that can move more than 3.x cfm of air."
"taz 6: ""thermal runaway eo"" & ""err: mintemp eo""","hello,

i don't know what the heck is going on becasue my taz 6 worked fantastically before i upgraded to firmware v1.1.5.71.. now mid-print i've received the following errors more than 3x each:

""err: mintemp eo - printer halted - please reset""

and

""thermal runaway eo - printer halted - please reset""

@piercet do you know anything about this??

any help appreciated. hope it's just a bad bug in the new firmware... i totally rebuilt my extruder head and still doesn't work.

erc","a mintemp error happens when your thermistor for one of the hotends is reading 0c or below. this is usually the result of a break in the thermistor wiring, it can also be due to the toolhead not being plugged in or if you are using a dual extruder it can be because the two wiring harnesses for your toolhead got switched around.
thermal runaway is triggered by the primary hotend dropping in temperature beyond a threshhold set in the firmware. it can be caused by a failing heater cartridge or excessive fan on the hotend, or in a worst case scenario, by the thermistor coming out of the toolhead during printing.

since you have experienced both a thermal runaway and mintemp error i would suspect something is going wrong with your thermistor. if you have access to a digital multimeter, you can check the resistance measurements on the tool head to see if the thermistor or heater cartridge is bad. with the printer turned off and unplugged, disconnect the hot end from the wiring harness and test hot end for the proper resistance. the smaller black and red wires coming from the hot end are for the thermistor and should read ~100k ohms at room temperature. the larger red wires are connected to the heater cartridge and should read ~20 ohms."

power supply fan upgrade [tutorial],"if you're like me, you love your taz 4/5. if you're like me, you hate how loud the fans are.

i upgraded the power supply fan to an ultra quiet noctua fan. the result? quiet...

note: the picture links below expired, try this one: https://photos.app.goo.gl/8bkppyffvuwuiry63

fan: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/b009nq ... 1_1&sr=8-1

tools: fan, screw driver, allen/hex wrenches that came with the taz, tweezers, x-acto knife.

**not responsible if you screw up. may void your warranty, blah blah, etc.

incase photos are not showing up, here's a link to them: http://postimg.org/gallery/zhii57ei/

step 1: disassemble the power supply (disconnect from power and ground yourself, obviously)
- remove 12 hex screws: 4 left, 4 right, 4 bottom. pull off the black top cover.

- remove the 2 philips screws holding the fan as well as the small philips screw on the top right of the fan

- lift up the power supply to expose the screws on the left and right (silver part only, leave the black base on the table)
- remove only the screws on the top rows: 3 on the right side, 2 on the left (looking at it from fan side).


- lift away the top case of the power supply to expose the pcb (here comes the fun part, wait for it....) 

step 2: remove the old fan and install the new one
- use tweezers to remove the old fan from the connector. please don't yank it from the wire, it's not the fan's fault it's loud.

- now there might be silicon holding the wire down. i just used my x-acto knife to cut away at both sides of the wire while pulling on the heat shrink part of the wire. do not scrape away at the pcb or you'll cut a trace.

- if you bought the noctua fan i linked above, connect the 3 to 2 pin adapter that was included (b/c noctua is pure awesomeness)

- **important step: the red and back wires on the noctua connector need to be switched. cut off the heatshrink from the end of the noctua fan connector adapter to make it easy. remove the two wires from the jst connector and insert them in reverse order (look at the old fan for reference). refer to the tutorial video (3:45) below for jst connectors
jst tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krvdgix4sk4

- insert the new fan into the connector and nicely route the cable. use 2 of the rubber pins that were included with the fan to mount it into the case (pull it through the holes, takes some force).

- test before putting it all back together (do not touch the power supply when powered and exposed). it takes 5-10 minutes for the fan to kick during a print so be patient and don't freak out like it did
- ??? boom!


tested dozens of prints and did not have any issues. the old fan did not actively cool any components but was used for ventilation. consider adding vibration dampers to your x and y steppers to cut the motor noise in half!

stepper dampers: http://www.ultibots.com/nema-17-damper- ... y17rmdamp/

let me know if you have any questions at all.

good luck!

edit: currently working on replacing the case fan which is a 24v fan which is also insanely loud.","gapdev wrote:i don't suppose you know how much current that 12 volt rail is capable of putting out?

i needed a source of 12 volts for some fans and led's, so i added a 12 volt converter and mounted it to the outside of the control box. if i could get the 12 volts from the power supply, that would be much better.

i bought some 24 volt fans to replace the one in the control box but they were not any quieter so i didn't bother. they weren't noctua fans thought cause, as i recall, i couldn't find one.

kenny

yeah that's exactly what i'm looking for lol. i don't know the current rating of that rail unfortunately 

maybe hook up a dmm in series with an led strip (or something that draws a good amount of current) and monitor the current draw. maybe there's a data sheet for the power supply?

deejayspinz wrote:i've got a mini and the 80mm fan for the rambo is 24v as well.  i'm taking a gamble and getting a 12v noctura and will look at putting a buck converter inline to drop it to 12v.  i understand it's a standard 2 wire fan so before doing it, i want to verify if it also puts out pwm. it's hard to tell if that fan is off/on or variable as the unit prints.   i don't think 24v pwm will play well with a buck converter...  so will do some testing first.

i hear you man! i'm actually trying the same thing with a buck converter! when i hooked up my meter to that fan header, i was reading a duty cycle of about 100%. but if you look at the schematic for the rambo, it's a really weird circuit and i don't quite understand it. if you measure the voltage across the fan headers you will get 12v. but if you use another ground, you get 24v from one of the pins...

so either a buck converter at that fan output or even from a 24v line (that way we can avoid and pwn issues). not sure if the power loss from having a buck would cause other issues though.

keep me posted though and i'll do the same!

proposed dual head with the best of the single head,"the single head v2.1  is a great head.  it works well with all the filaments i have tried including abs.
the curved feed in the v3 dual head causes a lot of trouble for loading, and for feeding abs.

i took a look at retaining all the features of the single head that touch the filament, and packing them as tight as possible.  the two nozzles are 28.76 mm apart.  not as good as the v3 dual head but a lot better then the v2

the hobbled feed shaft is reversed and the inside bearing is still a standard ball bearing but thinner. 

both motors are behind the nozzles one above the other.  this puts most of the weight near the mounting plate.

fans and a lot of fasteners aren't there yet.

the main feed housings are mirror images of one another but the geometry is the same.  

what think you.  thoughts, suggestions.

","that's an interesting setup... keep us posted.  

you may need to work on spacing of the motors and keep an eye on the heat build-up.  also need cooling on the heatsink.

i'm actually pretty impressed with lulzbot v3 setup utilizing the single the common cold side.  while its a bit of problem, the curved compact filament path is innovative."

print warping in right front area,"i was trying to print a large box on my taz 6.   i am using the inland pla from micro center with the polylite for the material selection in cura.  the front right section lifted off the print bed while the rest of the print seemed to lay flat.   what causes this?  i did not apply anything to the print bed before starting.  






is there an issue with the print bed not being uniformly hot?  should i apply the pva glue before printing?  the print came off the bed very easily and smaller thin pieces come loose occasionally during the print process.","well, lots of things cause warping...the warping is caused by the contraction of the plastic as the filament cools.  when the edges lift from the plate, cool air seeps under the print.  so it could be oils on the pei, unlevel bed, cold drafts..

typically it happens at the corners, but could very well lift on any edge.  check that the pei is clean, a little alcohol will clean of any oils from your hands.

try using a 5-10 perimeter brim to help seal the edge... and even if air gets under the print, the brim acts as a buffer to the print.  

or add flat anchor discs at each corner to hold them down.  something like a .3 to .5 thickness shape is easy to remove with minimal post-processing cleanup."
taz 6 dualextv2 - filament jammed in extruder,"hello.

while doing a normal filament change i was unable to pull out the 1.75mm makerbot pla.
i had already done this several times on the taz 6, and 100's of times on our makerbots.
the spring and screws were released on the dual extruder v2, and the led display was prompting that it was ready. but when i pulled a bit harder the pla snapped, and now there is a 2cm piece of pla down in the extruder.
i tried heating up the extruder to 245c and hoped to poke the top of this 2cm piece gently enough that i could gradually force it out. a small amount did come out when i initially heated up the extruder, however it wasn't enough for me to move any of the upper piece that is stuck.
i tried this repeatedly, because i kept getting a heating error and had to keep turning the machine off and starting over...an error that i have reported here: viewtopic.php?f=7&t=7420

so it kept crashing with the heat error, and i kept turning the power on and off and going in and manually heating up the extruder. but even when the heat was stable at around 240c...i could not push the pla through.

any suggestions other than taking the whole thing apart? given the frequent heating issues i'm having with this...it makes more sense to me to start a support ticket than take it apart.

i'm attaching some photos of the broken end of the pla on the spool, and one looking down in to the extruder.
i can just barely see the tip of the piece in the extruder. and the broken end of the pla shows some signs of what is probably heat creep...which i guess is why i've had so many failures due to clogging while testing this new machine the past few days.

here's some links to other forum posts for my reference:
this shows that the 1.75 pla should work fine on a taz 6 imo...if it can work on a taz 5:  viewtopic.php?f=36&t=1793&p=9632&hilit= ... know#p9632
this shows some info on heat creep with pla:
viewtopic.php?f=36&t=7304","first thing i want to mention is that it seems like overall you are working at too high of a temperature. for a 3mm strand of pla we generally recommend extrusion temperatures anywhere between 195 and 205c so for a strand of 1.75 mm you will probably want to stay on the lower end of that to avoid heat creep. pla can carbonize at temperatures over 230 which might be part of why you are having such a difficult time removing the clog from your hotend. based on your description of what you have attempted it does sound like you have already tried most of the techniques recommended to remove a clog aside from taking the extruder apart to access the nub of filament then heating the extruder and removing the filament. the thermal error could be a couple things, the first thing that might be causing it is cold air refracting off the print bed and cooling the nozzle when your auxiliary fans turn on. you can try turning your secondary fans off in cura, or reducing their power to around 20%, or adjusting it so they turn on later in the print if you continue to have issues with the error you may need to take some resistance measurements on your toolhead to check the heater and thermistors are okay."
"filament stuck in printer, wont budge, wont remove","i switched filament today on my taz 6 and after i put it in and pushed it though to get rid of the other filament still inside, the filament became stuck inside even at the recommended polylite pla temperature at 230c. it would not budge and eventually snapped off when i tried pulling it out. when i tried extruding the part which moved the filament just grinded at the filament tube and it would not budge, cleaning the nozzle was no use. what happened and how do i fix it?","beng wrote: ?wed apr 04, 2018 2:15 pm
1.  why does jamming occur after 2 hrs of printing, or ½ hr.?  why not immediately on startup.  what is it during the run time that makes it want to jam.  can cheap filament do that? this sounds like an operating condition that occurs after some period of run time.  what could that be?

2.  one reply forum above seems to indicate excess cooling on the upper part of the hot end freezing the filament.  or is it insufficient cooling on the upper part? if the cooling is the problem, we could change the fan speed controls.

3.  why does it start 2 years down the road?  worked fine for 2 years.  (just started a run for the 4th time.  working fine now.  will see how long it lasts.)


1.&2. sounds like you have the dreaded ""heat creep"". this occurs when the heat from the hot end ""creeps"" up through the heat break into the upper part (cool end). it is caused by insufficient cooling of the upper part. it can be lessened by lowering the temperature (of the hot end / nozzle) or adding additional cooling in the form of an external fan (desktop type). 

when you first start a print, the upper part is cool enough that the filament passing through it says solid. as time goes on the ""heat creep"" causes the upper part to get hot enough that it starts to melt the filament, and some filaments expand as they start to melt which causes a jam (in the hot end, they completely melt).

3. make sure there's no dust in the always-on fan that is cooling the upper part. some compressed air might help here. make sure that fan is spinning like it did when it was new, a 2 year old fan may not spin as fast as when it was new.

it could be the filament depending on the type, age, quality. if you are having jams with pla, pla loves cooling and you can almost never have too much. if you are having jams with abs or some other ""high temperature"" filament, then cooling the upper part without effecting the print becomes trickier. if you are using old filament (i.e. how long since it was purchased), try some newer stuff and see if that helps."
taz 5 flexydually skipping/slipping with ninjaflex,"hello,

i run a small set of printers for a 3d print club at my school.  one of our printers is a taz5 with a flexydually i installed last year.  i've primarily run it for pla as every time i try to run ninjaflex through it, the gears end up skipping and slipping.  (see video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2yy-uxmtyo ) i've tried tightening the tiny hex nut inside the small gear, but it still seems like shortly after beginning a print, the gears just end up spinning back still.  this leads to a bad flow of filament and splotchy, stringy incomplete prints that i usually cancel.

this happens with cura and simplify3d and i've tried raising and lowering the temp and adjusting the speed and the same thing continues to occur.

any advice or tips? it would be great to be able to print some flexible stuff.

thanks in advance for any help!","hey, i have never noticed that happen before.  

i also have a flexdually v2, the only thing i can think of is did you level it correctly?

modified wipe code for other toolheads to use dual v3 wipe pad,"as part of the dual extruder v3 upgrade there is a triple wide wipe pad that replaces the single wipe pad shipped with the taz 6. while you have to insert and remove the z-min stop extension, you do not have to switch the wipe pad when not using the dual v3.

after watching the wipe part of the start gcode for the aerostruder and the original single extruder v2.1, it occurs to me that the wipe part of their start gcode could be rewritten to take advantage of the triple wide wipe pad (and distribute the wiped filament across the whole thing). has anyone undertaken this modification? would anyone be interested in this modification?","i have attached a .zip file which contains the default wipe code (curataz6wipe.gcode) and a modified taz 6 wipe code (curataz6wipe3.gcode) for the single extruder v2.1 and the aerostruder. the modified wipe code uses more of the triple wide pad that is shipped with the dual extruder v3.

warning: do not modify the wipe code for any of the single extruders unless you have the triple wide pad as this modified code will hit the sides of the original single wide pad holder.

the attached files are usable as is. they will zero xy, then z, wipe the nozzle, and quit. however, you probably want to edit the start gcode you are using replacing the lines between the comments ""move above wiper pad"" and ""raise extruder""."
wear on y axis rods,"is anyone else seeing unusual wear on the rods used for the y axis on a taz 6? this taz is about 6 months old and showing wear on the rods. this is also happening on x axis but to a lesser degree. i would have thought lulzbot would have used hardened chrome rods but guess not. we contacted support and they said this is 'normal' and to clean the rods with steel wool, which we did. now they are squeaking. maybe its time for some wd40 .. we have ordered new rods and bearings since this is a production machine and need it to stay up. 
i was just wondering if this is 'normal' and if anyone else has this problem.

larry","i ran my taz 3 rods for a year without issue before i swapped them out for openbuilds rails. if you are seeing wear, check that you didn't end up with one that someone installed ball bearings on, if so you'll want to swap those rods out for hardened ones. the igus bushings lulzbot uses are self lubricating, and will actually react excessively badly to any lubricant you put on the rods. wd-40 would not only eat them over time, it would also gum them up to the point they would become unusuable in short order and start mar-ing your rods.  

if they are visibly rough now, you may want to replace them and your bearings. printer should also still be under warranty though."

dual v3 head not ready for prime time,"beware the dual v3 head! thumbs down!
i bought the dual v3 head for my second taz 6 and have nothing but regrets. nozzle 2 has the known thermistor wonky connection problem, so temperatures are reported all over the map, causing wrong temperatures to be generated in the hot end. after 3 days of wondering why prints kept failing and temperature warnings kept halting prints, i finally noticed the reported temps on the lcd were hoping around like crazy, varying from 170º to 250ºc. no wonder the hot end was confused. so after wasting 3 days i decided to send the v3 back for a refund. then i found out that the return policy at lulzbot says they charge a 15% ""restocking"" fee, whatever the hell that means. i'm pissed because that means i will have paid $74.25 (15% of $495) plus insured return shipping of $25.50 for a total of $99.75 just to try out a defective piece of experimental crap that wasted three days of my time. they sent me an empty and worthless apology for their return policy, taking into account no consideration that their print head was defective from the start. i wouldn't have the nerve to treat my customers like that, but the difference is i stand behind my products 100% and aleph objects doesn't. instead, they profit from defective returns. $100 down the drain! and three days of wasted time.

i have bought two taz 6 printers and one lulzbot mini. my next printer will not be coming from lulzbot as a result of their treatment.

it doesn't make matters any better that cura 2.6.66 is by far the worst piece of software i've ever encountered. the gui fails to refresh the screen practically every time you make a little change to the settings, that is, when it doesn't just totally crash. 

i should have known better than to buy a newly developed and apparently under-tested piece of hardware before there's been time to work the bugs out.","funny... i just ran into the thermistor problem after 2-3mo of good use.  using pliers to squeeze the crimps on the thermistor pins seemed to have solved my issues for the time being... a bit of solder might be more reliable, but i remember some tidbit about not soldering the thermistor wires...

probably not the best place to put this guide, but a quick guide on getting to the pins:
- turn-off machine, disconnect main toolhead connector.  
- cut the zip-tie and remove the wire loom
- disconnect the thermistor connector (molex)
- use a pin / dental pick to press in the the silver dot in the middle of connector housing
- slide out 1st pin
- use pliers to squeeze the sides of the second set of crimps (the first tiny crimps are to grip the insulation). give it a second squeeze for a better chance at making good contact.
- insert the pin into housing.  give it a little tug to make sure the pin is securely in the housing.
- if it doesn't stay in the connector, remove the pin and give the little metal tab (between crimp and pin) a slight lift.  use pliers and a pin or dental pick to push the pin into the connector housing until the tab reseats.
- repeat above for the 2nd pin.
- reconnect to the extruder wiring, zip tie the loom back up, and connect toolhead.


the thermistors look to be different from the e3d cartridge versions... so hoping this holds up until they get more thermistors into the store.  might consider modifying firmware for the e3d thermistor cartridge which looks easier to source."
broke heat break when trying to change nozzle on aerostruder,"we recently got a taz 6 with all the bells and whistles for work.  a co-worker tried to swap out the default aerostruder nozzle for a 3dxtech a2 steel nozzle so we can try printing carbon-fiber loaded filaments.  he was following the e3d instructions (as the lulzbot instructions for changing the nozzle don't seem to be available yet).

he ended up snapping off the heat break when he tried to rotate the heater block half a turn to loosen the heat break.  is the construction of the lulzbot aerostruder somehow different than the e3d titan aero that the instructions should be followed differently?

is the extra expense for the titanium heat break over the stainless ones worth it?

hmm... shouldn't have to rotate the heat block or heat break to change the nozzle.  

the heat block needs a wrench to hold stationary, then a second wrench to remove the nozzle.  heat the block and nozzle to 185c+ to liquefy the filament.

that makes sense to me.

i think he was going from these instructions:

filament feed failure,"i have a pretty new taz 6 and i'm having problems with the filament feed.  the last four prints, at some point the filament won't feed through the extruder properly and will instead just get chewed up by the toothed wheel meant to move it along.  at first i thought the issue might be too much resistance going through the stock feeder tube, so i moved the filament spool on top of the printer with a dowel balanced across the top.  it seems like there is not much resistance in this configuration, and yet, it still failed at some point towards the end of the print (about an hour in).  i've tried tightening the screws that clamp it in there, but to no avail.

i'm getting tired of wasting time and filament on failed prints.  any suggestions for me?","ehoff wrote: ?fri mar 09, 2018 9:21 am
heat creep is when the heat from the hotend travels up the break.  this causes the filament to soften near the hobbed bolt and makes it so the teeth on the hobbed bolt start chewing into the filament, rather than feeding it into the extruder.  if you have a bite mark on the filament when you unload it from the extruder, you most likely have heat creep going on.  pla is affected by heat creep do to the thermal properties of the filament itself. it likes cooler temperatures, rather than warm temperatures, so it softens quicker than other types of filaments.

one thing we've come to find about heat creep, is if you set up a small desk fan blowing across the hotend, it helps prevent heat creep.

when you adjust your thumb screws at the ilder latch, we recommend leaving a 5mm gap between the washers where the spring fits.  chrisbap, you are correct on the pair of screws to tighten.


thanks for the explanation.  it sounds like this may be the case then.  when it fails and i extract the filament, i can see the teeth marks down the length of it, plus (usually) a chewed up spot where the hobbed bolt was spinning against it.  i use the included small metal brush and/or the metal pick to clean out the teeth, and clip off the damaged part of the filament before reinserting it and restarting printing.  this generally solves the problem until it (eventually) fails again.

good to know about the screw adjustment distance, i will pay attention to that going forward.  my screws are pretty close to 5mm now (when it most recently failed) but i can't say for sure what they were at on all occasions.  not too far off is my guess, maybe on the looser side for the early failures.

i will try your suggestion of setting up a desk fan for my next print although finding a good location for that may be tricky."
cant level flexydually tool head v2 halp!!!!!!,"i have a taz 5 with up graded 12mm x-axis rails. i upgraded to 12mm because the 10mm were taking a beating when i would use the flexydually tool head v2. whe i connect the flexydually im getting an insane amount of sag on the front of the tool head. the height adjustment bolt is bottumed out, and the front extruder head is still dragging on the print bed. there is way too much weight sitting up front. how can i fix/correct this, or is there a mod i can print that will support more weight than the stock flexy extruder mount?","this seems to be the closest forum topic, despite being a few years old - i apologize in advance.

new taz6, brand new flexydually v2. fully mounted, remains loose in the ""v"" hanger.

able to nudge the entire head, by gently lifting the front edge, a couple mm, as if the ledge lip is too big, or the head catch is too small, or they are not matching in their profile.there is too much ""play"" in the mount.

i feel that the head should be snug and not move, even a little but, independently from the mount, nestled in and torqued properly.

speed,"hello fellow taz users,

i have a question, when i had a 350 dollar xyz printer , it would print 5 times faster than my taz6, what is the highest speed possible without hurting the print???
do i have to adjust it everytime while printing in tune or can i set the software to make it print faster, like i said the xyz printer would print a object in 2 hours and the same one will take 5 hours????

any help much appreciated","a bigger nozzle will allow thicker layers and reduce print time (and resolution.) however there are some caveats and limits to how big you might want to make the nozzle.

the moarstruder has a 1.2mm nozzle and a longer heater block to support the extra volume of melted plastic its speed requires. i suspect/guess that a 1.4mm nozzle if you could find one would outpace the stock heater block at normal print speeds let alone high ones. (a theoretical 1.4mm nozzle would put out 7.84x the volume of .5mm nozzle, a huge difference..1.2mm is ""just"" 5.76x and they changed the hot end design.)

the speed referenced by piercet above was for the overall motion system (x/y). this is related to but distinct from the layer height and amount of plastic per unit time. 

based on your comments so far, it isn't clear that you have tried the advice of adjusting the speeds in the slicer. have you? you referenced doing this, but i don't know if you were able to reach suitable print speed with the knob after the print starts? i have found that this method works at least when printing from sd card but i didn't test it since switching to octoprint.

if despite this you do get such a nozzle and slap it on there, please post an update or video because i would be interested to see it. i've never tried something like that myself. (though i do have a moarstruder.)"
what causes unexpected printer pause?,"hello all,

first time poster.  i tried searching archives for similar question, but couldn't find an answer.  perhaps i am using incorrect terms.

on most of my prints, occasionally the print head will just stop moving for 10 sec, 30 sec, or perhaps longer.  during this time, i can't see that it is doing anything.  the head temp will be at target goal.  then, suddenly the print will continue.  does anyone know what causes this?

the reason it is a problem is because filament will continue to ooze out of the hot end.  and when the print head eventually moves on, it leaves behind a blob of extra filament.  and the next many millimeters ""downstream"" are under-extruded, because that amount of filament already leaked out.  see photo showing how the blob ruins a gear (unless i can successfully trim the excess off)







i am printing from a mac via usb.  could this be that the communication stream from the mac was interrupted for some reason?  it would seem odd to me that there would be such a long delay.  how would i go about tracking this down?  has anyone else experienced this?

thanks
kevin toppenberg","yes, i use an old laptop running ubuntu to control my 'mini, and i get these as well.  i can cause the pauses by slicing a model when my 'mini is printing.

the problem in my case is that the laptop is too busy doing other things to send more gcode to the 'mini, so the 'mini just sits there waiting for new instructions.  i can make the problem go away by not running any other programs but cura 2 while the 'mini is printing.

since you have a taz 6, you can print via sd card.  try disconnecting your laptop, slicing your model, save it to sd, and then print without your laptop.  this should get rid of the pauses.

if you want to stay tethered, are handy with linux and have a spare computer, you can install ubuntu and cura 2.  an issue with free software like cura is that the developers usually work in linux and wonky things can happen when they translate the code over to windows or mac.  the linux versions are typically much more stable.

taz 5 for printing tpu.  aero or dual v3?,"hey guys,

i'm trying to decide between getting the aero or the dual v3 for printing both hips and tpu on a taz 4 turned into the 5.  i have a project coming up soon that needs the best tpu parts possible that look pretty (minimal stringing, ringing ect)  i already have pulled the trigger on a the new modular bed system, but i was wondering what you guys think will give better results?

currently running a flexy on a mini, and a og flex on the taz 4/5 so im thinking either will be pretty awesome.

thanks!","i'll preface this that i don't have experience with tpu, but i have successfully printed pla, abs, hips, petg and nylon, as well as specialty filaments from taulman, 3dxtech and polymaker.

to avoid stringing, dial in your retraction settings.  here is a good retraction test print:
https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:909901

start printing with your default settings.  if you get stringing, increase your retraction distance (under material in cura 2).  typical settings are between 0.5 mm and 1.0 mm, but might be a bit higher with tpu (guessing it is a bit gooey like petg).  don't increase your retraction distance too far, then you can get blobbing when the extruder re-pressurizes the nozzle as it starts the next section of print.  the ""goldilocks"" setting for most materials is the distance just far enough that it stops stringing so that you can maximize your print speed.  also check your retraction speed, for higher quality i have it between 5 and 10 mm/s  (also because the cura default pla setting of 24 mm/s was grinding my filament).

as kcchen said, slow down (although going too slow can cause problems too).  ringing is caused by the belts having to stop and start the mass of the toolhead.  since the effect is on the outside of the print, the critical setting is outer wall speed (under speed in cura 2).  you can try 10 mm/s or perhaps as slow as 5 mm/s.  here's a ringing test print (i haven't tried it myself however):
https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:678295

fan settings will also affect print quality:  more fan for better part accuracy, less for stronger parts and it's strongly dependent on material (pla loves fans, abs hates them).  again, i'm not sure how tpu will behave, gotta find that ""goldilocks"" zone.  in theory, the aerostruder will make for more uniform parts because of the fan shroud, i notice that one side of my prints turns out better than the other on my 'mini because the hexagon toolhead only has one directional fan.

you might consider the new water-soluble pva support materials such as polydissolve s1 over hips.  water seems easier to use and the results seem better than limonene (watching co-workers do some dual-prints with soluble support, not sure if tpu plays better with hips or pva):
https://www.lulzbot.com/store/filament/polydissolve-s1

we haven't had the best of luck printing with the dual v3 yet, but haven't spent the time hashing out the processes either.  it might be that simplify3d is better than cura 2 for processing dual prints.  the general consensus is to avoid the headaches of dual printing if at all possible and use breakaway support, but it might not be practical with tpu.

it's all process development as you try to get the most out of your machine and filament.  having a collection of good test prints will help you characterize your process and make the best quality prints (or trade-off quality for speed, etc.)  good luck, and please post pictures of your results on the forum!"
use v2 dule extruder head parts for a diferent head?,"i am planning on selling my v2 duel extrusion head.  before i do, a question.  are there enough parts in there that i should save it to rebuild into something else.  some day i would like a lulzbot taz flexystruder tool head v2 with the all metal hot head.   could i print some parts and build one from my v2?

thanks all","sure.  all you need is to print the extruder body and swap the nozzle to a .6mm.

before you print the flexystruder body, search the forums or thingiverse for modified extruder bodies which work with semiflex filaments.  no extra tubing required.  typically these modified extruders have a tighter filament path tolerance after the hobbed bolt preventing the softer filament from escaping the path or getting sucked into the hobbed bolt."
odd behavior of plastic while bridging,"

this is done with ngen plastic. bridging is done at 5mm/sec. layer height is 0.4mm, and the bridge is 20mm.
this was sliced with slic3r

things to watch for:
there appears to be a bug in slic3r where it extrudes while moving the print head to the next level. this is the cause of the strings on the left pillar.
note the shape of the extruded line on the 1st layer of the bridge, how it seems to bend up above the height it is being extruded at.
note that the shape of the extruded line is not stable, sometimes the ark of the filament collapses causing lumps in the layer.
note that the 1st layer is nearly level until the 2nd layer of the bridge is put down, then it starts to sag.

i noticed when the fans are on during the bridging, the temperature of the print head drops about 5 degrees. i'm thinking of insulating the print head to protect it from the cooling effect of the fans. it looks to me like the primary direction of the stock fan vents aims a bit too low. i intend to redesign the fan ducts to direct the air directly at the tip of the extruder.

these parameters are not ideal for bridging, but they show the odd behavior of the plastic. i originally thought that the plastic was adhering to the outside of the print nozzle, but the video clearly shows it is curving up without touching the outside of the nozzle.
i think part of the problem with the sagging is that slic3r shuts off the cooling fans for the second and later layers. i think this may allow radiant heat from the head to soften the previously printed bridge.

i apologize for the really shallow depth of field in this video. next time i'll try and get more light on the subject, and i may try a telephoto lens with the camera further away to see if i can get more of the object in focus.","that is good bridging.  i would expect a 20mm span requiring supports.

your expectations for printing in mid-air may be a little high...   each time the nozzle or new extrusion touches the bridged layer is a chance for deformation.  a slight decrease in extrusion temp could help, just be careful of poor adhesion to the previous layer.  as always, stay within the filament manufacturer's suggested temp ranges.

check if slic3r has a setting for ""wipe"" at the end of a layer or retract when crossing spaces.  this may help the stringing at the left post. lowering extrusion temps could also help."

interlayer bonding issue with taz 6,"hi,
we recently bought a taz 6 printer and initially it printed well however we had a minor issue on our last print where a part of the print cracked during use but it looked like it cracked along between two layers as though the layers had not adhered properly (see photo) other cracks are also visible. i assume that this is a settings issue (nozzle temp? print speed?). 

the settings used are the recommended settings for pla (village plastics) using the high speed profile however we use esun (who recommend a temperature range of 205 - 225 as opposed to the default 195 for village plastics pla). there is no inbuilt profile for esun or other generic pla filaments.

any help with this is much appreciated.

cheers.","hi,
and thanks for all the replies. much appreciated.

i tried a higher temp (205 degrees vs the default of 195) and this made a huge improvement but i think i will also take the advice of @doenute and try reducing the layer height as well (currently 0.38mm - default for high speed profile).

i will report back on how things go.

thanks for all the help.

dual extruder v2 heat block fan upgrade,"like many here, i was having significant difficulty in getting reliable prints in pla, due to filament jamming caused by heat creep.  after much consultation with others on this forum, and lots of experimentation on my own, i have concluded that the stock miniature blowers are just not adequate.  the following upgrade appears to have completely solved my pla heat creep issue.

i located a 20mm 5v fan that has nearly three times the airflow of the stock blower:

http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/e ... nd/2757793

i designed a shroud to concentrate the airflow on the heat block.  i also designed a mounting clip, making it reversible to allow some flexibility in the mounting location.  i printed both of these parts in abs, and here's what they look like, along with the fan:





the holes in face of the shroud are sized to be tapped for 2-56 screws.

i added a layer of copper foil on the surface nearest the heater block, just for good measure:






here's how i have them installed on my dual head v2:






i replaced one of the extruder bolts, the one underneath the stepper motor, using an m4 x 35mm machine screw with a 7mm hex head.  this also solves the annoying problem of trying to hold the extruder mounting nut in place during reassembly.  underneath the fan mounting clip is a 6mm tall spacer with a 4mm clearance hole.  the screw comes down through the spacer, through the clip, and another nut goes on the end to hold it all together and hold the extruder down.  i printed the clip at 100% infill so that it could withstand the force needed for that task.

i had originally intended to place the fans both on the same side of the head, which is why i made the clip reversible.  however, i found that it works better for me as shown, with the fans diagonally opposed, mainly because in these locations the shrouds don't interfere with the thermistor wires.  in light of this, the clip could be re-designed to make it non-reversible, and extended to eliminate the need for the through-hole spacer.  i may get to that...

everything just barely fits, with very little room to spare!  i have not tried, but i believe this design may also work on the single head.

there is about a 2mm gap between the bottom of the shroud (copper foil side) and the top of the heater block.  there is no sign of the shrouds melting or discoloring as of yet, after many hours of printing pla at 205c with a 60c bed.  i still need to do a ""torture test"", setting the nozzles to 240c and the bed to 110c and lowering the head down to the bed and just letting it sit.  hopefully the shrouds will withstand this.

here's the whole thing put back together:





i have attached stl files for both parts.","kelvarnson wrote:mizunoslove wrote:
thanks for responding to the post. i know posting on such a big forum we can get lost in the crowd sometimes.

no worries.  i was pulling my hair out a year ago trying to fix the heat creep problem with pla, so i can certainly understand the frustration.  i will try to check consistently.

i think even if the rear shroud is cracked or compromised, it should still be much better than stock.

something else just occurred to me also.  before i came up with the heatsink shroud design, i did a modification to the actual extruder body, putting the same 5 volt micro fan on it, and directing air through channels adjacent to the filament and out of the bottom (details here: viewtopic.php?f=29&t=4200 )

that approach was only partially successful, but when i installed the current fix, i did not remove the fan from the rear extruder body 

so, my rear extruder also has a fan running in the body of it (i never installed it on the front one).  is the current shroud and fan fix working for pla on your front extruder, but not the rear?  i wonder if i am still getting some benefit from that extruder body fan.  i have done 99% of my printing on that extruder.  the few jobs that i did use pla in the front extruder (without the body fan) did work, though.

so i looked at my head tonight and everything looks fine. but i decided i would take pictures of it and post them. maybe you'll see an issue i didn't notice.  before i found your post i did design a fan shroud that would use the cooling fans but i wasn't successful with it. maybe the combination of the two mods will work together... i'm posting pictures of the fan mod as well."
broken nozzle,"i have a fairly new taz5.  i switched from abs to petg, forgot to change the diameter of the filament, it clogged, and overextruded the tip right off the nozzle (it broke off).  now the remainder of the nozzle (the threads) appears to be stuck inside the hot end surrounded by a mass of hardened petg.

is there any hope for recovery?  i had though maybe soaking the whole hot end in a mix of acetone and this other cement solvent  (methyline chloride?) i have for an extended period.  before i do it, i need to know whether i should remove the aluminum part of the hotend and what the ramifications of doing so are.  never had it apart so i don't want to screw something up.

i noticed they use some type of locktite on the threads for the hotend.  is that a special hi temp type?","wmgeorge64 wrote:been around metals and metalworking nearly all my life, there is no way a stepper motor extruder pushing plastic into a brass nozzle can break it.  it was not machined correctly.

if you dig through the hexagon files on devel.lulzbot.com, you will find some documentation about this problem. 

the problems is that the aluminum heater block expands when it warms up. that expansion puts pressure on the brass nozzle. if the nozzle has been over tightened on instalation, the additional stress created by the heater block expansion causes a crack to form in the nozzle. as the nozzle is heat cycled for prints, the crack grows until the nozzle is weak enough to fail completely. 

this failure is, or at least was in the past, covered by warranty. 

if you need to change nozzles, i recommend you buy a 7mm crowfoot and a torque wrench. otherwise you will be periodically replacing nozzles and heater blocks. 

my crowfoot will arrive tuesday!"
filament sticking to nozzle on first layer,"i've had a taz 6 since november and have gotten some great prints with it. i love not having to manually level the bed or clean the nozzle, but my one constant frustration has been with the fail rate of the first layer.

i find whenever i'm starting a print i have to do 3-4 attempts before getting a successful first layer (actually on starting my 6th attempt on a print right now, but 3-4 is average), whether i'm using ngen, hips, polylite pla, or a few other sample filaments i've tried out. either the filament just creates a blob around the nozzle not sticking at all, or it will stick to the bed but the loose end is stuck to the nozzle so as it moves it pulls the filament up and i'm frantically trying to cut it free.

i'm just not sure whether i'm doing something wrong or if that's just the way it goes with these printers. before my taz 6 i was using a makerbot replicator 2, and there were definitely a lot more headaches with it, but i was really hoping the taz would be a bit more reliable than it's been so i could focus on designing things rather than hovering over my printer to make sure it works properly.","i hv been having similar issues as the ones described here.
-the first issue i had was bed leveling.  the nozzle was dirty and when the taz executed the wiping and probing, there was excess pressure which cased slight deflection on the bed, causing the nozzle to be too close to the bed impacting material flow.  to fix this i now raise the extruder, heat up the nozzle, with a leather glove clean the head and rub with a non-conducive scotch britte to clean it.  with this, the nozzie just lightly touches the contacts in each corner and keeps an acceptable distance to the bed not to impact material flow.
-2nd issue was that i was using a low temp for the material.  i'm too inexperienced here.  what i did was to load the material on the extruder, heat up the head to 190 degrees... go to movement/extruder and push some material through the nozzle.  i kept raising the temp and pushing material till i got a good flow of material.  that was the temp i used for the next run.
-3rd issue was the first layer settings.  experimenting, with some friends help and watching videos i did the following changes:  moved the first layer speed to 50% (more time to extrude that initial critical layer), increase the skirt lines from 1 to 3 (more time to prime the nozzle), cut the fan to 0% for the first layer (less impact on temp), raised temp for the first 2 layers +5 degrees above the rest.  with this i got good priming on the nozzle prior to start printing and a slower/higher quality first layer.

after doing 1-3 i run a test on a bluetape and i got a great print.

now onto the bed/pei:
due to the adherence issues, i followed the recommendations to clean the pei.  using a mix of 1:9 isop alcohol/water mix, wet the bed and sand with 1500-2000 grit (lulzbot tech team recommendation).  sand thoroughly and clean again with the same solution.  i did this yesterday after my print and i'm going to try a new print today now on the pei and not on the blue tape.  will report back.  a few days ago my pei was showing a ton of bubbles, i'm wondering if that's the issue.  my machine is basically new, i hv run just 4 prints total... 

will write back after testing the pei today."

it is fw 1.1.5.70, so after leveling, the table goes away from the head and it extrudes some filament off the edge, not sure if that is unique to the head rev of the fw or the current fw rev, my earlier fw rev single did not do that.

any ideas?","b-morgan wrote: ?sun mar 18, 2018 3:45 pm
the reason why e2 (t1) doesn't purge is because marlin does not maintain current e for each extruder, only a global e value.

at the beginning of the start gcode, t0 and t1 are set to 0 (g92 e0) and then retracted -15 (g1 e-15 f100). (global e is -15) 

after ""m117 purging..."",
t0 is moved to e0, set to e-15, and moved to e0. this works because global e is -15 from above.
t1 is selected and moved to e0 but wait, it is already there because of the global e value being set last by t0! marlin needs to be told that t1 is at e-15 first! solution, add another ""g92 e-15"" after ""t1"".

the purging section of the start gcode should be:
code: select allm117 purging...              ; lcd status message
t0                           ; select this extruder first

1. first please raise your tool head off of the bed. if it already off of the bed, go to the next step. if the z motors are bound up and will not allow you to move the z axis up, then please turn off the printer and manually turn the silver couplers (that attach the z axis motors to the threaded rods), until the head is high enough off of the heat bed to do a measurement.

2. then measure from the top metal frame to the top of the x carriage guide rails. if either side you measure is higher than the other disable your stepper motors from the lcd display, or through the ""motors off"" in cura. then adjust the side that is higher to be equal to the other side. you can do this by turning the silver couplers that attach the motors to the threaded rods, you'll find them inside the green housings at the bottom of each threaded rod.

3. there is also 2 screws on the z carriage idler and the z carriage motor, that will need adjustment. please follow the guide rails that the tool head is mounted on, to the assemblies that holds them in place. you will find 2 4mm allen head screws that hold the assemblies to the threaded rods. please loosen these 2 allen head screws on the left and the right.

4. after this you will need to auto home the printer.

5. then move the z axis to close to the top of the printer using cura (245mm from home) or using the lcd display (movement > move axis > move 1mm > move z). then auto home the printer again. please do this two times bottom to top and back. then please move the z axis to the middle of the printer. once you have the x carriage in the middle of the printer, re-tighten the 4 allen head screws connected to the z nut mounts on each side.

do not over tighten the allen head screws. once this is completed, run another print and see if the z binding is decreased."
four screws holding the control box to the frame,"hi all,

heya!

i recently developed the twoolhead for this exact scenario and it's completely open source! the ""duplication mode"" in the stock firmware seems to be broken, so i had a friend help me make a custom version in order to do exactly what you're asking. i've got versions for the taz 5 and 6 that should work for you if you're using the hardware for a lulzbot v1 or v2 dual electronics, here are links to the firmware: taz 5 & taz 6

the twoolhead has it's nozzles spaced 140mm apart in x in order to get the maximum build volume out of both nozzles, but it should work with a regular dual extruder if you're only printing parts less than 50mm long.

hope that helps, please let me know if you have questions about getting it working

cheers

as mentioned above, dont write offsets to the machine, just set them in the tool params and apply to gcode.

taz5 igus replacement on y,"hey there. i was wondering what the expected lifetime of the igus would be on the taz 5? yesterday i was in the hackerspace, and noticed that whenever the bed was changing directions, it'd tip around the diagonal as shown in this image: 

it seems there's a lot of slop in the two marked igus bearings.

i was wondering what the lifetime of a replacement set would be, and if a linear ball bearing would last longer?

i'm also curious if it's 10mm rods, i'm not at the printer currently. 

thanks for the help ","the quick answer is ""it depends"" if you are using that printer constantly at high speeds daily it may only last a couple of years. if someone did something less than ideal like try and lubricate the rods causing them to gunk up and abrade the bearings, maybe months. the rods are 10mm. a 12mm retrofit project does exist, i don't know if anyone ever tried it though. https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1549505 

a better alternative would be this one: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1038673"
changing nozzle,"i have read different posts here and other places, on changing the nozzle head. i have a new one i want to put on, however, i cannot free u the existing nozzle. i have tried it while hot, warm, cool, etc. to no avail. i do not want to break the head, so i am leary to go any further. it's a taz 6. ideas??","i use a 7mm open end wrench and a 18 or 19mm wrench to hold the heater block that the nozzle threads into.  the nozzle only has 2 flat sides so you have to use an open end wrench and not a box end as the box end won't fit.  i heat up the extruder from 200 to 230 degrees celsius, then turn off the printer (you may cause damage if you put something metal or wet on the nozzle while its powered on).  once off i put the new nozzle on until its snug, heat up the extruder to about 260 degrees celsius and give it a little tug on the tightness.  i think its supposed to be about 30 in. lbs but since i couldn't get a socket on it i never could use my torque wrench .  remember right is tight and left is loose.

"silicone heater, is not recognized by the printer","hello everyone

 i had to remove the thermistor because it burned, i replaced it with a new one from the same brand (100k honeywell thermistor), after connecting the silicone heater again, the printer does not detect the temperature of the bed.

 any idea what might be happening?

 thanks!!","hello

that's the correct thermistor so the issue could be elsewhere on the printer. open the control box (where the rambo is located) and see if there is any issues with the wires. you'll want to check the purple ones coming from the connector for the bed. also, be sure to check to see if you see any issues with the components on the rambo board itself.

bought a used taz6  what to check / adjust?,"i just bought a used taz 6 with the single head and a v3 duel head. it is in shipping right now.  i have been 3d printing for years but this is my first lulzbot.

i plan to go through it like i was setting up a new machine but are there particular things i should be checking, adjusting, tightening, etc.

i saw the note on the thermister and will check that first,  the previous owner said he never got the duel head to work right.  

thanks.","if he said he has never gotten the v3 dual head to print right he probably ain't lying!  i can say the same thing.  i bought my taz 6 on last years black friday special and also bought the new dual v3 print head.  i never could get it to print correctly either.  i thought it was the cheaper esun pva filament i bought, even though i bought it from lulzbot themselves.  there were times i thought i seen the temperature fluctuate around on the 2nd extruder but if i wiggled the wires on the connections the temperature monitor readings wouldn't fluctuate.  then they recently (2/22/18) came out with a service bulletin regarding the v3 dual head and the new aerostruder tool head.  my serial number fell within the affected range, so i sent it back to lulzbot and they replaced the hot end for quality assurance just to be sure.  just yesterday i made several prints with the dual head using the esun pva material and it worked successfully!  so my advice to you is to check the service bulletin and see if the v3 dual head you bought is one of the affected ones.
https://www.lulzbot.com/content/service-bulletins

before my taz6 i owned a mini.  quality was good and was pretty reliable so i decided to go the next level to the taz6.  unfortunately at that time lulzbot also decided to go with an entire new software platform for their free cura lulzbot edition.  riddled with bugs!  the old software was much better and more reliable.  however, at this point in time it does seem that they have worked a lot of the bugs out and is once again beginning to be much more reliable.  the software developers have plenty to keep them busy and are working hard on working out all the bugs.  i've submitted a few to make the software better for all of us.  as of this writing the current recommended version is 2.6.69.  that's been the recommended version for approximately 2 months now and its been pretty solid.  i'm expect a major version to come out soon.  3.x.x.  i cannot comment on simplyfy3d software cause i have never used it.  $150 for slicer software is just too much for me when the free version seems to be doing everything i need it to do!  good luck with your new taz 6 printer, i think you bought a good 3d fdm printer!

dual extruder v3 'heating failed e1',"our dual extruder v3 is fresh out of the box and, after three days, we still haven't even been able to make it all the way through the test print yet. i was given the runaround and a list of pointless things to try from the support staff (which i tried for their sake), but the problem persists. has anyone else encountered this error? it occurs regardless of whether i use cura (2.6.66) or octoprint, and it occurs when using either marlin 1.1.5.70 or 1.1.5.71.

is there anyone familiar with such an issue with the dual v3 that could provide some useful guidance? i am growing weary of wasting time and filament on the redundant and irrelevant tests that support keeps stringing me along with. 

plz halp! can haz cheeseburger?","after receiving a new unit via rush rma, i am thoroughly disappointed to report that it has the same exact problem and i have been given the same exact responses from support. they even sent me a clearly used replacement unit (for my brand new one) with heaters of two different lengths (one of which was obviously used and scratched up), a retention bracket that wasn't tightened at all, and two different styles of nozzle (both clearly used as well). it is becoming abundantly clear that there are widespread manufacturing defects, incredibly poor quality control and an utter lack of any semblance of honesty from support. they just give you the runaround, tell you to do the same boilerplate nonsense (which never works) and then give you the option of doing another rma or trying to fix their manufacturing defects yourself at the potential cost of voiding the warranty if anything goes wrong during the repair process (or, more likely, if you try it at all and it doesn't work after following their steps). this is just disingenuous, dishonest and a terrible way to do business.

thankfully, we have a flexydually v2 that works perfectly, so we're not at a complete standstill, but we have wasted days on troubleshooting defective units. i didn't pay to be a beta tester for a product that is clearly not production ready, but that's certainly what i received for my $495. 

i would encourage anyone considering purchasing the dual extruder v3 to save their money, as all this will bring you is wasted time and an infuriating experience with a support staff that seems to have been instructed to take no responsibility whatsoever for a known problem with their hardware, even when it is brand new and cannot even complete the test print. if one unit was faulty, i understand. but sending me another faulty unit with the same problem (this time a clearly used one that had been poorly refurbished) and then giving me the same responses as before is insulting, infuriating and absolutely unprofessional in every conceivable manner. if you are a masochist and you like that sort of thing, you would still be better off paying someone $495 to hit you in the nuts repeatedly while screaming ""stop hitting yourself."""
arranging the print bed,"i'm new with the taz 6, so excuse what might be an ignorant question. when you guys print multiple parts in a run, how do you arrange the bed? do you keep the parts close together or do you use as much of the bed as possible?

saturday night, i printed 4 parts in abs. i took no particular care arranging them on the bed (other than getting the side of each i wanted down to be flat on the bed). they came out perfect.

sunday night, i printed the exact same 4 parts. this time, i thought to myself i can save the printer some needless travel if i bunch the parts close together. this time, two of the parts sort of ""drooped"". not enough to be unusable for my purposes, but not the perfection i saw saturday. some of the straight edges aren't straight, and a few sides are bulging.

two variables changed. (1)the arrangement of the parts, and (2)the temperature in my shop was warmer sunday than saturday. i didn't measure the temps, but it seemed much warmer. any educated guesses on which if either might have been the problem?

as you didn't have this issue with the objects farther apart, it makes me suspect over-heating. by moving them closer together, you gave less time for the previous layer to cool before the next one is laid down. you can try increasing the fan speed to get better results, but this can lead to lifting and warping when printing with abs. 

if you are in a production type environment, it can be very beneficial to maximize this time and find the perfect balance. (we do this in our cluster) if you are not going to be printing this over and over again, it may be best just to leave them a little further apart. gl!


thanks kcchen and brent. i'm not in a production environment!, just a home workshop. i was printing some carraige stops of my own design for my lathe. i needed two sets of two parts...then the next night i decided why not make some extras since it's so easy, and got the drooping...then yesterday i made another two more sets with the spacing further apart to see if it would help. it did help.

so i originally needed two sets, and now i have 6. i may keep the drooped ones for my own use and put the straight ones on ebay.

thanks again,

taz dual v3 failures,"ok

what are people having success with for the tool change retraction amount?  i assume my issue might stem from that, but also maybe heat creep?

i am getting pretty consistent failures on dual extrusion prints.  after about 4-5 layers into a job, the filament stops extruding, roughly around the same time and typically on both nozzles.  after examining things, it appears there is a very slight (i mean really small) amount of grinding that occurred.  it seems that the filament might be getting jammed somewhere along the path to the nozzle.  i have tried tool change retraction in simplify3d @ 13mm.  it seems that cura 2.6 has somewhere around 5mm out of box.

i am running another print right now from s3d with 6mm tool change retraction. we'll see how it goes.  the frustration is starting to grow.  i just returned the turd that is the v2 dualmetal and was hoping to have better results with the v3.","what type of filament?

i'm at .7 - .9mm of retraction for abs... but that doesn't sound like the fix to your problem.

try increasing the extrusion temp by 2-5c... stay within the range recommended by the filament manufacturer.

also give the idler/tension screws a turn or two.  lulzbot supplied the jig for spacing the screw, but can't remember if they specified the use with filament unloaded or loaded...

increasing the extrusion temps will ensure the plastic can keep up with the print.  increasing the clamp on the filament should ensure its being fed... if you retract the filament, it should be rough from the hobbed gear.


if you're using abs in both extruders, i can upload my s3d profile for you to try."
total noob with soooo many questions...,"hi all,

i am completely new to 3d printing (yes, collective sigh) and this is my first week with my taz 6 and dual head v3.  i sort of assumed that there would be documentation on how to calibrate and troubleshoot...as in ""here is a picture of something goofy, and here are some steps you can take to try to fix it, and by the way, this is what it is called so if you have questions you can ask them without sounding like a total noob"".  does something like this exist and i am totally missing it?

regardless, i am obviously having several issues, and fingers crossed that they are related.

the first is that with the polydissolve s1, it seems to ooze out of the head.  in the pic the temp is 190.  the other head with polylite pla does not really have this problem...so i am guessing it is the filament.

the second is with my test cube (die).  i was curious to see what changing the default high detail layer thickness did (from 0.16 to 0.10).  yes, i know, i jumped right in...  the bottom 90% or so was typical of what i have been getting so far with the preset high detail settings, or even the preset standard settings.  but, as you can see the top 10% or so seems pretty nice to me.  so, what happened (or didn't happen) and what can i do to get a more predictable/consistent result like the top?  actually, the top did seem to warp or bend every so little to one side...which i am guessing means since that looks better than i have some sort of alignment or offset or something i need to look at and change since the rest didn't bend and looks...meh.

thanks in advance.  really, anything will help at this point.","the thermistors are set at different depths in the hot ends. check to see if the set screw for e2's thermistor is missing, i had that experience and it was a contributing factor to temp instability. also look at the v3 service bulletin. for the rest of it, google, trial and error. welcome to the biggest time suck you've ever experienced."

i've been using a taz 6 for over a year and only recently have been having issues. my first layer seems to go on sloppy; dragging filament and lifting. this happens with any size and complexity print. 

i use village plastics abs and default settings, which used to work for all kinds of prints. the unit has never been moved and is away from drafts or open windows.
to troubleshoot or to improve my prints, i've tried
verifing my print bed is at 110 and the hot end is 240 with an ir thermometer.
lowering my hot end temp to prevent overextrusion
cleaning the hot end and applying painter's tape for better adhesion
 same results.
thoughts? thanks","first guess is that your first layer is a bit far from the bed -- although i would have expected painter's tape to help if that were the case.

still, assuming that's the problem...  you may be able to compensate by increasing flow on first layer.  but probably better to adjust z-offset using the m851 command.  run m851, see what it reports, make it 0.05 lower.  (example:  if m851 reports z-1.25, try sending ""m851 z-1.30"" to get 0.05 closer to the bed.)   try another print, and repeat if needed.  

if that solves the adhesion problem, make sure to send an m500 command so the new offset is saved to memory (otherwise it will be lost at next power cycle or connect).

you can also resurface the pei for better adhesion.  with printer off and bed cool, use 1500 or 2000 grit sandpaper with a few drops of water or 50/50 isopropyl/water mix to ""wet sand"" the bed very lightly.  then clean again with a cotton cloth and some isopropyl alcohol.  you're looking to restore the ""matte"" finish of new pei, not trying to remove a lot of material."
thermal error with blank heater_id,"hello.

i'm not very experienced with the taz 6 or 3d printing in general, but i support three of these things and  manage them with octoprint. after three months of trouble-free printing, one of the taz 6's has begun to throw thermal errors, but the error does not indicate the problem's source. see below for a log snippet. 

besides testing the bed's and toolhead's thermistors and checking to make sure all connections are secure, what else can i do to diagnose the problem? these printers are pretty much in constant use, as we offer free printing of models for students, and i'd like at least to attempt some troubleshooting before giving up, requesting an rma, and then being down one printer for a few weeks.

thanks for whatever suggestions anyone may have to offer.

the bed not reaching/holding temp could be a bad bed thermistor (i.e., bed really is hot, but temp is reading low).  it could be a bad bed heater (but those are pretty reliable).  it could be bad wiring or plugs.  it may also be a broken wire in the bed cable chain -- particularly if you see the drop when the bed is moved to certain positions."
taz 5 and 1.75mm filament,"note: i am pretty sure the following is not going to be supported by lulzbot.

i recently received my new taz 5 and have been very pleased with it, but like others i have a buttload of 1.75mm pla filament from my previous printer.  i figured that the new hexagon hotend on the taz 5 was all metal and did not have the ptfe tube what would be the problem with just sending some 1.75 filament through it.  i figured that the main issue would be with retraction, but i am happy to say it worked perfectly.

i took my standard pla profile and just changed the filament diameter from 2.89 to 1.75, then print a calibration cube.  when loading the filament i did not adjust the extruder tension at all. it was dead perfect, wall thickness was dead on, dimensions were dead on, no blobbing, no holes.

since i tried this i have run full print plates with 1.75mm pla through the taz 5 with zero issues.  so for all those out there that have some 1.75mm pla sitting around, don't be scared to run it through.

i have not tried this with abs or any other material as i primarily had pla.

steven","defuzz wrote:i just finished a 12 hour print on my mini with red hatchbox 1.75mm pla at standard temps. loosening the idler screws did the trick for me. 

i initially thought it should be tightened... but that caused a ton of kinking. i found another thread where they've posted a stl with a jig for properly tensioning (it definitely seems to be for 3mm though... much tighter than what i had it set to for my successful print).

i still do get some accumulation on the hobbed bolt, but it never stopped extruding or got thin.

this is my current issue actually! i'm also using hatchbox 1.75mm on taz4 stock config. i also was tightening the screws thinking this would be better?! i tried a few times with the screws less loose, but still fairly tight - and no luck. 

for the accumulation: is it possible that your extruder is too close to the bed?

my issue is with the algorithm that the taz employs where it backs out the filament so as to stop the flow to the bed. as it's backing out the filament (and then driving it down again) it sometimes will snag on the cooling chamber entry (which is above the heatsink, and is in turn way above the extruder nozzle). the bind happens because the filament is already sort of loosened up and the filament actually doubles over on itself and binds completely in the large opening. it's really aggravating, i have had to clear it like 5-10 times already. 

things that i have had to do to make this configuration work are: change the filament size parameter,and slow the print speed way down (like 10-15mm/s). but on this particular model there are several places where the support material has to be 'dabbed' onto the print bed and this always causes the issue as it is backing the filament in and out of the chamber.

i also have turned the temp down to 180c. i started with it at 190-195c, but i felt the filament when i had to clear the chamber a few times and it was softer overall (higher up) at the higher temperatures. i can successfully print really really small pieces (like say 1hr print with slow speed - maybe 10cm part). 

i also halved the retraction speed, and i did the same for the distance after experimentation. at this point i wish there was an easy way to run the base layer in reverse. i know this action wouldn't help, by the way.

i'll keep hacking at it, as i have about 8 rolls of 1.75mm hatchbox to go through still...

i think it might be the distance to the printbed causing some extra pressure up the tube? next, i'm going to try backing it off some more and maybe increase the temp again. i need 'good enough' tack perhaps for this piece?

update:
the answer is 'no' to the above questions. i talked to some 3d printing experts in the industry. the concensus i arrived at was that you'll likely never print any large parts with this configuration. this is partially due to the way the industry is divided into 2 types of printers: 3mm and 1.75mm... and partially because lulzbot just wasn't designed or optimized around this filament size. this same expert group has lots of 1.75mm printers, and so... i made a deal to trade my 1.75mm for an equivalent amount of 3mm pla from them... which means my life will be a lot easier."
"""probing failed"" message on taz 6","on my last print (my second or third using octopi finally) the extruder started dragging roughly across the print about 2/3rds of the way in.  not just a little and it was mashing the plastic into a flat layer up top.  so i quit the print.  today i tried another print of the brackets for the enclosure i just got in the mail from printed solid and it's now giving me a ""probing failed"" message in the beginning and i see the probe trying to ""wipe"" and it's much too high to be touching the pad.

dual v3 with flexible filaments (ie. ninjaflex),"hi, i'm wanting to get into printing e-nable prosthetics, and of the requests i've seen on their site a bunch have flexible parts. so, i was reading about the new aerostruder handling standard and flexible filaments really well and was about to place an order for one when i noticed that the dual v3 also uses the e3d aeros. on the dual v3 product page it sounds like the lulzbot team has had success with some flexible filaments but it's not an out-of-the-box feature and may take some profile tweaking to get it working (if at all). has anyone had any success with some of the softer filaments like ninjaflex using the dual v3?

if you have a dual v3, i actually have a couple sample spools of ninjaflex sitting on my desk right now so would be open to mailing one of them out to someone willing to do some tests and report back. i'd honestly rather eat the cost of one of these sample spools then drop the $560 on a dual v3 then find out it doesn't work out.","i ran a 600g print with 85 shore a tpu. no problem there. ive done pla/pva as well. biggest issue was adjusting the z rods to get them even. i ran a terminal g28; g29; g1 x140 y140; g1 z0; then put a feeler guage underneath each nozzle to make sure they were even, and set z offset. watch specific fw version, when the bed levels itself off different nozzles, you fight yourself and i could never get it quite perfect. 

i can vouch for the feed first then remove method. also making a fishhook almost loading filament seems to help. i still don't see why it wasn't a straight down load.

what has been giving me trouble in here is petg. it seems the second nozzle keeps scraping it back off the bed.

as for the aerostruder, right now i just have the itworks version. i needed the ss hob, titanium heat break and a2 nozzle (mainly got it for cf filaments). it has not been able to run any softer flexible materials at all. it clogs alot and has needed to be torn down twice now. not impressed with it tbh."
lulzbot taz dual extruder v3 tool head,"lulzbot taz dual extruder v3 tool head

i bought the lulzbot taz dual extruder v3 tool head and had to return it twice because it kept clogging. i was never able to get a complete print finished. lulzbot is sending me a brand new one and i would like to know if anyone is having repeated success with this nozzle and if so, what are the best practices?

lulzbot support has recommended the following. what does everyone think of this?

""in the future to prevent this we advise you remove filament after use if possible. when not possible, heat extruder to 210 and then extrude 50mm filament, then remove filament to swap filament. 

also do periodic ""cold pulls"" nylon works best at 220 and then 120 for the pull, but you can also use the pla at 220 and then 120. this will help with future stripping issues.""

thanks,

fitz","when switching out filaments on the v3 dual extrusion head i found it easiest to heat up the head to near the current filament’s printing temperature, extrude 10mm, unscrew the screw all the way and remove it, and then pull out the filament (or you could click the “cold pull” button, that will set your extruded temp to 160 degrees and then pull out the filament). note: extruding before pulling is the key here.  you could heat up to the printing temperature or higher and it still will not come out and you’ll snap your filament and possibly be in a world of trouble.

when the old filament is out i insert the new filament (screw still out, i find it much easier to load too with the screw out), push in the new filament as far as it will go, re-insert screw and tighten until you see the filament move from the top of the filament insertion hole to the center or bottom should be tight enough.  set the extruder’s temperature to the new filament’s printing temperature and then begin extruding until i see the new filament coming out."

put a nick in the bed material,"hello,

first time poster and brand new user of the taz6 or any 3d printer. i received this incredible machine as a retirement gift from the company i worked for. 

last night while trying to remove an object from the bed i put a nick in the bed's surface material.   

can this material be replaced or if not, what am i looking at in order to replace the bed? 

please be gentle.

pops","a small nick or mark is usually not a problem -- you can usually print right over it without any noticeable flaws on the bottom of the part you've printed.  from experience   , even a large gash can be tolerated (whilst one is waiting for a new pei sheet to arrive) -- as long as you can shift the part around in cura so that it avoids the defect.  i've done this process a few times now, the sheet is considered a ""consumable"" and i've learned it's wise to have one on-hand at all times...

here's a link to a replacement pei sheet in the lulzbot store: 

https://www.lulzbot.com/store/parts/lul ... -pei-sheet

and here's the procedure for replacing the pei sheet on the lulzbot mini.  not sure there's an equivalent for the taz, but it's the same with the possible exception of the process for unplugging the connectors for the heater.
  also, if you taz is really, really new, i think it's possible that it has the new modular bed -- in which case, the heater and the aluminum plate to which it's attached stays, and all you have to do is lift the glass off once you've removed the four bed screws.

poor man's pause on filament run out,"this works as long as you're printing via usb and you don't plan on using the computer for other things while you're printing. 

obtain a cheap usb mouse. open it up and connect wires parallel across the left button switch's normally open pins. run these wires to a filament run out switch configured to close when filament runs out or jams. plug the cheap mouse into the computer running cura. when you start the print, leave the mouse point on the ""print"" button, which turns into the ""pause"" button in older versions of cura's control window. in newer versions, move the pointer to hover over the separate pause button. that's it! if filament runs out or jams, the kludged mouse clicks pause for you.","yes, this is anything but elegant! it should be noted that the detecting switch in this ""poor man's"" kluge needs to make a momentary contact, then releases, otherwise it does a click and hold, that is, the mouse would send the button down signal but no button up signal via usb. it's not a great idea to begin with, requiring that you don't move the mouse pointer off the pause button on the screen for the duration of the print, but i can build a usb mouse (i design and make special purpose usb mice) that will automatically generate both the button down and up signals by detecting just a switch closure."

enclosure design sanity check...,"greetings. great forum you all have here, one of the prime reasons, after a year or so or research, i'm about to pull the trigger on a taz.

http://a360.co/2e0pd1g  this is a link to a fusion 360 file for an enclosure/storage cabinet i am in the process of designing.  i would really appreciate any comments re size/clearance and any other considerations i should be aware of prior to construction.

the design is unfinished.  it will have two doors in the front.  the entire top half will lift off the base cabinet if needed.  the fan in the top will be controlled by a thermostat, temperature determined by filament being used.  also, it will live in my garage with a lot of dust producing woodworking machines, one of my other hobbies.

this will be my first 3d printer so my knowledge level is pretty much zero.  also, i've bootstrapped myself through fusion 360 this past year for my cnc router needs.  so, i know just enough about it to be dangerous.  sorry, atm i don't know how to export other file types from f360.

thanks!","that enclosure is awesome.  i would make sure to make the front or back easy to take off in the case you need to remove or work on the taz.  enclosures are great until you need to fix/troubleshoot something. 

as svanwhy mentioned the electronics won't do well in enclosures.   i would find a way to get air from outside the cabinet going through the chamber with your electronics.  here was my first step towards keeping the electronics cooled: viewtopic.php?f=7&t=5901&p=34687#p34687

recently i've had an issue with my prints shifting which i've read could be a symptom of the rambo's driver ics overheating. so this weekend i am upgrading the 80mm fan in the cabinet to move substantially more air over the electronics.  to protect my prints from being affected by the higher level of air movement, i am creating a duct for the exhaust to get it outside of the cabinet.

once i have everything nailed down, i'll post my files to my thingiverse https://www.thingiverse.com/sneaks/designs

if you print in abs - check out a company called hoffman.  they make heaters designed for electronic enclosures that work great for printer enclosures.  new they are $500 - but if you watch ebay you can get one under $100."

when you replaced the rambo did it come with new fuses or did you reuse the fuses from your older rambo board? this sounds like a blown fuse to me. you could try swapping the f2 and f3 fuses on your board and see if the lcd screen comes on, if it does that will mean the fuse was the issue. if that is the issue you can buy a replacement here: https://www.lulzbot.com/store/parts/5-a ... olyfuse-x3


yes the new rambo comes with new fuses. anyway i got it solved now, what you have to do is install firmware into it. i got confuse because the symptom after replaced the lcd and rambo board is the same as the old broken board. also i expect some firmware to be pre-installed on the new board as i bought it from lulzbot. i thought the board is broken and nearly buy another one."
"random temperature drop, firmware disconnection on taz 5 dual v2?","alas, another 2 issues with this taz 5 dual v2 i've been working with. it seems determined to put me in an early grave.

issue one:
there has been this issue with the taz randomly disconnecting itself. i have reinstalled the firmware and checked its accuracy more times than i can count, to no avail. it randomly does this all the time, at least once a week.

is it more likely an issue with the board, the drivers, or the computer/usb?

see the image where it says ""firmware unresponsive"" in the communication log, then where i issued an emergency stop...


issue two:
so it appears that t0 can't hold its temperature. it will be set to 235 and print for about 30 minutes or so, then it drops to roughly 225, 226 and struggles to get back to 235. this happens a few times over the course of a print.

obviously its something wrong with the hot end... but which part? should i just replace the entire hot end? or is it something else?

keep in mind i'm using s3d here but the problem happens no matter what slicer is being used. 

could this connectivity failure have anything to do with the temperature drops as well?

thanks all!","if you have access to a digital multimeter, you can check the resistance measurements on the tool head to see if the thermistor or heater cartridge is bad. with the printer turned off and unplugged, disconnect the hot end from the wiring harness and test hot end for the proper resistance. the smaller wires coming from the hot end are for the thermistor and should read ~100k ohms at room temperature. the larger wires are connected to the heater cartridge and should read ~20 ohms. that should help you narrow down if this is an issue with the hotend itself or an issue somewhere else. if those measurements come back okay it could be a break in your wiring. to test that you can take those same resistance measurements but where the wiring plugs into the control board to see if you are getting the same readings. it helps to move the wire around when you are doing this in case the break is intermittent."

backlash in y axis - taz 5,"i am getting gaps in solid layers on my taz 5. when the y axis changes directions, it extrudes the new line too close to the previous one. i get a pattern like this || || || where the solid fill is made of groups of two extrusions separated by a gap.

the .8mm would only print faster if you set the layer height to .5 (60% of the nozzle opening).  the print duration would probably the same if you printed at a layer height of .2 or .3.  reducing infill could help print duration, but the outer perimeter print speed would have the biggest effect on speed."
why does filament extrude before printing.,"after the probing and homing phase, my taz6 extrudes a small amount of filament as its moving into position to begin the print. unless i ""catch"" it with some kind of tool, it messes up the print. does anyone know why it would do this?

extruder too low?,"can the height of the extruder be easily changed? with any of the prints i try, it seems like the extruder is to low to the build plate which causes the filament to build up and eventually stick to the hotend. i'm not sure if this is the main issue for the printing problems i've been having, but is there an easy way to to raise the extruder height?

edit: printer i'm using is taz 6.","if you get the z-offset looking good (per instructions linked in post above), and still have the same issue, the next to things are:
1 - measure filament diameter with calipers, and enter the value into slicer;
2 - calibrate e-steps.  here's a guide for that: https://ohai.lulzbot.com/project/extrud ... libration/

after all 3 of those...  if you still have the issue, reduce the extrusion multiplier by 5% (0.95, or 95%) and see if that helps."
taz 5 x axis just vibrates back and forth a few mm’s,"first time ever having any issues. just finished a print with no trouble and went to print again a few hours later and my taz 5 won’t move on the x axis. just vibrates. i tried moving it manually and it barely moves with force. any suggestions?

taz 5 e3dv6 pt100 thermocouple,"anyone here tried to install a thermocouple on their rambo boards? i'm trying to print some higher temp material and purchased the pt100 upgrade kit. any input would be appreciated! thanks!

here's the upgrade: http://e3d-online.com/v6-pt100-sensor-kit?search=pt100","hello nick,

yes i am using the pt100 kit from e3d, plus their titan and hardened nozzles on my taz5.

here are the pins that you need to connect to your pt100 (use the e3d pt100 and use the e3d paired sensor kit):

on the pt100's three pins you need to connect 
pin 1 (5v analog ext)
pin 2 (gnd analog ext2)
and pin 4 (ext 6 analog ext pin #93)

the pt100 amplifier board has the legend for which pin is 5v, gnd and signal printed on it, so just follow that.

rambo analog extension pins below where x has a connector, 0 is open (if you are looking directly at the rambo board): 

                 x 0 x 0
                 x 0 0 0

the two pins on the other end of the pt100 connects to the paired sensor.you'll need to disconnect the hexagon's old sensor connector and reconnect to the two pins of the pt100 (orientation is irrelevant here).

change your pins.h and recompile in marlin. check your config.h as well - it must have the pt100 definition in there to work. you may have to use newer tables from marlin which has the pt100 (but don't use the newest marlin set since it is sure to fail on compile - just add the sensor table alone).

this setup worked for me. i hope this helps you.

flexydually test print very stringy,"i've just bought a flexydually v2, run through the calibration process and tried to do the standard test print (the keyring).

the results came out like this:



this is using the filament that came with the flexydually and the abs & ninjaflex profile that came with cura. 

any suggestions about what i should look at to try to fix this?","hey 

    this is my first post, actually i was looking for a solution to something else when i came across this one, so, pretty much, i went ahead and registered just to answer your question. your welcome. just joking with you.    anyway, it seems like 2 things
1. you heat bed may need to increase i do mine at 110
2. your filament temperature may also need to increase as well, i do mine at 235
3. when you print, make sure your advanced setting is on with the ooze shield and filament tower on

i think that should do it"
taz 5 and 6 proper layer heights?,"what is the step height for the taz 5 and 6? 

you may think that a lower layer height is always better. 0.05 must be better than 0.08, right? the problem with this is that stepper motors move in steps. these motors moving in parts of a step can be a big problem over time. less accurate layers will result in big layer lines and weaker layers.

what is their stepper motors is geared to?

what is the smallest layer possible?

cheers


jh","to avoid z wobble, i've found that layer heights divisible by 5 are orefferable, unless you have an antiwobble fitted, in which case you can ignore that and use whatever you want. i can print a 0.01mm layer with a 0.1mm nozzle on my slightly modified machine. the general rule is you want about 3/4ths your nozzle size as a theoretical maximum layer height, and your theoretical minimum height is as small as you can make it without your filament grinding out or your patience running out. the moons motors used in the 6 are very effective at holding position even in microstepping mode. with newer stepper controllers (or even adding a servo position sensor to those motors) additional precision is also possible. the frame of the taz becomes  the limiting factor for further resolution before stepper motor resolution does. plus the whole pressure advance k factor linear acceleration mess that gives you the persistent corner issues and varies with material type."
printer software for the taz 3?,"hello, i just dusted off my taz 3, it has not seen much action and i wanted to get it up and running again. its been standing for 2 years more or less now.

i am running macosx high sierra on the machine the taz3 is connected to, it used to work with cura ""14-ish"" but the new cura lulzbot edition does not seem to recognize/support taz 3.

would anyone happen to know the highest version of cura i can use with my printer (or whether i can setup a taz 3 with cura lulzbot editon) ?","the control board inside a 3 is the same control board inside a 5 or a 6, so it will certanly connect. you are going to not want to update your firmware though, because the 4, 5, and 6 firmware uses a different leadscrew z steps value. as long as you connect and tell it to just use the existing firmware, you should be fine. you'll have to adjust your print profiles to get the temperatures right for the older style nozzle, but it should otherwise work. 

i would reccommend you look into sourcing a set of the taz 4-6 style leadscrews and upgrade your printer to at least a taz 5 spec. the new hotend and z axis setup really improves quality oveer what the 3 is capable of. the endplates will run you $40 https://itworks3d.com/product/lulzbot-t ... -endplate/ finding the leadscrews and leadscrew nuts is a bit tricky, but the ones for the 6 work just fine there too. you also need the two couplers, 4 608zz bearings, and the parts for the z endstop height adjustor(m5 heat set insert, bolt, spring, thumbscrew end), the x axis limit switch extension wire, or the auto leveling parts for the 6 (expect to spend $150 there)"
taz 4 hot end wood material,what type of wood is used in the taz 4 extruder assembly that can withstand those temperatures?  mine cracked when the hot end got clogged and it tried to force the material through.  it's the piece of wood just above the hot end that the screws go through to secure the assembly together and it has 3 cutouts for routing the wires from the hot end. i'm trying to repair but not sure what type of wood would be appropriate for this application.,"looks like itworks still has some.

1.75 mm filament in 3.0 mm hot end,"hello guys, 

i want to ask if it is ok to use 1.75 mm filament in a hot end that is suitable for 3.0 mm filament. the hot end specifications says it is recommended to use 3.0 mm but what i have and what i do experiment on is 1.75 mm filaments. 

does anyone have tried to print different filament sizes ? 

thanks. 
omk216","which version of the taz do you have?  

for the most part it seems like folks have had good success getting through surplus 1.75mm filament on the hexagon hotends (taz 5/6) when moving from other machines.  

if you're buying new filament, get the right sized 3.0mm filament.

if you want use 1.75mm all the time, best to convert the hotend.

do a search for ""1.75mm"" on the forums... there was a lot of traffic a year or two ago about capabilities and compatibilities.  hopefully someone on the forum can chime in with their experiences."
what material is nozzle tip made from?,"hello,

i have a lulzbot taz 6, and i am wondering what material the nozzle tip is made from.  i hear many people refer to it as a brass nozzle tip.  but i am wondering if it is indeed brass or if it is copper?  i have attached two different pdf's that indicate the material could be made of either brass or copper.  the 'nozzle_3mm-0.5mm_v0.2' file is from the devel.lulzbot page, and this indicates that the nozzle is made of copper.  the other file shows that some nozzles can be made of copper while others could be made from brass.

i'm curious because the thermal conductivity is quite different between copper and brass.

i appreciate the feedback.","i found out from alephobjects that the nozzles are made of brass, but they have a beryllium copper finish.  the copper finish provides higher conductivity for the auto leveling task, but the body of the nozzle is all brass."
prints not sticking on bed centre,"hey all

for a few days now my taz 6 is giving me a hard time. anything i print in the centre of the bed it will not stick. anything above, below, left or right is fine. which is annoying if something is spread across the whole bed.

i've taken the bed glass off and it is flat, even adjusted z offset to see if that helps and no luck there.

physical security question,"i am a professor at a small, liberal arts university.  we just got our lulzbot taz 6.  we are keeping the printer in a small computer lab that has keycard access and is restricted to our physics, engineering, computer science, and math majors.  i am not afraid of someone walking away with the machine.  i am concerned about:
someone printing something inappropriate over the weekend
someone who doesn't know how to use the printer trying to print something and causing a problem

i'm trying to figure out the best way to limit people's ability to use the machine.  putting it in another room is not an option.  removing the power cord or usb cable or something like that doesn't seem like it would work; those are standard parts and there are spares around the room.

does anybody have thoughts?","there isn't an easy way. you could build a locking enclosure cabinet which will also improve abs printing and control access to the keys (remember to properly vent the control box so you don't melt it) . alternatively you could open the case and wire in an electrical interlock key that would prevent operation without the key. that would void your warranty. 

you could also just install a security camera like an arlo cam set to mail you video snapshots of anyone entering the room on the weekend."

upgrade to newest lulzbot firmware for taz6. it has a hot swap filament change built into the firmware that is much better then older firmware. you still have to monitor print, for a run out.

harder, but still easier the hard wiring a filament sensor and changing firmware to support it.
buy a cheapo endstop, put it in a 3d printed housing, and connect that to octoprint instead of having to hard wire something directly into taz6's motherboard.

taz 5 heating bed - temperature error,"hello, 
i recently noticed a temperature error of the heating bed of my taz5, which prevents me from printing correctly. i usually print pla, where i set the temperature of the heating bed to 60°c - the lcd screen shows that the heating bed is heating up, and once it stops (when the lcd screen shows 60°c on the bottom), the heating bed does not actually have the 60°c. it only has heated to about 35°c - i measure it with a pyrometer. (

my conclusion was that the temperature sensor of the heating bed does not measure correctly (anymore), so i bought a new heating bed, plugged it in, set the temperature to 60°c and i still have the same problem! the screen says that it has heated up to 60°c, but the heating bed is way to cold to print on. thats 80$ wasted.

i can now only conclude that something on the printer motherboard has stopped working, but before i replace that, i wondered if maybe someone knows a solution for my problem. thanks","the thermistor the heated bed uses is the same kind the hotend uses. if you have a spare hotend thermistor you could attach it to the bed temporarily, run wires into the control box and see if  that one is reporting correctly. it would be a $3.00 test rather than another $80 one. the thermistor readings are resistance based. it is possible that the taz 5 bed connector at the back of the control box has been damaged (its not rated for the full 15 amps the fuse can draw, so it sometimes uh, melts a bit. normally that would affect the heating element feed, not the thermristor reporting, but if it melted in the right place maybe the thermristor wire has a very bad connection now? it could also be a mostly broken wire in the harness run. i'm thinking like a single copper strand of the cable still intact, which would still run current but at high enough resistance the thermristor is reading it wrong? 

if its the board itself, they are expensive so you don't want it to be the board. i've seen more of the panel mount connectors fail than boards on the heated bed side, so thats where i would check next. bypassing that connector and the wire run with a new wire harness to a hotend thermristor would also clear the board of any possible damage (or confirm it)"
review of lulzbot modular print bed heater,"so i broke my original taz 4 glass bed back before christmas.  i ordered a bunch of replacement parts, modular bed (heater and glass), new silicone heater, and new borosilicate glass.  along with working on a plan b of an aluminum plate. 

this is my review of the new modular bed for my taz.   

weight
let's talk about weights first cause i know some of you guys are worried about that. 
heater with stainless steel heat spreader 1lb 9.4 oz 
modular glass pei - 1lb 8.4oz  
total 3lb 1.8oz 

original borosilicate glass 1lb 7.2oz  (minus pet tape) 
silicone heater  6.8oz 
total 1lb 14oz 

1/8thk aluminum plate 1lb 4.6 oz 
total 1lb 12oz

so you are gaining about a full pound of weight on the y-axis.  i haven't seen any negative effects, but i run my machine at conservative speeds.  i'm sure this extra weight will cause some of you guys issues at higher speeds. 

heat mat
one thing that lulzbot didn't mention is they have changed the heat mat for this modular bed system, or have at least used a different heat mat from the original one that came with my taz 4.  on this new heat mat, the resistive elements are thinner but are more evenly spaced across the bed, as shown in the pictures below.



 new heat mat

 old heat mat

temperature accuracy
with the printer up to operating temp and allowing enough time for the temperature to stabilize i am seeing about 25c difference between what the printer is indicating and what i am measuring on the glass surface. 

i haven't had time to take a comparative measurement of an original glass bed.  if someone has these values please let me know.   

temperature distribution
i am seeing about a 2c across the bed with the colder areas being in the middle of the bed (measured after 5hr print job).   this is caused by the sagging of the 22 gauge (0.0310""thk ) stainless sheet not contacting the glass in the center of the bed.  i understand this is a compromise, a thicker sheet would not sag, but would increase the weight of the assembly.   i am going to apply some small springs to help hold up the stainless plate and hopefully even out the temperature across the glass. 

pet to pei
i've been running this printer continuous for 3 days now and not having to prep the bed with abs/acetone slurry has been amazing.  i have been running batches of small parts and they have been adhering well, i have yet to try a large abs part.   i worry that a large part may warp more on pei than pet due to low holding force that pei has (with pet i could load the bed down with abs glue to ensure a solid bond).","i'm noticed the same temperature difference with my modular bed also. abs sticks at 110c, so i didn't think much about it.  wrote it off as the infrared not working properly with the translucent pei & glass.  maybe putting a sheet of paper the pei then taking the temp might produce more accurate results.  one of these days i'll check with the thermal camera... 

to help with the sagging plate, i used binder clips on each side.  it holds the glass to the plate... at least on the edges.  may i ask the approximate gap on the leading edge of the bed?  this apparently is by design, and the gap diminishes when heated... i haven't removed the binder clips to verify."
moarstruder issue,"changed my stock .5mm hexagon with the moarstruder. flashed the firmware and used the standard pla profile off the site. cura says the cooling should have started at 3mm. the cooling fans did not turn on at all. they are screaming hot and not turning. the nozzle cooling fan is turning. pretty sure i have the correct tool connector with 2 pins coming out of the board and inserting to the moar connector correctly.
i did need to turn the cable pin connector 180 degrees for the pins to align to plug in. i assume this is a wiring issue somewhere. unless i missed something i'm pretty sure i have the right v2c tool head harness.","turn the printer off, then back on
try turning the filament cooling fans on manually from the lcd:
- temperature
- fan speed
- adjust to 128, then push the button to set. the value range is 0-256, so 128 = 50%
if the fans don't come on:
- turn the printer off
- remove the toolhead
- remove the two screws that secure each of the filament cooling fans
- look at the hub of the fan. are they 5v or 24v? they should be 24v.
- if they are 24v, + and - are likely connected backward."
rasberry pi and webcam for the taz,"i'm looking to wirelessly connect to my taz's and watch / record them while they're printing.

1. which rasberry pi kit do people buy and how do they mount it to the taz 5 and taz 6?

2. which webcam do people buy and how do they mount it to the taz 5 and taz 6?","the raspberry pi 3 model b is the current version and has built-in wi-fi. they run for about $35. you can print out a case that mounts to the side of the taz 6 control box:

i run octopi as my print server on a pi3 for my taz 6 and it has worked very well. i bought a logitech c270 usb webcam online, which has worked great with octopi after some simple and well documented configuration. the nice thing about the c270 is that it can be taken apart and the focus could be manually adjusted. auto focus cameras on a printer with a moving bed, like the taz, causes constant out of focus issues. this way, you can position it closer to the bed without blurring up the image. i used this camera mount as it follows the head in the z-axis:

help: taz 6 thumb screws,"hello folks

i recently moved about 500 miles and brought my taz 6 with me in my tiny car, and during the move i managed to misplace the thumbscrews that connect the x (or y, not sure on the exact nomeclature) axis assembly to the rest of the printer.  i can't seem to find any information on these four screws online, but i'm sure they're probably off-the-shelf parts, and i can order replacements fairly easily if i just knew the dimensions or the part numbers.  does anyone know where i could find replacements for these screws?  if not, perhaps someone with a taz 6 could take some measurements of the screws used and i could go find a suitable replacement part.  it seems so silly to have 99% of a printer sitting here useless because i'm missing 4 screws.  thanks",those are m5 bolts with thumbscrew caps. either 10 or 12mm i think. you may be able to find them locally at home repair stores like home depot or lowes. mcmaster carr has them online https://www.mcmaster.com/#thumb-screws/=1az3rim i usually get the press fit tops and make them myself.
v3 dual extruder on taz 4,"hello everyone,

while we haven't specifically included firmware or install directions for the v3 dual extruder on the taz 4 some of our more advanced users may want to try their hand at making it work! below you can find a brief overview of how to get this up and running for people who want to give it a shot. 

as this tool head is all set up for a taz 5, the easiest path for using it on your printer is to upgrade your taz 4 to a taz 5. the only major difference between the two versions is: the 5 came with an all metal hot end, pei on the bed, internal wire harnesses to support the extra cooling fans for the all metal hot end, and a different connector for hot ends for ease of use.

first things first, you will need to install two internal wiring harness for your controller box. they can be purchased here: https://www.lulzbot.com/store/parts/int ... arness-add (if you have already installed a hexagon hot end upgrade, you will only need one additional harness.)

wiring harness for extruder port 1 directions can be found on step 9 here: https://ohai.lulzbot.com/project/taz4-h ... cessories/

wiring harness for extruder port 2 directions can be found here: https://ohai.lulzbot.com/workflow/prep- ... cessories/

next install the updated tool head harness to match the v3 connector pins. this is a simple screw in to the controller box, and will allow connection to the extra fans on the tool head. this can be purchased here: https://www.lulzbot.com/store/parts/lul ... ad-harness

those are the only hardware modifications required! for getting everything else set up, follow through with the taz 5 and taz 6 install directions in the ohai kit here: https://ohai.lulzbot.com/project/lulzbo ... cessories/

when flashing the firmware, be sure to use the taz 5 firmware. with the hardware changes, you're now rocking a taz 5!

as a note, when setting up cura you can re-name your machine to a taz 4 v3 dual extruder to prevent confusion. 

we hope this helps!","djohnson wrote: ?sat dec 30, 2017 7:36 pm
hi,
upgrading a taz 4 with a flexydually v2
the hardware part is easy but, i have customized my firmware to include auto bed leveling for the taz 4 (using a servo z probe, etc..)

is there any place that documents the changes i will need to make to the arcuino / marlin codebase to support the new hexagon hotends? (i cannot use your *baked* firmwares due to my bed leveling customization)

is there a git repo for the taz 5 firmware that i can refer to for these settings?

i am thinking it will just be a matter of setting min/max temps on the extruders and some changes related to fan pins?

any direction you have is greatly appreciated.
thank you,


as long as you use the new marlin 1.1.5.* fw that is in the ""devel"" branch of lulzbot marlin, it should be fairly easy. simply compile taz 5 fw for the toolhead and it should work on a taz 4.

with the new marlin ""devel"" branch, you modify the file ""marlin/configuration_lulzbot.h"" to set what printer and toolhead you want to compile for. the actual differences are worked out by the ""marlin/conditionals_lulzbot.h"" file. if you need to make small adjustments for your own use, you can still modify ""configuration.h"" and ""configuration_adv.h"" as before.

taz pei surface & extude problems,"hi,

i have two questions about taz6.

1. the back of the pei surface start to lift up when the bed heat up to 100degree or more, what can i  make it back to normal? (as below image)






2.the nozzle often stop extrude  when printing. when i take the filament off, i found that the end of the filament was fatter than normal. i had tried several of filament and filament brands, still have the same problem.i tried to make the idler tighter, it is better, but still have the same problem. what can i do for it?










thanks","how long have you had the printer?  the pei issue might be under warranty.  i've only seen pei relax to a flat state when left removed from the bed for a few days.  if its not covered under warranty, you'll probably need a new sheet... if you're careful and the adhesive is in good shape (flat), the new pei sheet can be stuck onto the existing adhesive without removal.  that can be debated, but removing the adhesive is difficult.

the swelling of filament is called heat creep.  its fairly normal.  make sure the heatsink fan is working and on whenever the machine is on.  it doesn't look so bad in your picture.    

to fix the extrusion stopping mid print, you can try a few things.  
1. tighten the idler by 1 or 2 turns so that the filament is gripped better by the hobbed bolt.  the idler spring should be compressed to about 8mm.  there's also a jig that can be printed to obtain the proper idler distance.  
2.  increase the extrusion temp by 1-5c.  this will help ensure the hotend keeps up with extrusion demand.  just remember to stay within the manufacturer temp recommendations.  

hope that helps."
how do i manually extrude?,"we just relieved a taz 6 at our school. a large abs print became dislodged and clogged and spattered the extruder. how do i manually extrude filament just to clean/ test it? this is our first lb and the rest of printers are maker bots. the lb is cool, but the cura software is not exactly intuitive:(","reach out to our support team! ordinarily they're in 24/7, but will be out this monday, january 1. reach us at lulzbot.com/support. include some pictures as well if you can. we'll have you printing soon, once we're able to see what you're looking at. ordinarily you can clean off your hot end when warm, but for safety's (and your hot end's)-sake, drop us a message first.

also, when at printing temperature, simply turn the large gear by hand to manually extrude filament. you can do this in the latest version of cura lulzbot edition as well, under ""new control panel"": https://www.lulzbot.com/learn/tutorials ... -whats-new"
titan aero on taz 6,"hey all

i've just finished building the itworks titan aero extruder and i am having stepper motor issues. i am using the motor that is supplied with the aero kit from e3d

i am using 3mm filament ( i know its not quite 3mm but hey...)

i can feed filament in ok and but when extruding there is stuttering, it starts to extrude ok then stutters. if i pull the idler arm away from the hob gear slightly it stops stuttering and extrudes fine. at this point i haven't even tightened the idler spring, doing so makes stuttering worse.

is this a classic example of backlash or is something else going on? 

gears are aligned, might be a small discrepancy of .2 of a mm as it looks flush.","does it stutter when you extrude in mid-air?  raise the nozzle 10-100mm above the surface and try extruding.  

i don't have much experience with the titan aero... but it could be that you're too close to the bed.  and there is too much pressure as the filament is fed.  check that your slicer is set to the right filament diameter... if you're printing 3mm filament and the slicer is set to 1.75, then the extruder is feeding twice as much filament then necessary."
left z axis threaded rod binding,"i started getting failed prints, first with the pla coming off the bed (glue stick fixed problem (so i thought)), then suddenly bubble affect on my print about 5mm high (abort print).  i checked the z axis stepper motor alignments according to step #23 of the service bulletin (https://www.lulzbot.com/sites/default/f ... lletin.pdf), though my printer did not fall within the serial number range of the bulletin, the taz 6 printer is about 2 weeks old s/n 25288.  sure enough there was a difference between left and right z axis.  brought back in alignment, next print and all prints afterwards kept failing, out right badly from the nozzle dragging over the dried and bubbled up pla to just plain ugly entirely.  re-align and right back to failure.  checked the entire framing as described in the service bulletin.  everything is flush and squared as it should be.  same distance from corner to corner in all directions.

lots of troubleshooting and searching and reading... long story short, what i found while checking the squaring of the frame is that the left threaded rod felt kind of binding as i would turn it to align it to a measurement.  the right rod would turn smoothly and freely.  i can't see any type of adjustment for this.  seems as though the rod is slightly bent or something with the mount that rides the threads.

attached is a picture as a result.  you can see by the slant that the motors aren't turning in synch, or in my case the left side is binding thus not moving up the appropriate amount, the same amount as the right side.

also, homing the axis, adjusting to both sides are even, then running it all the way up the z axis (270mm) works without a problem.  that test passes.  when i print, it fails.  i tried both high detail and standard.

please let me know if there's an adjustment i can do or if you need to ship me out another part or if i need to ship this back for warranty repair.  i have it apart right now for the squaring of the frame, no sense on putting it back until i can get that rod to spin and move freely.

thanks,

this first picture is an example of how bad it got, and this is at standard height.

the second picture demonstrates how the vertical axis is crawling to the left.","i did contact support, we went through some troubleshooting steps.  i swapped the left & right motors, seems the lag followed the motor and began leaning towards the right side slightly; however still at around 7mm in height the left side would bind up and start the failure of the print.  the x axis would no longer be level with the right side being up slightly higher than the left and i would then have difficulty getting them to move up the z axis to get the nozzle away from the print.  it seemed to be getting even worse and getting in a bigger jam when failing.  i did notice when i had the coupler's disconnected from the motor housing that the left screw was just as free to turn as the right side and with the coupler's screwed all the way to the top i could then slide the bar that holds the print head up and down freely (meaning without the jack screw).  i could feel some resistance on the lower end of the guide rods.  either one of the rods are not perfectly round or one of the bearings are faulty.  anyways, i shipped it back to them so they can see it and experience it too.  hopefully they'll give it a more thorough analysis.

taz5 z-axis skewed after each print,"hey guys,

i have been noticing some binding/grinding sounds lately as the x rail travels up/down along the z-axis. i’ve noticed that this is happening due to the x-axis rail not being level with the frame. after manually leveling the x rail - by measuring each side against the frame and manually rotating the left/right stepper motors - the binding/grinding stops.

after each print, or manually moving the z-axis, the x rail becomes skewed again. it’s more apparent over a longer set of traversing moves and in print quality. i’ve come to the conclusion that the issue lies within the z-axis motors. 

is there a way to calibrate/fix this motor issue, or do i need to just replace both motors?

thanks in advance!","thanks for that info. i’m away from my printer for the next week.5 so i’ll be sure to check on those when i return.

check your motor coupler for missing or loose setscrews or a broken motor coupler.  there are 4 setscrews per coupler, 2 on each end. one of the ones on each end should be on the flat spot. it is not uncommon for them to come loose or fall out. 

a broken coupler can still drive but will retract wrong. 

if it's not that, it could be binding due to the x carriage alignment, or a motor missing half it's coil power supply.

hotend really clogged,"hi,

i have an extremely bad pla clog in the heatsink of my taz 5's hexagon hotend (i assume due to heat creep?). in other cases i've been able to successfully clear rather nasty clogs by removing the nozzle and using a 2.5mm allen wrench to push the clog back up, with the hotend at printing temperature. however, in this case the clog seems to be completely stuck: i've applied quite a bit of force and it refuses to come out.

i've gone so far as to disassemble the hotend, to the point where i have the heatsink with the pipe that goes in it. using the allen wrench to measure depths, the clog seems to be about 11mm long, starting about 15mm from the top of the heatsink. this being pla, submerging it in acentone will not help at all.

any ideas how to clear this up? a dual extruder v3 is on its way to me but i was hoping to print a few things before christmas!

i also wonder how unclogging the dual v3 will work, since the filament path seems to be quite intricate, plus levelling the 2 nozzles after removing/replacing them could be a bit tricky.","seems really bad. have you tried to disassemble the hear break as well?
for dissolving the pla, acetone might not be best but weld-on no3 from scigrip, believe me, it softens it very well. the thing is that being cooked and stuck in there so bad who really knows what kind of chemical could have any effect on that.
you could use a culinary blow torch or a hair dryer in an attempt to soften it up with heat and then try again to push it out. just make sure you use pliers instead of bare hands to hold the hot heatsink!"
taz 6 - y axis bearing wear,"in your experience, what is the expected life of the taz 6 y axis bearings?  i would estimate less than 1000 print hours on my taz 6 and the rh side of the bed lifts > 5mm.  terrible vibration when the bed moves in the y direction.  is this common?","5mm is an abnormal amount of lift. either something sanded that bearing out, it fell out of the container, or the bearing container itself catestrophically failed and needs to be replaced. 0.5mm after 1,000 hours i would believe. you can try adjusting the bearing cups in or out to make more contact temporarily until new bearings can arrive, but if it is gouged out that bad i would check your y rod for a serious knife shaped burr."
spare parts question...,"hi, all. i recently purchased my first 3d printer, a taz 6, and have been experimenting with it a little. 

i did want to ask the regulars, what (non-3d printed) spare parts should i have on hand to minimize downtime? 

the second question is in regards to the gcode for the 3d printed parts on the sd card, what material are they printed from? i assume its either the ngen or pla due to the temperature but wanted to make sure. and which parts from this collection should i have on hand? 

thanks.

sennith","1. spare parts to have on hand in order of likelyhood of failure
a. small grain of rice fuses for the rambo board ( failure due to electrical pulse from moving the bed or x carriage by hand too quickly) 
b. a thermistor for the hotend (sometimes they just break, but usually force or electricity related)
c. a heater core for the hotend (these rarely fail but are only $3.) 
d. a nozzle (0.5mm, hexagon or e3dv6 nozzles are compatable here, general wear ) 
e. the 15 amp automotive blade style fuse for the bed (ive never actually seen one fail personally)
f. a replacement pei sheet (pei is a long term consumable, it will tend to lift over time and eventually need to be re-bedded and it is possible to tear it) 
g. it is possible but unlikely to crack the bed glass. 
h. the igus 12mm and 10mm bearings will wear over time, but you can ignore them for at least a year or two under even heavy loads. 
i. a spare belt (fraying rather than snapping is more likely) 
j. 608zz bearings (or 6082rs for the rubber sealed ones) the idler arm bearing will tend to over time clog up even with the sealed ones, and the idler bearings on the x and y axis will fail after 3-4 years of heavy use. 
k. a spare rambo board is expensive, but having a spare will minimize downtime
l. spare 30mm 5v fan and spare 24v 40mm fan for the hotend.  
a spare hexagon hotend to harvest parts from isn't a bad idea. 

2. the parts on the sd card (which you can also find those and newer versions on download.lulzbot.com ) are mostly printed out of abs plastic except for the squishy bed corners, green z nut rings and the squishy feet which are printed out of ninjaflex, or tpu (thermoplastic urathene) the most likely failure parts in order are: 
a. idler arm ( possible snap failure)
b. small gear (wear over time)
c. large gear (wear over time) 
d. the extruder body itself (wear over time, possible idler arm mount snap) 
of those parts the only one i have seen fail early is the idler arm. the newer ""beefy"" idler arm and latch prevents that. 

abs can be glued to full strength (chemical, not mechanical bond) so i keep a bottle of plastruct plastic weld on hand (abs formula). you also may want to grab some m3 and m5 heat set inserts and the m3 heat set insertion tip from mcmaster carr (which works ont he m5's as well) to rebuild all parts. 

the assembly guide documentation is here if you like: https://ohai.lulzbot.com/group/taz-6/ 

itworks3d.com is a good source of inexpensive used parts for spares, most of the other peices can be found in the lulzbot store as well."
dual extruder v3 nozzle type,"i'm thinking of getting a dual extruder v3. one think i'd like to do off the bat is change the nozzles to 0.4mm hardened steel. what type of nozzle does the v3 take? is it e3d volcano compatible?

thanks!","i don't think they recommend removing the nozzle... they don't carry spare nozzles in the store.


iirc,  e3d nozzles butt against the heat break.  so when changing the nozzle, as long as the heat break is constant and heater block doesn't rotate a full revolution, the nozzle should stay consistent.  as long as the nozzles are close, micro-adjustments can be made by rotating the right lead screw with the motors off.

i guess it would be easy enough to print a jig to ensure equal spacing between the heater block and heatsink, and/or nozzle to heat block.  if designed thoughtfully, the jig could also protect wires when removing the nozzle.

keeping nozzle materials/types consistent would be a good idea to account for thermal expansion.


that's probably my starting point if i need to cross this bridge... the .5 nozzle has stayed clog-free for me the past few years."
single extruder tool head compatible with taz 6?,"subject says it all.
i'm interested in putting a 0.35 nozzle on my taz 6. would buy a single extruder tool head if this does the job.
otherwise, i've got a spare v2.1 tool head that i could hack up the settings for, but i'd prefer to keep that as a spare 0.5mm because i have had parts break on the head and it's nice to have the spare to print whatever you need to keep going (not to mention, get back up and running in 5 minutes).

would prefer the detail of the smaller nozzle for some projects. i'm using a qidi tech i right now for such projects, but the small build plate is a bit limiting.","it's feasible with a little bit of work.

the taz 6 firmware and tool head uses a max x-axis end stop in addition to the z-axis probing wire connected to the heater block.

you'll need to add the z-axis homing wire to the tool head wiring harness and secure it to the heater block. you'll then need to either modify the taz 5 v2 tool head with a max x-axis end stop mounting point (for a usable end stop), or connect a new end stop to the max x-axis end stop connector on the rambo (end stop will not function). you can also bypass the need for the max x-axis end stop by turning off that feature in the firmware source files, recompiling, and flashing to your printer.

an easier alternative would be to purchase an all-metal hot end with 0.35 mm nozzle, cut the wires to length, add your grounding wire, terminate the new wiring, and install it into your extra v2.1 tool head."
taz 5 not extruding properly,"a while back, my school's taz 5 had a chip blow on the rambo. i replaced it with a new one sent by lulzbot, but ever since the printer has extruded fine for a couple of minutes then stopped. what might be causing this?","ok, so the fillament is most likely grinding out. when it stops, open the idler arm chamber and look at the fillament, if you see a ""c"" shaped section that looks like it was sanded away, and there is lots of plastic shavings in th chamber and in the hobbs of the hobbed bolt, you are grinding on feed for some reason. if thats the case, here are the steps to troubleshoot:

1. clean out the shavings from the hobbed bolt chamber and the grooves of the hobbed bolt. 
2. check that the idler arm bearing still moves freely with the arm unlatched. 
with the arm latched, measure between the washers on the idler arm tension bolts and ensure that you have 8mm or less (prefferably a bit less) space between the inside of the washers on either side of the tension spring. 
3. print a large. prefferably square (scale up a calibration cube for example) first layer then stop it and remove from the bed. now measure that layer thickness with calipers. is it pretty close to what you have set as a starting layer in cura? (example, if your starting layer is 0.35mm, does it measure 0.35mm after you pull it off the bed? a little difference here isn't a big deal as some plastics shrink as they cool, but if you have 0.35mm set and you are getting 0.25mm, you have the nozzle too close.) check all 4 corners of this first layer  and if any are thinner or thicker than the others, adjust that corner accordingly. 
4.  now start a print that is at least 5 layers tall. stop it at layer 5, and measure again. if you are significantly over or under what your set layer height is, you may need to run an extruder calibration and update your e-steps value. 

5. if all that looks correct and you are still experiancing grindout on longer prints, check your extruder barrel cooling fan. that unit sometimes failes in a still moving, but not pushing any air mode. replace it if necessary. particularily if you are getting grindouts on pla. 
6. look at your retraction values in cura, and try lowering them. 

other rarer things to check - if the extruder motor is getting extremely hot compared to the x or y motor, it may be failing. you may also want to check for operation of the cooling fan in your control box. 


try all that, if that doesn't do the trick let me know. there are a few other things to potentially check."
internal blower harness on second exturder (taz4 to 5),"i am trying to finish upgrading my taz4 to taz5 and i am confused about one thing. i am adding the internal blower harness, and the instructions were very straight forward. i am adding the internal harness to extruder #2 and the instructions indicate that i should attach it in the same spot where i have the internal blower harness for extruder one attached.... so i don't know where to go from here.

the end goal here, besides just finished the upgrade, is to use the v3 dual extruder. i am following the instructions https://ohai.lulzbot.com/project/lulzbo ... 3-install/ for installing the dual extruder on the taz5, and https://ohai.lulzbot.com/project/prep-t ... cessories/ for adding the internal blower harness to the second port.

a picture of the internals, with me holding the harness and the first harness from port #1 boxed in red. 




","i don't see a second connector. in steps 11 & 12 the first connector is where the harness from extruder one is connected and the second connector is the fan for the control box.

i can't seem to find the link again but i found another tutorial for something where the internal blower harness was hardwired into a power rail, since the fans are ""always on"". because i couldn't find the link i just wired both harnesses to the same connector, crimping a new connector onto both wires.

i was also trying to reference the actual taz5 designs. where are these pins connected in a stock taz5? it seems like they might be hardwired into somewhere."
taz 6 bed calibration,"is there someway to adjust the bed calibration of the taz 6?

currently, the upper left hand corner of the bed produces a fantastic 1st layer (filament nicely adhered to the bed). by the time i get to the lower right hand corner, i'm almost printing in air. it seems to be a fairly linear progression from the upper left (x,y) coordinate down to the lower right (x,y) coordinate (with less and less adhesion as you move along x and y).

is this something i can adjust?","i had similar problems with my taz6.  using a dial indicator mounted as a printhead, i found more than a 1mm difference between the back right and front left corners (after calibration).  this was using the cura (not cura2) firmware.  with the cura2 beta firmware it was sometimes better and sometimes worse because this firmware was only using a 3 point calibration to create a plane whereas the cura firmware was using all 4 calibration points and averaging the planes that are generated from those 4 points.

after going back and forth with support, i was sent a new aluminum plate.  using the cura2 firmware, this made things a lot better but not great.  i could print a full bed calibration print using pla if i applied glue stick to the bed (but not without the glue stick) because of the lowest corner.

updating to the latest firmware (which may or may not have been released yet, i was building it from source), it is now generally okay.  the newest firmware uses a different calibration algorithm that takes all 4 points into consideration and produces a better calibration (for me).  with this version and the new plate i successfully printed a full bed calibration print without a glue stick.  while it succeeded, it just barely succeeded having some minor issues in the corners (too close / too far from the bed).  i doubt i would be able to get 3 calibration prints in a row to succeed but it's close enough that i believe i could print a very large print using a glue stick to buffer the slightly too low points and it would work fine.

my take-aways for someone finding this topic are:

* don't rule out the plate being warped, but i'd suggest trying to verify that (i used a certified straight edge to check it).
* older firmware may be better than more recent firmware but worse than the very latest firmware

and, frankly, just calibrating off the 4 corners has some limits in how well you can automatically level the bed.  after trying to understand what was wrong with my printer i understand that it is unlikely to ever be 100.0% perfect.  calibration from the corners cannot capture a more complex problem like concavity or convexity in the build plate or non-planar deformations in the corners."
printinz on taz 6,"anyone used a printinz plate (zebra board) on a taz 6?
i've used them on flash forge with great success and i really like the idea of a removable plate. just don't know how well the extra 5mm in height would work with the auto-leveling on the taz 6 (in particular, is it going to be a problem during the auto leveling process?).","coparatech wrote:ttabbal wrote:i've done it on a mini. it works well. i had them clip the corners off to keep it removable. then i added some standoffs between the bed and the washer screws to increase the washer height to slightly above the print surface. note that they need to be conductive, plastic is no good. mine are brass standoffs for pcb mounting. then just dial in the z-offset to match the new setup. the auto-level works as always. i printed some abs clips to hold it down to the bed, the whole mess is held down with a couple binder clips. 

http://www.printinz.com/lulzbot/

hi ttabbal! i ordered one for my mini. i assume you need to bump the bed heat a few degrees to compensate for heat transfer loss, is that correct? any downside to the printz?

yes, the surface temp will be a little lower than you set the printer to. it doesn't seem to need as much heat as pei to hold the print. start low and work your way up. you can weld the print to the surface. i also find ramping the extruder up helps prevent that. the first layer goes down a little lower, then kick it up. 

downside... it warps a little with heat. so you have to take it off, flip it over, and hold it down while putting clips on. in practice, it's not a big deal. just something to keep in mind. and it's nice when a print is a little stuck, to take the plate off and flex it a little."
"new taz6, help with poor prints","just got a brand new taz 6 from the bf sale, it arrived yesterday and am super excited! need some help diagnosing a print issue that seems to be related to the left and right sides not being aligned. the printer makes noises that sound like the printhead is scraping over the existing print. especially when moving from the back-right to the front-left.

strange bubbling layers,"hey everybody. i am new to the forum and to 3d printing. i have had my taz 6 for about 3 weeks and probably have about 100 hours on it. i've experimented with various filaments and had some great results and some not so great. the prints i'm doing will be mostly for commercial use so i've been primarily using abs for many of my prints. i have worked out most of the bugs and am getting consistently good prints except for one issue that i haven't been able to track down. about a 1/4"" off the bed i will get about 10 to 15 layers of ""bubbly"" prints. it's not even consistent all the way around, it's only about half of the perimeter and it's on all locations of the bed. the rest of the print is very very good. so what gives? i've messed with extrusion rate, z offset, retraction and z hop and can't figure this out. below are some photos. the pic with 2 pieces next to each other were different prints from different days with basically the same settings, except a few minor changes. the three that are on the bed still all had this issue in the exact same spot. any ideas?

retraction enabled
bottom/top thickness - 2mm
fill - 25%
perimeters before infill - yes

bottom layer - 20
infill speed - 55
top/bottom speed - 45
outer shell - 40
inner shell - 50

on an unrelated note, why does my lcd screen read ""sleep....."" at random times in the middle of prints while it's still clearly printing?

thanks for any help!","that looks like insufficient cooling to me. the print is not cooled quite enough which makes the thin overhang curl upwards. then on the next layer the nozzle hits the curled up layer. this continues until it levels off after the overhang. i would try to add just a touch more cooling fan atleast when you are printing the overhang. you should not add too much though as abs starts to crack between layers if it is cooled too much. 

it also looks like you have a bit of banding on the vectical walls. i suspect if you wiggle the z-axis leadscrews, one of them is a bit loose and wiggles side to side. i had that issue and all that was needed was loosening up the green mount that holds the screw on the bottom, pushing it upwards and retightening the screws. after that it was rock solid and no banding."
taz 5 flexydually fans not running at any speed less than 100%,"hello,

i am a teacher at a middle school and we have a taz5.  we replaced the hot end with a flexydually a bit ago.  we've only done a little bit of printing with it, and while trying out some petg the other day, i realized that the fans on the hot end weren't running.  i was using simplify3d and when i open the machine control panel window, i have found that when i turn the fan speed up, it only goes on once i set it at 100%. additionally, at 100% the hotend also starts dropping in temperature.  anything less than turned up all the way causes the fan to stop running.  i tried incrementally adjusting the fan speed using m106 and it seems as though anything less than 98% isn't turning it on. 

for what it's worth, the lcd display on the taz5 is showing the speed at different %'s.  i've also tried printing/adjusting the fan speed using cura and i am finding the same thing.

i've searched the forums a bit, but haven't found anyone with the same problem.

thanks in advance for any help.","the fans used in the taz 6 (and in this case possibly the flexydualy) use different voltages than the ones that shipped with the taz 5. the fix is to edit the firmware with those voltages and settings. my taz (which is effectivly a modified taz 5 firmware at this point) has the same issue when running taz 6 style fans, and i haven't had a chance to track it down and see what the actual values that need fixed are. there may be an upgraded firmware preset you can take advantage of. the other option is tracking down the old style fans and installing them, but i don't have one of those to even guess what the make and model info was, plus they stopped using those for a reason."

1) the top screw mount is off so that the extruder does not sit down securely in the nest.  to me, that's not a big deal, take the die grinder out, elongate the hole, back in business.  i'm sure lulzbot will take care of it in the future, but to me, it is not a big deal.  i void warrantees on a daily basis without a second thought.

2) filament is a little tough to load.  i think i can deal with that, personally.  i generally load a full roll of filament and print until it is gone.  but if someone is changing colors frequently or changing colors on the fly, i can understand that being a problem.  i'm sure there is a design fix out there somewhere and i'm sure lulzbot will figure it out before too long.

3) filament cannot be removed if the hot end is cold.  it's just generally part of my work process to heat the hot end before removing filament.  ...unless i am oversimplifying things.

those are the only 3 things mechanically that i've heard of.

software wise, cura 2.6.52 seems to be rather buggy.  i've tried running it and ran into too many problems, not even related to dual extrusion.  i've resigned myself to sticking with cura 21.08.  i print with my v2 dual extruder without problem as far as software goes.  if i would get the v3, change the dual extruder offsets through calibration and maybe tweak the start2.gcode, i would think i could print without problem?  i like to be an early adopter on technology, but i tried cura 2.6.52 and just had to punt until the bugs got worked out.    am i oversimplifying that?  sometime, when i get time, i want to work on cura 2.6.52 and try to hash some stuff out, but right now i just need to print some things.

if i get one of the v3 dual extruders, am i setting myself up for massive disappointment...  or will i be able to deal with the quirks and make some awesome prints?  can i get around the problems or do the problems run deeper than i envision?

does the printhead run more stable than the second extruder of the v2 printhead?","ok, i see, so maybe i could tweak the end2 gcode.....  

keep the nozzle temperature on, move z up, then x and y somewhere safely out of the way, then extrude t1 10mm to soften, then retract t1 15-20 mm (some distance further than 10mm) then do the same with t0.   

then i would probably have to remove the filament and cut the end and reinsert it before the next print."
dual extruder 3 with flexi?,"i couldn't find much discussion or information on the recommended filaments for the new dual 3 ... but in looking at the models and the assembly workflow, it appears that the filament path is quite well supported the entire way to the hot end.  does that mean it might work with flexible filaments as well as hard ones?","hello cmidgely,

here you can see a polyflex print using the v3 dual extruder as a single tool head:






the v3 dual extruder is capable of printing flexible materials. through our internal testing we have found the polydissolve and pva stick very will to tpu’s (flexible filaments.) however, we have not fine tuned the profiles for optimal cosmetic results. we include all of our flexible material profiles in the experimental section of cura lulzbot edition, and can be used as a good starting point for making your own modifications. printing with flexible materials is recommended for advanced users on the v3 dual extruder. 

as we continue to work on cura lulzbot edition, we hope to have more supported materials in the future."
taz 6 dually - second extruder making contact with print volume,"we have recently installed the dually on our taz 6 however we are having difficulties when printing using only extruder 1 as we intend to do some of the time. both extruders were calibrated to the same height from the print bed and the first layer or so goes down fine but eventually extruder 2 starts to meet with the print volume causing it to 'scratch' it and in a recent print had sufficient enough force for the motor to skip resulting in vertical steps in the print. the problem seems to get worse as the print height increases suggesting it could be the z axis calibration but a test cube, with extruder 2 well out of the way, comes out perfect. i have tried adjusting the z offset mid print in the hope i can salvage it but this obviously isn't a permanent solution. can anyone offer any suggestions as to what i might be doing wrong or how we can reduce this? (i am a fairly new taz user). otherwise i feel i have no option other than to remove the dually until i need to print dual material or temporarily adjust the height of extruder 2 to prevent these collisions.  i have attached a photo mid print showing the problem (extruder 2 is on the right). thanks in advance.","tinted184 wrote: ?fri nov 17, 2017 5:26 am
so i managed to sort out the auto leveling issue, not sure how! however the second nozzle is still making contact with the print volume even after careful adjustment, slow printing and travel speeds and a 1mm 'hop' in an attempt to move out of the way while the print tools are in transition. i'm printing using only one extruder at the moment (rigid plastic) but obviously i'm going to get the same problem when adding in the ninjaflex.

i really don't know what else i can try and am going back to the single extruder and temporarily giving up on the dually. very disappointed to say the least, hopefully lulzbot can help me but any other suggestions are more than welcome. i have attached an image of the latest print with a clear line across the volume correlating with the point at which the second nozzle is making contact with the print volume. you may also notice considerable warping which again is disappointing for such a simple print with lulzbots recommended settings for pla. i didn't expect this with a printer of this cost am i expecting too much?


this is exactly why i’m terribly upset with my lulzbot taz 6 and dual v2 especially for its price.

but checj out the dual v3 they just released 2 hours ago. if you still have time hurry return the terrible v2 (30 days).

btw i’m keen on selling my dual v2, anyone interested please pm me."
how does the dualhead taz v2 compare to the v3?,"looks like v3 has the heads closer together to be used with meltable supports, does that limit the materials to using with the same temps? i'm new to dual printing and don't understand all the differences between the 3 dual head taz printheads. 

bought a taz 6 for black friday to add to the fantastic mini. ","thank you. the features section on the product page goes into more details as well. i'm going to wait for some reviews and software updates before buying , especially since it's not part of the bf sale. gives me time to sell the mini and learn a little more about dual head printing."
taz 5 homes and then moves up,"hi everyone,

my taz 5 started acting up. i had a hotend jam. after removing the nozzle, cleaning the hotend and reassembling it, i restarted the print. i have printed this same gcode file multiple times (at least 10) but this time something very weird happened.

the printer homes correctly (and if i manually home it works fine). however, after homing it moves up ~5.5mm (measured with calipers) before starting to print (on thin air, of course). i took a video but it doesn't show too well, i'm attaching it and the gcode file anyway. this happens regardless of if i print via sd card or via usb.

any ideas?

thanks,
-mario.","thank you for your help piercet.

i found the problem. the g28 z0.600 made the toolhead go slightly up... but my x axis somehow moved so it wasn't parallel with the bed. when it got to the printing position it was high up. i really don't know how that might have happened since, while i will sometimes move the x and y axis by hand i always use octoprint to move the z axis. anyway, manually turning the right threaded rod until the x axis was level fixed it.

thanks again!"
hexagon hoopla - hot end fell out,"greetings!

i am supporting a taz 5 with a hexagon extruder for a co-working space. 

purchased a new hexagon extruder to replace one that got jammed with pla. however as i was printing with it, the entire heater block came off like so:






is there any hope for repairing it? we have another new one on order, but would like to repair this one as a backup.","that appears to possibly be a knockoff hexagon (or possibly one of the 1.75mm ones?. the real ones that i have seen don't have an insert tube like that.  you can just buy a new barrel from itworks3d.com but they appear to be out of stock at the moment https://itworks3d.com/product-category/ ... r_hotends/ 

your other option is to glue the tube back in place using a thermal transfer epoxy. artic silver makes a good one that should work if you aren't printing nylon with it."
taz 6 error probe fail clean nozzle,"folks,

i just tried to run my first test print. i keep getting a probe fail clean nozzle message.  the nozzle looks clean.   any suggestions?  i am want this printer to work.

thanks.

taz6 z homing issues with standard tool head,"i've been having issues with my taz6 with the standard v2c .5mm tool head. it seems to be a firmware issue, because the printer works fine and has no trouble with our flexystruder or moarstruder. however, when i put the standard tool head on there and switch the firmware and printer profile over to that, instead of beginning a print or homing properly, it'll just keep pushing the extruder down on the z-axis, pushing against the bed. i've changed the z offset on the printer itself, but no luck, it just keeps doing the same thing (even at extreme settings like +10.00). has anyone else had this issue? it's a taz6, latest firmware, and i've tried it on both the last version and the new upgraded version of cura for lulzbot.","if you have a taz 5 v2c head it will not work, and will do what you describe. it is missing a x max switch on the right side of the extruder (among a couple other things). so will not position the bed correctly over the z min limit switch for the extruder head to hit and instead drives the tool head down on the back left corner of the heat bed. make sure you are using the v2.1(taz 6) tool head and not the v2c(taz 5) tool head."
taz 5 user looking for test print on taz 6,"hello all, i am a longtime taz 5 owner and use it to print molds for silicon injection. i am looking for someone with a taz 6 w/ moarstruder to do a test print of one of my molds, to see if the print speed and quality justifies moving up. i am willing to pay once you've had a chance to see the model and cura profile.

flexydually v2 and pva,"hi!

i just nabbed a flexydually v2 over the weekend and i've been having a great time with it. however, i wanted to know if i can safely use pva with the flexible extruder. i couldn't really find any documentation on the toolhead, unfortunately. 

thanks in advance! 

also - does anyone know where the source files are located? the directory is fairly barren as linked from the product page.","running pva through the flexible extruder should not cause any damage to the tool head, feel free to give it a go!

ditched my skirt for this prusa i3 mk2 style wipe feature i made for the taz 6,"not sure if anyone else runs into this but when i print skirts there is a decent chance they get pulled into the print. after i saw how the prusa i3 mk2 primed its nozzle by printing a line at the front of the bed where the printer never usually prints i got jealous. 

then i saw makers muse talk about replicating this feature in his startup script https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6csbj5965bk and though how hard can it be to tell the taz 6 to do the same thing. so i gave it a shot and i think i got it and even added an improvement to the process! 

my version will print the line in the front outside of the normal printing parameters like the mk2 but once it hits the end of the line i add a 5 second pause with the nozzle still in the extruded filament creating a small pool and cooling it off around the edge of the pool. then i jerk the head to the center of the bed and in the process minimizing/eliminating any stringing or pulling any part of the extruded line onto a printable part of the bed. 

here is my gcode to add to the end of your startup script:

;prime the nozzel stage
g1 z0.4 e0 f1000              ; extrude filament back into nozzle
g1 y-8.0 f500.0		  ; move out of the print volume
g1 x0.0 f1000.0		  ; start purge line
g1 x250.0 e40 f1000.0	  ; finish purge line
g4 p5000				  ; wait to let the plastic cool a little 
g1 x125.0 y125.0 f15000 ; move to middle to rip plastic off tip
g92 e0                               ; set reset extruder position to 0
m117 taz printing...          ; lcd status message

in the cura profile i have it retracts the filament while the head parks to heat up after probing the bed so i had to adjust it to put to put the filament back in the nozzle after it gets up to temperature. if you use the same startup script that comes out of the box with lulzbot cura then you may not have to adjust that part but just an fyi.

with this at the end of the start up a script the nozzle is ready to go so i recommend to go into the settings of whatever slicer you use and disable all skirt settings. in lulzbot cura on windows all you need to do is press ctrl+e to get to the advanced settings and set all the skirt settings to 0.","great idea. i have a prusa mk2s, with mk3 on the way. i too was jealous of the prusa prime method. 
for one thing the blob at beginning didn't always stick to bed, and it would get caught in your skirt or model. 
another thing the blob wasnt always enough filament extruded, especially if you cancelled a print before doing a new print.


line works awesome, thanks for sharing."
severe warping printing spare parts using chroma strand abs,"good afternoon lulzbot users.

we bought a taz 6 to print fit and function fixtures to check brackets we fabricate.  we use cura as our slicing software and when printing using polylite pla, the printer has performed fantastic. we received our printer 2 weeks ago and have already used over 2kg of pla.

i am in the process of making a few spare parts before i turn the printer over to our fixture team and ordered the preferred abs chroma strand to make the spare herringbone gears and extruder parts i felt may be suspect in the case of an accident.

our lulzbot taz 6 is open to office air.  with the pla, this has not caused any issues.  however, this was disastrous as our prints warped causing a crash and the blowing of one of the quick acting fuses for the servos on the rambo board.  

after cleaning up and replacing the fuse, i fabricated a cardboard box to cover the unit and act as a heat box to keep the abs from being effected by air drafts.  i use this technique on my own personal davinci 1.0a and it helped when printing abs.  is the heat box required/recommended when printing abs?

i am using the easy settings in cura on standard moder with chroma strand 1800 selected.  extruder temp is 245 and bed is 80.  i have used a glue stick on the bed as well.    

any suggestions to what i need to do?  i am printing the (4) corner posts for the clear acrylic cover from printed solid.com  i still need to print the other spare parts as well.  looking for suggestions to print as well as the parts on the machine are.  

thanks,

archie adamisin
burlington, ky","yep, use an abs profile.
ideally, use the factory .gcode to the parts so you get factory equivalent strength in the parts.
here's the file for the large herringbone gear for printing with abs on a taz 6. just load the .gcode into cura or onto the sd card and print. http://devel.lulzbot.com/taz/olive/prod ... _blk/taz6/

i can't find a pre-sliced .gcode file for the small herringbone gear for printing on the taz 6. maybe support could post one if it exists?

jamming hexagon print head,"hey all, 

i have an issue here with a hexagon print head. it keeps jamming a stripping the abs filament.  

i have tried different types of abs and different nozzle sizes (0.2 and 0.35) and i keep having the same issue.  
the one common thing i keep seeing is when i pull the filament to cut off the hogged out spot the filament always has a shell of filament stuck to the side of it.  






it is almost like its backing up inside of the hot end.  also, with the print nozzle still hot and set to 245 you really have to yank hard to get the filament removed from the hot end. 

i will also add, its not a clog because i can feed the filament back in and immediately go back to printing. 

anyone else seen this?","ok, back for a follow-up report.  
after aligning everything like kcchen_00 suggested.   the printing was better, but i was still having occasional jams.  now when it jams i don't see the shell of plastic creeping back up the filament.  it completed several 10hr print jobs back to back and then it jammed on two jobs back to back on the same gcode that it just ran successfully.   
piercet wrote:are you running a stock nozzle? if the threaded part of the nozzle isn't long enough you may have a gap between the nozzle top and the down tune into the heater block.
yes, i checked this today.  measuring the threaded length of the nozzle and the depth of the heater block.  if i do have a gap its 0.1mm or less.  

today i removed the nozzle and loosened the two mounting bolts.  with everything loose, i inserted a piece of filament in reverse from the heated block up to the hobbed bolt.  once there i clamped down the idler and snugged down the mounting bolts for the hot end.  with the mounting bolts tight i opened the idler clamp, removed the filament and installed the nozzle.  

after studying how the hexagon hot end is over sized to the filament, i am somewhat suspecting that my issue is heat creep.  therefore i printed the taz 5 40mm fan shroud that itworks3d has  https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1878514  and replaced the one that mounted the fan on the left side. 

i will be monday before i can test out the changes."
squish and stringy appearance,"we have 2 lulzbot taz 6's here.  i love the machines and we have had great reliability with them.

however, i have one of the two machines that always visually looks different (and has different print quality than the other) and the issue is always the same.

it acts like it doesn't squish the first layer enough.  and the individual passes, (as they lay next to one another) in a given layer do not look connected.  imagine that beginning layer (even subsequent layers) as looking like two lines of rope laying next to another instead of two lines of rolled-up playdoh that you've set your hand on and squished a little so that the two rolls tie into one another.  its like one pass is totally separate from the next.  i have attached photos to illustrate the issue.

the other machine has never had this issue.

i have played with the percentage on the first layer as well.  i always call it the squish - i think the default is .40 of the normal thickness - but it never seems to change.  

the issue is slightly better with pla (but not ever gone) and more pronounced in abs.  

can you offer any suggestions?

taz6 dual extrusion question,"hi all,

first off i love our taz6 printer, we use it multiple times a week for prototyping and functional projects.  i also purchased the dual extruder tool head and here's my question:
is there any way to print two different colored filaments in the same project?  in the example i provided where it says ""text"" i would like that to be printed with a blue filament and the rest of the piece white.  i use sketchup 2017 to design all my projects but have no idea how to ""tell"" cura or whatever to print the whole thing white and the ""text"" blue!  is this even possible?  thanks in advance!","yes.  you'll need to save the each color as separate stl files.

so in your example, each color will need to be a group.  create the main part (with the depression for the the lettering) and group. export that group as aaa.stl.  then create the inset text (outside the main part group), group and save as bbb.stl.  make sure to keep the same origin for both.

import aaa.stl and bbb.stl into slicer.  as long as you kept the same origin, they the two stls should line up."
abs sticks to plate like insanity! help.,"have a taz 6. but for those filaments that stick ""too"" well to the pei sheet i like to use blue tape. i find it better than using pva glue in cases like yours because it releases much easier than glue for me. also i'm never sure if i'm using to little or to much glue.  bottom finish won't be as nice though.","it works best to remove abs prints with the pei bed at 50c. the print sticks harder to pei at printing temp and at room temp than it does at 50c. if you continue to have problems, adjust your z end stop counter clockwise a quarter turn to lessen the first layer squish a bit. that should help. you might have to run a few test prints at different z stop settings to get just the right first layer squish."
first layer issues.,"hello,

let me start off by saying this is my first post on the forum, my first 3d printer, and my first 3d printing experience.

that said, i have done a tonne of reading and learning since i received my taz 6 from amazon two weeks ago. sadly my taz 6 does not seem to be working very well out of the box, as i am not having much success getting great looking prints out of the printer. perhaps i am expecting too much from this technology, but i hope that is not the case.

i am having massive issues with my first layer of my prints. i always ended up with little to no detail in the first layers of a print, and a relatively massive elephant foot on my prints.

i read the ""a strategy for obtaining great prints"" post, which was great, but i was never able to print the first cylinder at 0.2mm. it always failed to print and just left a bunch of stringy blobs on the surface. i believe that it was related to z-index offset being completely wrong, so i played around with it lifting it up from the factory setting of -1.165. i tried going up in 0.005 increments until i hit -1.150 and i still was not getting a good first layer.

at this point i calibrated the extrusion length following the taz 6 instructions and determined it was substantially off from the factory settings, as well as calibrated the x, y and z esteps as they were also substantially off.

i was using mg chemicals (improved) pla, but switched to polymaker to see if that was the culprit for the bad first layer prints. that also did not lead to a solution.



 various z-index offsets 


you can see from this image that the -1.155 z-index offset left a very smushed first layer on the bed. so i took drastic measures and went to -1.010 z-index offset. this immediately showed me much more detail than the printer ever had, but it seemed a little light on the bed as there were small gaps in the layer. so i dropped it to -1.020 and things looked better, and i figured i was in business!

so off i go and start a print of 4 pieces with that setting, but low and behold things were not great and two of the parts did not stick to the bed at all.

i now dropped the z-index offset to -1.065 which was again a ""drastic"" change and i started the prints. this time i noticed that they were sticking better, but that again each print in each area looked different and stuck differently to the bed as well.

now i contacted support and they suggested the nozzle may be dirty, thus the self-leveling was not working properly. so i cleaned the nozzle as well as i could, downloaded a few level calibration stl files from thingiverse and attempted to print them on the full bed.

here is a very long boring and poorly shot video of the calibration sequence. no issues touching the washers at all. https://youtu.be/65-lgwmg3_s

 level calibration print squares 




 front left square 




 front right square 


both the upper left and lower right sections are printing very light on the bed, the centre isn't bad and the front left and top right areas are ok, but maybe a bit smushed. overall not a great result, and i have had many similar failures like this. more photos of various level calibration prints. https://photos.app.goo.gl/7i5mwjzhtqpyr7dc2

i have contacted lulzbot support by email and not received what i think is a useful answer yet. they suggested cleaning my nozzle (it is clean), replacing the wiping pad (it is new for all intents and purposes), and sanding my bed with 2000 grit sandpaper and water / propyl alcohol mixture (it is essentially brand new.)

i personally think my bed is malformed, but maybe that is not the issue and someone here can help me figure out the issue before i send this printer back to amazon and write a bad review.

any and all suggestions are welcome..

thank you.

drewread","hi piercet,

thanks for the lengthy reply, i do really appreciate the time you took, and will try to reply in detail below.
piercet wrote: ?fri nov 03, 2017 2:21 am
ok, there are a couple of things. first off, the lulzbot profiles are designed for brand new printer users and tend to emphasize good bed adhesion over a perfectly formed first layer. specifically there is a ""first layer overextrusion"" setting that is deliberatly set to extrude something like 15-20 percent on a first layer to ensure that prints, particularly abs stick to the bed. you as a brand new 3d printer shouldn't touch that setting, but if you did want to, you can safely lower it and improve the phenomenon known as elephant's foot.


as soon as i attempted to make the print that i am trying to work on, i noticed the massive elephant foot on my first print. it is two halves of an extrusion which i had hoped to prototype with this technology. both sides are exactly the same and when rotated 180 degrees they lock together. initially the parts could not connect because of some slicing issues (the extrusion was too fine for the nozzle i have on this printer), but i quickly figured that out and modified the model to match my printer's nozzle size.

once i solved the nozzle size issue i quickly noticed the elephant foot after my next attempted print. it had always been there, but wasn't really an issue for the rocktopus (as it had no straight edges to see it on,) and it didn't cause any issues with the fidget spinners i printed for the kids. 



 mg chemicals navy blue improved pla - original z-index offset (-1.165) - elephant foot 




 mg chemicals white improved pla - oem z-offset - 110% flow first layer - elephant foot 


you can see it is very pronounced on these early model attempts (images above,) so i looked into how i can get a better print. i quickly discovered the first layer flow rate factory setting of 110%, and reduced it to 100%. at this time i also calibrated my extruder steps, as they were also substantially off using the factory setting.



 mg chemicals white improved pla - oem z-offset - 100% flow first layer- elephant foot smaller but still present 


things got a bit better, but the elephant foot was still there (see image above.) at this time i decided to try building the model with the side flat on the bed as well as vertically, this is when i really noticed how smushed into the bed my first layer was. i had absolutely no detail in the text at all, in fact some of it was completely smushed together, this indicated a z-index offset issue (see image below.) so this is when i started to try to adjust this as above.



 z-index offsets 


the point to all that is that i did find the initial flow rate setting, and have tried anywhere from 90% first layer flow rate, to the factory 110%. the only way to reduce the smudging (smearing?) i was experiencing was to raise the z-index offset. which has now gotten me closer to where i had hoped to be out of the box, the parts actually fit together now, but i cannot print like this on different parts of the bed, as the prints stick differently everywhere. sorry that i forgot to mention that in my first post.

next, there are three things that occur with a moving bed 3d printer bed geometry that can affect prints independent of leveling. 1. if the bed is installed at a slant or at an angle to the main frame, the geometry will not be square. this can be due to something as simple as a piece of wire stuck between the lower main frame extrusion and the upper bed extrusion, or improperly aligned mounts potentially due to shipping. a symptom of this is sometimes thinner extrusions front to back. uneven bed washer spacers can also sometimes do this 2. if one of the leadscrews is off of level, or has a slipping motor coupler, you can get thinner extrusions right to left. 3. the bearing rods themselves are unsupported in the middle. that means they are typically higher at the ends than in the middle in the z axis. the y axis rails have a heavier load but it is more spread out, the x axis load is lighter but is a point source load, though the 6 rails are thicker than the 5's were so that is not as much a concern. the point being that you get what appears to be an apparent hump in the middle of the bed. this is normal, and it is usually minimal enough that subsequent layers correct for the issue. or you can go crazy and mod your printer to extrusions or linear rails, etc. 


in relation to point 1, it is my understanding that the flex mounts are simply there to push the bed up onto the washers, the thickness of the washers is used in calibration, along with the z-index offset, to determine bed level mathematically. in theory as long as the bed is pushed up to the bottom of the washers, and the 4 washers are of the same thickness then the math that is done will ""auto level"" the bed virtually. the only thing for me to check here would be the thickness of the washers for consistency, which i will do this evening. the rest of the alignment is seemingly irrelevant as the levelling math removes that from our equation, in fact i cannot level the bed physically if i wanted to.. there is simply no physical way to do it (unless i have missed something here.)

in relation to point 2 and 3, the first layer issue is diagonal on the bed, so the left/right and front/back issue is compounded. i don't think it is the leadscrews in this case, which would indicate the issue at either the front or the rear of the bed, not different on either side of both. sag is also not my issue, as it happens differently on each side and front to back. this also eliminates unlevel z-axis travel (which i have checked already) as it would be out of level on the same side front to back and it changes sides as the bed travels.

this issue is obviously complex, but it is happening in what seems like a diagonal fashion across the centre of the bed. 
piercet wrote: ?fri nov 03, 2017 2:21 am
there are also dozens of other variables. are your idler tension bolts tight enough? are they slipping more and more as a print progresses, potentially grinding powder into the hobbed bolt and making squares printed later thinner because there isn't enough grip? possibly. is the temperature too high and the barrel cooling fan not cooling enough and you are getting bore lock. is your extruder calibrated properly? is your fillament diameter set properly in cura? is the fillament you are using actually staying consistant in diameter and formula (cheap chinese fillaments often aren't either of those) are you using too much or two little part cooling fan. etc. are your belts tight enough? too tight? 


aside from the fact that i am not getting off of the first level before i see this issue (thus eliminating the thought that this may happen over multiple layers.) the filament is not slipping (no powder inside of the bore gate), the extruder e-steps have been properly calibrated and i have checked the various filaments used for size and consistency. i have also tried various filament manufacturers as i mentioned to eliminate a bad filament from the equation. 
piercet wrote: ?fri nov 03, 2017 2:21 am
the point being you should download and print calibration objects to identify what needs corrected. calibration cubes are a good start, measure them after cooled in xyz, thats a good way to eliminate z axis and elephants foot issues, then move to more advnaced ones and measure accordingly. if you find you have an issue that corresponds to an x or y direction, focus your troubledhooting there. 


i already did this, in fact i made my own set of calibration steps. i have calibrated every fraction of a mm on this machine that i could, using the information from the lulzbot website. i am confident that all of the x,y,z and extruder esteps are well calibrated (far better than they were from the factory.) 
piercet wrote: ?fri nov 03, 2017 2:21 am
the printer out of the box is a solid printer and will do great work if you know what you are doing, but there is some skill involved with using it, especially with such a large bed. you will encounter similar issues regardless of which printer you play with, even mine from time to time.. the 1.155 z axis is likely correct (or at least pretty close) once you account for the first layer overextrusion. i'd take a closer look at your front left washer assembly and measure the distance from top of washer to the bed mount plate and see if it differs. the front rght looks close to the thickness of the rear ones, and the middle one should, due to gravity and the apparent difference in the bed in the bed, be slightly thicker.  some slicers can be coaxed to account for that.


i'm sorry, but i fail to find a solution in your post that helps with the indicated issue, but i do sincerely appreciate the post. maybe the additional photos will help lead to a solution.

taz 6 ringing/resonance/ghosting along the z-axis,"greetings,
 
writing to this forum in hope of possible solution.

i purchased my initial taz 6 unit on 14th of december from microcenter. after installing the printer, i produced a roctopus print with ngen standard cura profile which had slight ringing on the surface.
right after that i started to get familiar with abs and produced a 3d benchy printed with standard abs profile with local abs fillament supplier. once first abs print was done, i noticed more pronounced ringing same as ngen's roctpous print.
the reason that it wasn't as obvious as abs is because ngen is considerably easier to print due to ability of using cooling. my project requires strictly abs print workflow, because final model will be smoothened in ultrasonic acetone chamber, see the link for details (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pivh4dm3ysw)
at that point i started to troubleshoot the issue.
first i went through numerous forum posts and tried to find a solution that would eliminate/decrease this artifact. this allowed me to get more familiar with structural components of the printer and get a good general knowledge on it.
next thing was to reach out to lulzbot tech support team. they kindly gifted their time and started to troubleshoot the issue together with me. we went through calibration procedures indicated on the ohai support portal, purchased village plastic abs to ensure that imperfections are not due to the locally purchased abs (which in all honesty is a great product). purchased printed solid enclosure case to make sure that ambient temp during printing remains stable.
none of the approaches delivered improvements to this issue. after many tweaks and fixes, support team advised that we tried all the options and the unit has to be replaced.
after printer has arrived to facility and diagnosed, it was determined that toolhead was faulty.
once i received the second unit, i noticed numerous upgrade on the structural components which gave me a confidence that this unit will produce considerably improved print quality.
started to print with good high quality abs fillaments together with village plastic and observed similar ringing across the print surfaces as per initial unit.
then i made sure everything is lined up and belts are properly tensioned (great belt tension out of the box). upgraded printing surface to buildtak(so far the only good experience in terms of upgrades) which allowed me to print abs with 75 degrees on build plate and still provide great adhesion. also made first layers to look great.
still there is ringing/ghosting on the prints... 
lastly we tried yesterday to adjust e-steps, fully turn off the heated and print z resonance tower.
the issue is still present and i'm in a very though situation as my initial plan was to provided 3d printed parts to customers and make profit.
currently and this is 100% my reality. running low on the budget have no working solution to start earning income from this project.

attached images are the latest printed 3d scanned artifact consists from 3 sections (later been glued together). the headdress and bottom section has a layer height of 0.1mm which is considerably high, face section is 0.2mm medium quality. all sections been printed on standard unchanged settings.
what i get in these prints, is observed as a resonance pattern coming from some loosen/misaligned or damaged component. changing basic print setting, simply expands or shrinks the effect.


another note regarding acetone smoothing, it's a post process solution which after such printed ringing effect recreates wavy smooth surface, see attached.

lastly, all the structural components been check for any lose play in them, belts are tight out of the box in good condition still.

please address this matter and help to find peace in this situation. 
 
thank you,
 
vugar","hmm, it does line up pretty close. take a look at your z rods and their bearings and see if it looks like there are any gaps in the contact pattern between the inner bearing slide surface and the rods. if there is, consider popping the bearings out of the sockets, wrapping a bit of scotch tape around the body then reinserting them, being careful not to create too much pressure. it may also be that the motor allignment on the z motor couplings or the motors themselves is slightly off. after taking a picture to record the origional position, try loosening the z motor mount bolts on both sides, then run the z axis up and back down slowly, then re tighten the mount bolts. this can remove excess side load on the leadscrew. you can also try re adjusting the leadscrew couplings. if they are off even a few degrees, it can create excess force on the side of the leadscrew. 

one thing you can also try to see if the leadscrews are indeed the cause, is to temporarily remove the upper leadscrew mount bearings and then try a print. if that noticeably improves the surface down near the bed and to the middle of the print, you may be dealing with a leadscrew that isn't straight. i do not recommend running in that configuration permanently as there are some potential wear and deflection side effects, but it's a good way to see if thats what is going on. you may also want to try lubricating the leadscrews with white lithium grease, as that can tend to moderate the effects somewhat."
print quality problem,"hi,

its been a month i just got mu lulzbot taz6.
it has great looks as a ready to run 3d printer with good bed leveling feature.
however, i just printed out two parts which seemed to have problems with the layers on the outer and inner shell.

how to rectify these print quality issues ?

i think the bottom piece your idler is not tight enough and your filament is slipping. check the idler chamber for any signs of shavings or powder. tighten both  idler arm spring bolts. it could also be z wobble, but that's too severe to match the leadscrew so inconsistent extrusion is a more likely suspect. the top picture also shows some signs of underfeed. you also will want to measure your exact filament diameter and make sure that number is in cura. the default diameter is 2.85mm, if you are actually at 2.67mm for example, you will under extrude unless you adjust that.


which bottom piece? can you point and tell me?
i believe it to be z wobble. the lead screw on the left side of gives jerk.
i just checked the filament diameter it is near to 2.9mm, i kep the settings at 2.85 mm.
also now there seems to be a leveling problem too.
whatsapp image 2017-10-31 at 09.42.47.jpeg

the bottom picture is what i meant by bottom piece. the lighter color more rounded one. 

there may be some z wobble occurring, but i don't believe it is all z wobble simply because it doesn't continue all the way up the part. it's rare that wobble stops midway. you can check by holding the part up against the lead screw and seeing if the offset matches exactly. it looks more to me like your extruder is periodically extending quite a bit less than it should and then recovering. idler tension usually causes that, but it could also be a failing heater or thermistor. 

your adhesion issue us because your z offset setting in cura needs adjusted closer."
"print quality subpar, photo included","hi everyone,

my name is pete and i am brand new here.

quick background... i would consider myself a very amateur user of 3d printers.  i use them for prototyping designs of products i manufacture based upon a patent i hold.  my company is reflo ltd, if anyone wants to know.  i am from the cleveland, ohio area.

i originally had a wood framed flashforge.  worked fine for getting basic prototypes together to test function. however, anything bigger than the print area had to made in sections and glued up.

i recently purchased a lulbot taz 6.  love that i can print all of my currents needs in one piece... however i am having some issues with the quality of print, even at finer resolutions.

my stl file was produced at a extremely high resolution, since most of my prints are cylindrical and i want to avoid facets along the face. 

i am using inland pla, sold at microcenter where i purchased the taz 6 about 2 weeks ago.

the issue i am having is that my prints are showing steps between layers and an ugly run along what i assume is the end of path in the cylindrical print.

i was printing with the shell setting at 15mm (to ensure a completely solid fill by going way beyond the thickness of my print)  i had infill set at 0.  perhaps this is the source of my problems?  i did just change it to 1.5mm shell and 20% infill to see if there are notable changes.

i hope that you don't mind that i chose to come here instead of print a dozen different items with various settings to work out bugs.  i figured there is no sense in trying to reinvent the wheel.

i have attached a pic of my last print to illustrate the issue.  i'm not sure what other setting would be relevant but i can share whatever is needed.  i am just not sure what to share.

i would hope to be able to produce a high quality print for a presentation without a ton of hand work after printing.




","you are showing less wall voids. that's an improvement. next up, you need to adjust your extrusion by printing calibration objects and adjusting accordingly. a hollow walled cylender is the hardest possible thing to print, and you cannot do so unless your printer is dialed in. some of that is factory, some of that is settings, but a big portion of that is fillament diameter and fillament profile (dan speed, print temperature, number of shells, etc.) for example, the default fillament diameter setting is 2.85mm. if your fillament actually measures 2.95mm in diameter on average, you will be overextruding on every layer by 0.04 percent. you are either way overextruding, or way under extruding. measure the wall thickness at the thin point and the thickest point. whichever one is closest to the actual diameter you were trying to print is the direction you need to adjust. 

you aren't looking at z banding or z wobble here, because it's not consistant and it doesn't match up with the leadscrew threads. you are looking at inconsistant extrusion leading to layers of various thickness, which is causing the divots and thick sections you are seeing. the more i'm looking at it, the more i think you might be underextruding a bit, and getting thinner towards the end of the wall, then catching up on layer changes. but it could be the other way around. 

you need to check settings and print calibration objects to figure out exactly what is going on. print a 40mm calibration cube, does it end up exactly 40mm on all sides after cooling? run a 100mm extrusion test. mark fillament exactly 110m from the top of the extruder and slowly extrude 100mm of it. does the mark end up exactly 10mm from the top of the extruder? if not, your e-steps are off. run overhang tests, run bridging tests. print a benchy or 4. until you have it dialed in, don't bother trying to print another hollow wall cyelnder, it won't work and it's not due to the hardware."
moarstruder external fill pattern,"i know the moarstruder is intended for speed over appearance but just curious if anyone has been able to achieve neater external fills or has any suggestions. i have tried the normal and fast profiles in cura as well as an s3d profile that was cloned from cura except using the concentric pattern also on both slicers i have tried various temperatures but they all yield the same result.

i really know nothing about the moar extruder except that you can lay down lots of plastic pretty quickly with it.
just looking at your infill pattern, it would appear that whatever material you are using is running way to hot.
the infill should be extruding as a good line with no melting and goobering plastic all over the inside of your object.
even though i know nothing about moar, i am interested in getting one.

all i can suggest is to turn down your moar temperature and use fans to cool you layers depending on your material.

taz 6 large model splitting (pla),"hey all,

i've seen posts of people having issues with splitting using abs, but nothing about splitting with pla. i've read that building an enclosure may help, but i'm not sure how to go about this. sometimes the splitting is minor and sometimes it completely ruins the model. i have the temp set to 210 c and i make sure to have about 20% fill and i always create a brim and supports. is there anything i can do to help reduce this from happening?","that sure as heck doesn't look like pla to me. pla doesn't lift in the corners. if it is pla its a wierd formulation. if it were me i'd try printing it with the bed at 110 and the nozzle at 230 and see if it improves adhesion. if it does, that's abs, not pla. the only other thing i can think of is if you have the bed heater completely cold."
taz 6 just stopped working???,"i've had this printer for about 2 weeks.  this weekend i was able to run a number of prints and making adjustments to the printing settings in cura when i went to start another print (probably my 10th or so) the printer made some erratic movements and in cura it repeatedly displayed a notice that ""cold extrusion prevented"" or words to that effect.  since then, i have been unable to get cura to connect to the printer and produce a print.  it tries connecting for a longer than normal period then it says ""closed"".  interestingly, the  lcd flashes as if it is connecting (as it has done with every previous print) but then fails to connect.  i've changed no settings in anything other than cura.

taz 6 rambo 1.3l heat sinks,"can someone clarify this?

i bought a taz 6 a few months ago with a serial number in the 24000 range. i was about to start a 20+ hour print but ran across several comments on the internet about issues with the z axis controller overheating due to its heat sink falling off. to prevent possible damage to my unit, i decided to open the box and check this out before starting the print. to my surprise, there were no heat sinks on the board at all! the board is a rambo 1.3l. further checking into this revealed a lulzbot service bulletin instructing owners of earlier units to remove the heat sink entirely.

so i am a bit confused.
1) was it determined that the factory heat sinks caused problems and simply were not needed?
2) was there a board change to correct this that didn't require heat sinks (does the ""l"" in the version refer to low power or something)?
3) are taz 6 units supposed to be shipping without heat sinks now?
4) if so, any benefit to adding them back on with proper thermal transfer adhesive?
5) can i run my 20+ hr print without heat sinks safely without risk of damage or decreased life of the motors/electronics?

thanks!","piercet wrote: ?sun oct 29, 2017 12:12 pm
1) they fall off and short the board sometimes, and with a proper fan they aren't necessary. 
2) no, l is the version after version k. the motor drivers don't get all that hot if you have a cooling fan on them. 
3) yup. the new ohai kit pictures for the latest assembly instructions does not show them https://ohai.lulzbot.com/project/taz6-c ... bly/taz-6/
4) longer motor chip life assuming they don't fall off and destroy your void, also that would probably actually void the warranty. 
5) yes, unless you put the control box inside an enclosure which will melt it even with the chips so don't do that.


thank you piercet for the clarification. i did see the assembly instructions you linked to, but that actually added to my confusion. in section 6, it shows the heat sink installed and even labels the ic (u17) in the first picture. it leads one to believe that there is an important step involving that ic and the heat sink but there is no mention of u17 in the instructions, so perhaps they just have outdated photos, but still... confusing.

i got a bag of the small heat sinks for raspberry pi boards and proper thermal adhesive. it's really tempting to just add them to keep everything cooler. then again, the rambo board is less than $200 so it wouldn't be a huge expense to replace if it failed after years of use.... i would like to keep my warranty in tact.

help with moarstruder error: tool head not stopping at z endstop,"installed and flashed the firmware.

thanks","that's an electrical connection issue most likely. it's possible the nozzle is electrically isolated from the heater block, but it's more likely that the ground wire is loose or disattached at that block or at the harness pin. you can check by tracing the wire from the block to the harness plug, and then using a multimeter to check for conductivity. if it works with other heads fine the harness and the bed are likely wired ok."

so i am printing in pla (white for background and black for lettering) and when i got to the point where i thought i should switch between white and black i paused the print in cura. i switched the colour, did an extrude to get all of the white out and then in cura pressed resume. 

this is what i ended up with. i don't know if it is clear from the picture but the black is offset by a good inch to the right.

how do i do a second colour that is lined up with the first? 



other questions that i have yet to find answers for:

1. even if i pick the material do i have to also set the temperatures in the control menu?
2. which software is easy to begin for designing my own stl files?","cool first project brother.  personally i've never swapped materials mid way through a print, but i'm not sure if manually pausing the print is the way to go.  if you change to the expert settings and then go to the plugins tab, there should be a ""pause at height"" plug in that should streamline the filament swap process.  again, i've never used it but it's worth a shot.

taz 4 left & right z motors get out of sync,"so this past week it's happened to me twice that the left and right z axis motors will get out of sync. the first time it happened i was near the machine and it did it when homing the z axis after a 80mm tall print, part way down i heard a ratcheting sound and it stopped. nothing collided, there was nothing in the way and the nozzle was still a good 10mm or more away from the heated bed.

i did not think much of it just thought it was a fluke. i leveled it all back up again and printed another dozen or more prints then tonight i left the room during a print (rocktopus) and came back to about 1/4 of the print done and the rest in a ball around the extruder. i used software to try and move the z axis but it was stuck so i measured the distance of the extruder rods to the aluminum bed and it was off by 14mm so one of the motors slipped again.

i keep the drive and smooth rods clean and i keep lubriplate (lithium grease) on the screw rod. so, i have never opened the control box on my printer, is this current thing that i can adjust? and if so where can i find some instructions on proper adjustment. or is one of my motors drying?

i rely on this printer almost daily so i would appreciate any help.","i just took my whole x/z axis apart because of that noise and actual binding of the z axis.

it looks to me like there is an issue with the alignment of the carriages on the z axis. specifically, the hole centerlines from  left to right of the xaxis rods. when you push on the z carriages at the back where the x rods are, the carriage will want to twist and bind up on the leadscrew. it looks like the plastic right by the leadscrewnut touches the leadscrew and causes the binding.

as far as i can tell, the construction of everything seems to influence this. since nothing is square, i get good motion on part of the z stroke, but not others. i think their trick is to assemble the entire machine somewhat loose...

the telltale sign was pulling the xrods out of the left side plastic holder. the rods want to be about 1/2"" further back than the hole they are being shoved into. when you shove it all together, that tweaks the zcarriages and will cause the binding on the leadscrew.

i have pulled the frame diagonally and tightened the bolts back down. i have loosened the screws and pushed the leadnut over in the plastic to give clearance to the leadscrew. i have loosened and moved both the xbearing and the xmotor mount as far to one side as i could (opposite ways). you can do this by removing the 4 bolts on the aluminum bracket to get to the 3rd screw hidden behind the frame (nice). this still does not get the left/right holes to be on center, but it helped a lot. i think the design is just wrong, with the holes in the wrong place.

next, you will have to play with the set screws on the xshafts, and the tension on the x belt. i was tempted to leave one side loose, but the belt tension would not like that. pry the carriages apart or together, then tighten the set screws and tension the belt. then see what happens. it will bind, of course, so iterate several times until you get it the best you can. make sure the left/right carriages are level, without one higher than the other (normal calibration step...).

i hope that helps. the real fix does not look too easy. either move the location of the zxaxis assembly on one of the sides (which means new motor bracket and upper bearing bracket - which can be printed, minus the brass heat inserts...) or redesign the aluminum plate on one side to move the one of the xrod mounts. i guess you could slot the aluminum - but that means the bolt holes and the rod holes. 

that was a good 4 hours, so be prepared...

well, looking at it again, i see everything ""should"" line up (per the design), but doesn't in real life. so there must be an issue with the hole perpendicularity thru the xbearing block/x motor block. i could open them up, but i think that would be a bad idea. i think i may be able to shim one side to angle the rods back to centerline. i'll give that a try next. that may be the way to go....

anyone else having this issue???"
potentially dangerous behaviour of taz 6,"summary: if a gcode file is truncated, taz will stop wherever it was, and keep the heaters on.

full story:
i created a gcode file using slic3r and used slic3r to save the file directly to an sd card.
i properly ejected the sd card using the software before removing it from the card reader. (note this is on linux mint 18.2).
i put the card into the taz and printed from sd.
the print started fine, and was still running fine 4 hours after i started it, and i went to bed. i woke up at 3:00 am and checked the print. i found the printhead stopped on the object with a small puddle of molten plastic under the tip. the % complete indicator was missing, but the print time was still incrementing. i was able to go into the menu, move the head off the print, extrude a bit more plastic to make sure the nozzle was not carbonized shut, then turn of the heaters.
i found later that the gcode file was about 600 k shorter than it should have been, and the end gcode was missing.

possible solutions:
1) the taz could scan the gcode before starting to verify that it ends with the print head temperature set to zero, and if not generate a warning message requiring the user to acknowledge the situation before continuing.
2) if the taz reaches the end of the file with the heaters still on, it could turn them off.

all good ideas, the one thing you need to remember is the processor in a rambo board is very limited compared to a computer. there isn't necessarily any processor overhead available to add cpu intensive pieces to without going with a newer style board.


i have seen arduino based md5 libraries out there. granted, i never actually looked into any of them, but i gotta think that they can operate on files on sd cards. fortunately, gcode files are pretty small so the processing wouldn't be too bad. i think the main concern would be if the additional memory resource requirements of a md5 generator library would cause the build to exceed the available memory resources of the device."
taz 5 extruder motor extremely hot!,our taz 5 extruder motor is getting extremely hot. our measured temperature on the motor after 1 hour into the print is 204°f  (96°c).  is this normal? it seems extremely high considering the small load on the extruder motor.  our prints also fail when the temperature gets this hot (starts sputtering and stops extruding). has anybody else run into this? is this normal?,"kmanley57 wrote: ?mon oct 09, 2017 1:56 pm
if you have a dvm measure the e0 ref and e1 ref test points near the driver chips(carefully). it should read around .6 -.8 volts. this is the voltage that is used to determine the drive currents for the motors. if it is off then the digipot is bad on the rambo.

that is what it sounds like is wrong.


so when the printer first starts up and is idle, the voltage reads about .75v.  however, as soon as you start a print it jumps up to 1.6v (even when the extruder motor is not running). it also stays at 1.6v after the print is cancelled. you have to power the printer off & restart to get back to the .75v. what do you think?"
taz 6 extruder swapping,"this may have been covered before. if so, please point me in the proper direction as i have not been able to find a satisfactory understanding.

i just got a dual extruder for my taz6 and reviewed the installation/setup process and it all seems pretty clear. my confusion is with swapping back to the single extruder. now, i have read cura takes care of the firmware reprogramming when you change the tool head in the machine settings. can any one confirm this?

what else needs to be done besides a selection change in cura? re-calibrations? re-configurations? i hear that some people like to just keep the dual installed, but i would like to stick to the single for jobs that don't need the dual. 

also, are the limitations with the dual extruder. i read about the auto leveling not being an options for some, but not others? is there a dual extruder workflow that should be followed?

it would be great if there was a well documented process to follow that covered all the nuances.

i myself like to place a sticker with the e steps for the single extruder so i have the needed number/s when i change back to the single from the dual. best to record before you change to the dual.


is that all you have to do besides choosing the single extruder in the cura machine settings? since the esteps are known from the factory, there is no need to do the extruder calibration? what about z height calibration?

if you do not lose your calibration sheet from the factory - no.

as for the z offset which i assume you're asking about. since the firmware re-flash probably overwrites the old value and as you have physically changed the extruder, and it might be at a different position now than before. it might be a good idea to check the offset on the first print.


ok, thanks for explaining that. i do still have the cal sheet and see the documented z offset and t0 esteps. i will check that it is correct with the esteps and z offset that is actually set in the fw first. then, i will install the dual. then, when i am ready to go back to the single, i will:
1) select the single tool in cura
2) let it re-flash the fw
3) reset the estep for t0 to what it is now
4) reset the z offset to what it is now

i assume that once i get through the dual's installation procedure and get ready to print, i will have new calibration numbers (for z offset) that i will want to save for whenever i reinstall the dual, correct? then its just a matter of making sure the proper fw is loaded and the proper esteps and z offset are set whenever i am swapping? thanks again for bearing with me on this. i just need to take the jump and try it already!"
odd sound on moving z-axis (damage ?),"hey i have this odd sound; almost like a rubbing sound when the z-axis moves up and down sometimes. i'm wondering if it grease displacement; maybe the bearings? you can hear it after 0:27 in the audio clip, it's a bit quite; i could get another clip if that helps. any help would be greatly appreciated!

"printer stops extruding, chomps filament","the printer stops extruding sometimes, i find a chomp out bit of filament everytime as well. usually the print will run and finish but only the first few layers will be printed.

any ideas to for the cause?

see picture below","heat creep is when the filament higher up in the extruder body starts to soften. in other words, heat creeps up the filament. this causes a problem because pressure from the filament being pushed into the extruder causes this softer filament to expand and bind in the print head. as it gets harder and hard to push the filament thru, the hobbed bolt cuts a ""mouse bite"" in the filament and your print is finished. different filaments conduct head differently and some will be much more prone to this than others. hot end design plays a big role too and some hot ends are better than others in regards to this. coupled with this are print speeds and hot end temperatures as printing too slow for a given temperature will allow heat to creep up. you end up having to find the right balance for a particular printer and filament and i find the hexagon hot end on the taz 5 and 6 to have a fairly narrow sweet spot though admittedly i have only worked with 3 different hot ends so maybe it's fairly normal?

the classic signs of heat creep are that (when starting from a cold printer) you can print small objects ok, but larger/longer prints will fail. this is because it takes a bit for the heat to ""creep"" up the filament and cause problems. if you are getting your mouse bite right away and barely anything is ending up on your bed, you have a clogged nozzle. if your print starts ok and fails, it is probably the creep.

fwiw, i struggled with printing pla with my taz 5. i had the creep bad. i replaced the useless hot end fan with a larger one and found a filament oiler on thingiverse that definitely helped. i can't find the same one right now, but it sat on the print head right where the filament enters and it had a small little bowl where you would put a bit of cotton ball and add a few drops of oil. i used olive oil which worked well. in the end, i swapped the hot end out for an e3d v6 and haven't looked back. it seems to have a wider sweet spot and i can print a number of filaments without a lot of fussing and tweaking. i love my taz printers, but their hot ends aren't the best."
z axis issue with new taz6,"hello,

if the two z leadscrews are off too far,leveling will not complete. you should have the same distance from the end of the lead screw nut to the closest identical frame point on either side.


this happened to me on with my printer out of the box. auto-level would not complete. i tried several times with no luck. raise you z axis as close to the top as you can without crashing the tool extruder into the frame. then, measure the distance from the z nut frames to the top of the printer frame as piercet suggested. make sure the printer is off and manually turn one of the sides so that it matches the other side. use a caliper if you have one. after i corrected mine, it runs like a champ every time."
problem with taz 6 print,"howdy,

i'm attempting a print on the taz 6 i just unboxed and it's not going quite as well as i'd hoped. i'm getting a bunch of angel hair protruding from the print, blobs of filament, and the print head looks like it dragged through the print in question. i'm using ngen filament and cura 21.08. i can't get a computer close enough to the printer to control it directly so i put my gcode on an sd card and started the print off that. at first i had an issue with the ""probe fail clean nozzle"" until i rotated the z-axis motor a full revolution counter clockwise and then that problem passed. 

i've attached pictures of the print, which did not complete the first level and the gcode i used. any help would be appreciated.

dirk","ok, making progress. i moved the z offset up to -1.35 from -1.5 (factory default). i also tested the extrusion to ensure that it was putting out the correct amount of filament per the calibration instructions here: https://ohai.lulzbot.com/project/fine-t ... libration/ (it was). the outline printed mostly ok, but when the print head lifted and started printing the actual pieces, it looks like the filament wasn't adhering to the print bed.

taz 5 flexystruder v1 printable parts,"i have a taz 4 that i recently upgraded to a taz 5.  works great.  my reason for posting is my previous hot end would print ninjaflex without much difficulty but this new hot-end binds up the filament.  i understand all that so i thought i would take my older head and make a flexystruder head out of it.  problem:  can't find the files anywhere to modify it.  it would be a flexystruder v1 and all i can find are some parts for the v2 and a body for the v1.  are there any other parts?  all the links to the parts i have found in the forums have come back as non existent and what i have found is just different versions of the body that the filament goes in to.  is this the only part?  so...

taz 4 for sale uk,"hi all,

due to a house move and growing family my taz 4 is unfortunately now not getting the use it deserves given my significant investment in it,  and as such i'm now considering selling it. 

the printer has been great, i've printed and fitted the pla fan shroud upgrade and also swapped out the y-axis rods and igus bearings with hardened rods and linear ball bearings which made a huge difference. i have the hardened rods and bearings to do the x-axis too but never got round to it so would include these too. 

also have 7 full or near-full rolls of various filaments including pla, abs, n-vent, and hips - plus about 2/3 of a roll of red pla currently on the printer, a coil of the esun cleaning filament, original user manual and a tube of the spare pet sheets from lulzbot. the printer has had very little use due mainly to my time constraints and has been sat in my house unplugged for the last 6 months - but on the occasions i have been able to use it it prints very well and has been totally reliable.

just floating this here in order to gauge any interest really, ideally i'd like to get £800-£1000 for the lot so if anyone is interested or wants more information please do get in touch. i live in warwick in the midlands, and given the size/weight/fragility of the printer and the fact that i no longer have the box the buyer would need to collect it as i don't want to take the risk of shipping!

prints out of scale,"hi,

i'm going around and around with customer support on this and their suggestions don't make sense to me.

i'm 2 weeks into 3d printing.  bought a taz6.  everything i print so far is squished on the z-axis.  i have tried the following filaments:

taulman 645 nylon
verbatim pla
ic3d pla
the sample of filament that came with the taz6.

ok, so i got kinda fed up and decided to just go simple and print a 20mm calibration cube.  dimensions measure out 20.27 x, 20.32 y, and 19.32 z in the verbatim using the standard quick print profile.

the taulman 645 measures 20.28 x, 20.33 y, and 19.20 z

results are very repeatable.

customer support is currently recommending that i scale the z axis in cura.  yes, this will work, but it seems asinine to me that i have to manually tweak each and every print if the z axis repeatably prints flat.

i'm grateful for any help provided.  i really can't get on with printing until i get to the bottom of this.

cheers,
trick420","greetings,

check out this article: https://reprage.com/post/46062359808/qu ... 3d-printer
instead of doing updates on the firmware as it's noted in the guide, simply adjust the values through printers menu: config-> adv settings-> scroll to the very bottom and there should be input value for each axis step per mm. keep in mind that his is not the best approach to solve this as you override factory settings of stepper motors. however, this is the easiest step to calibrate the dimensional accuracy.

usually out of all axis z (your height) prints out very precise.. so for your 20mm print cube, you should've had 20mm at z and slight offset(+-.2mm) on x y.

kindly take a picture of you device (main point of interest is z axis assembly for each side) take as many picture possible starting from bottom motor going up to cylindrical coupler that connects motor with threaded rods (drive rods). i suspect there is some misalignment there.. once z is fixed the rest of axis could be adjusted by tensioning the belts on either axis.

cheers!"
extruder fans not working and it's causing the motor to make a knocking sound from lack of cooling.,"i've had the taz for just over a week now. i've tried a variety of settings with cura with no issues prior to this. the fans won't turn on regardless of what settings in the machine or cura i try. the motor starts making a knocking noise, and it also causes some y axis banding. i've tried several things like different gcodes, restoring settings, and even just not having it on for awhile (this is torture btw.)

here's a dropbox link to watch it in action, or lack of rather. any help would be greatly appreciated - happy to answer any questions or provide more pictures.","the knocking sound is probably filament grinding due to an idler arm tension screw needing to be tightened. you want 8mm or less between the washers on either side of the springs. the barrel cooling fan, which should always be on, appears to be operational. the part cooling fans are either not enabled, set to too low a percentage to actually turn on (10% or 0%) or aren't connected electrically. it's more likely you have a setting incorrect. but if you just got your taz you are under warranty and can call support."
first layer issues?,"at least i think that's the problem. i've had my taz 6 and have been printing happily for months now, but recently i've been having my first print failures, i had narrowed it down to some prints not sticking to the bed and it was when i started printing these calibration cubes that i saw this issue.






so i started watching the first layer like a hawk and noticed some strangeness and stopped the print several times with this result






now, i'm still new at this, learning as i go, but i thought this was maybe overextrusion? so i performed the extruder calibration instructions here: https://ohai.lulzbot.com/project/extrud ... libration/

it was only off by a few millimeters, so i edited it as instructed. still no joy. so i thought to myself, maybe i've changed something, let me go back and factory reset it, and print my first rocktupus again using the included file and the ngen they provided. after all, my first print was pretty nice, especially it's first layer as you can see here:






except for the fact that i broke a leg getting it off the plate  (it was my first time!)

but, printing another rocktupus ended up like this:






yes, i broke two arms off of this one....i was frustrated...anyway.

if you haven't changed your zoffset but prints are starting to not stick, i'd try a couple of things below.

clean bed thoroughly, with alcohol and lint free cloth. try a reprint.

use a brim. try a reprint

you could continue to lower your zoffset. be prepared to adjust:
initial layer thickness
initial layer line width
1st layer speed
try a reprint.

lulzbot taz6 z-axis binding,"frame is perfectly square.  right side lead screw is very easy to turn. left side binds and is hard to turn.  removed lead screw nut and it becomes free (both sides move with same force)  once i put lead screw nut back on it seems to feel ok but once it moves a little bit it bins up again.  removed the lead screw and this is what i see.  it appears the lead screw is off center and when the nut is put on it pulls it even more and binds.  was thinking about filing the cone some to open the hole?  also loosened the x-axis on that side to see if that would release some tension and allow it to move back to center but didnt work.

see how the left side is closer to the z motor mount than the right side? you need to manually turn the left side lead screw until it is the same height as the right side one, then recalibrate.


that has been done several times.  that is a picture of what it looks like when it tried to do the test print.


in that case its either a motor coupler that is missing setscrews and has come loose, failed bearings, debris inside the leadscrew nut,  a bad x end allignment, or a failing motor / electrical.


nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, and nope.

i have the top plate off that holds the lead screw in place, the bearing removed, the belt removed, the left side cone is loosend from the two y-axis rods. the lead screw nut off of the lead screw and it spins with no resistance.  as soon as you begin tightening the nut the lead screw begins to become harder and harder to turn until it is impossible to turn by hand.  as seen in the photo above it is as if the as the nut is being tightened the lead screw is being pulled tighter into the cone."
12v 40mm cooling fan replacing the original 24v,"hello, i'm just curious how are other taz 5/6 owners powering their aftermarket 12v 40mm part cooling fan in place of the original 24v.

as multiple posts suggests, most non-original 24v fans have issue with rambo's pwm at low rpm, some have suggested using 12v fan instead as there are many more choices. i came across this post regarding dropping the rambo's 24v output to 12v using zener diodes so i ordered a few 12v and 6v diodes to experiment.

the good news is that 12v fans work exactly as expected, but what i am concerned about is the incredible amount of heat the one 12v diode was generating, by simply touching hot end thermistor to the diode it was reading over 70c! not sure how i would have to keep this thing from melting nearby wires.

curious how are fellow taz owners getting 12vs to run properly with taz's pwm and not use an external power source, or if anyone has any suggestions on well priced 24v fans that are easily accessible.

are you using the 3 watt diodes that was linked to in the other forum topic? and he used 2 - 3 watt 6 volt diodes which gave him 6 watts of power dissipation.

taz 6: rubbing sound at bottom of z-axis?,"hi all,

my taz 6 has started eliciting a ""rubbing"" sound during the auto-leveling sequence when the extruder reaches the bottom of the z-axis -- the sound isn't like the grinding i've seen in other posts, you can see/hear what i'm talking about in this video: https://www.dropbox.com/s/dhh7ocs1qdm1z ... d.mov?dl=0

the sound only occurs when the z-axis is moving downwards towards the bed, and only at the _very_ bottom of the z-axis. everything seems ok after auto-leveling completes, but that's probably because the z-axis only moves upwards during prints...

has anyone else encountered anything similar? any suggestions?

thanks!","sounds like your x axis is out of alligntment and binding slightly. using calipers. measure from the top of the lower leadscrew bearing up to the bottom of the x axis ends on both sides. if one side is up higher than the other, manually turn the leadscrew slowly with the printer off until it measures the same ."

for the average hand to come in from the sides and grasp the frame to move it in and out of our enclosure, we should offset the bounding box by 70mm on the right side and 25mm on the electronics side. so now our width is 685mm. first assumption is that this leaves enough room to insert and remove the sd card in the lcd screen in the upper left front corner of the taz frame, not shown in picture. at this point you might be wondering where the filament spool is for these measurements, and i decided it is more important to reduce the printer’s footprint. most of us have space to stack and build upward. let’s offset the front and back by 30mm on each side, our new depth becomes 568, and even that might be too excessive.
i had the same idea as user:benfarmer to have the filament spool outside and have it feed through a slot cut in the top of our enclosure. but then, to make less manufacturing processes, why cut a slot in the top for the filament to feed through? why not have the filament sit above the taz completely inside the enclosure and attach to the frame of the taz? the frame will have no problem with the load. i just don’t know how high it needs to be for the filament to move freely when the x-axis moves side to side. you can position the spool front to back so that the filament comes off the spool tangent to where it enters the extruder. you could print the supports that hold the spool and if you double extrude, just have a longer axis for the two spools to pivot on.



yes, that is lulzbot green taz_02.jpg (17.2 kib) viewed 6828 times


i think another benefit to having the filament in the enclosure is that it will be a consistent temperature each time you use it and reduce moisture content. if you print in your garage in the winter the filament could be at a very chilly room temp or if you summer in arizona, your garage temp could be a few degrees from already melting the filament on the spool.    also, since heat rises, your filament sits up in the hottest part of the enclosure and your electronics sit down in the coolest part. ideally i would like to move the electronics out of the enclosure, but for now let’s assume they will stay inside. one thing i don’t know is if it makes a lick of difference whether the filament is pre-temped or not once it hits the heating element of the extruder. experiment needed.

next: moving the heat around. i don’t know how hot these enclosures will get naturally. perhaps some of you that have one can lend some data. i also don’t know what the point is to have all your heat collect in the top of the enclosure when you really need it down around the part. or do you want it down around your part? will a warm draft cause parts to separate? will a hot draft cause the same to happen? at what temp does the ambient moving air inside the enclosure need to be to provide the benefits of something like a sous-vide machine. which gives us the most benefit: creating a draft-free oven like environment, or a drafty convection oven, or draft-free radiant heat from a few halogen bulbs pointed at the printer bed? i don’t have a printer, so i have no idea which we should shoot for. in the back of my head is the idea of having possibly two computer fans attached to the inner corners of the enclosures to circulate air, if all of this would actually create a benefit. what about too much heat? what are the operating temperatures for the stepper motors and the electronics? i don't know, but i think it could be an easy fix because you can get a thermostat switch for $10 (ex: circuit on at 120°f and off at 105°f or what ever temperature range you want) for an exhaust fan to remove heat if it gets too high for the components, and why not have another to turn on the halogen lights (ex: circuit on at 85°f and off at 100°f). and while you are exhausting air, get a thin duct to attach to the enclosure so you can exhaust the air out your bedroom window in case you print in the house, no abs fumes. a problem with lights turning on and off for heat is that if you have a webcam recording, this can mess up your exposure. i would probably use some 35w heating rods. because the electronics sit low and close to the side of the enclosure, why not have a duct that directs exterior air to and from the electronics enclosure and the fan inside the electronics enclosure does the circulation. think indoor gas fireplace, you have to bring air in from outside and vent it back outside. plus, that is what i think i am seeing in user:benfarmer's pictures.

lastly are enclosure forms and materials. i like user:1013’s simple cardboard enclosure.  but if i want to have a webcam filming the printing so i can playback later and figure out where things went wrong, then i need light. if i want the process to be visible and not have to open and close the cardboard enclosure to see, i think the material needs to be transparent or have transparent windows. if i do window openings like user:benfarmer, how much extra labor does it add to cut out the windows and cut glass and wood. granted if the wood is free materials sitting around, that is a different story. i like the idea of a plexiglas enclosure, no windows to cut for viewing. one material could create the entire enclosure. downside, scratches and dirt make it harder to see through and clean plastic enclosures, glass would be better for visibility but not for durability. also, does the enclosure even need a base? or can we just create an enclosure lid we set over the entire printer? similar to something you set over a cake or pie. three 3’ x 6’ sheets of plexiglas, 3mm in thickness, might run you $150 total and could each be cut in half and attached with printed corner braces and create the 6 or 5 sided enclosure we need. how about a door though to get in and remove your print? how about no door? connect two neighbor sides and the ceiling as the removable section of the enclosure; the other two neighboring sides and the floor are stationary. now you have access to the electronics without pulling the machine in and out (to replace blown fuses) and access to the front of the printbed. more access area then if you had one door on one side. see picture for example. the image is to scale, so you see a 3’ x 6’ sheet of plexiglas cut in half is still way too big, and i said i want to keep my foot print as small as possible. so i still need to find different size sheets that would create a small footprint with the least number of cuts needed. oh, and we'll need handles to lift the enclosure on and off. oh, and not sure a 3mm piece of plexiglas is strong enough to lift the entire printer and enclosure. oh, and we'll need access holes to bring the power cable in from the power supply and a usb cord.









i think it will be great when i finally get the printer and i am too busy tinkering with it to sit and write these long posts. i like to write out the thought process though so others can see what i’m considering and maybe catch things i’m not even aware of. hope it sparks some ideas though, and hopefully others can improve on my ideas. i’ll definitely post my enclosure when it is all said and done."
y-axis doing rugged sounds and not moving properly,"hi,

i just bought a new taz6 (it's my second taz6). i just installed it and began with the start up. it was printing the rocktopus properly, but by about of 60% of good printing, y-axis began making rugged noises and not moving properly.

i checked conections and cables, seems to be ok. i tried sending it back home, but it still has issues. i don't find more information about this problem.

any idea of what could be happening?

i just changed the motor for a different one of x-axis. it happened exactly the same, like if i didn't do changes; so it is not the motor.

taz 5 hotends not heating up all the way,"so about 3 months ago i upgraded my stock hotend to a new flexydually hotend and i have had great results. this last week all of the sudden, my temps on the hotends seem to stay about 15 degrees under the projected temperatures. these are the things i've troubleshooted so far,

1. check the resistance of the heat capacitors, the check out at around 20 ohms.

2. check the resistance of the thermistor, they check out at around 100k ohms.

3. set my temperatures to the presets physically on the machine to abs/ninja - 230 - 220, resulting temperatures were 213ish and 206ish

4. same as 3 but on the computer using cura, once again the temperatures are about 15 degrees lower.

5. had a thought to turn the base temperatures up to 256 and 246. results were 240ish and 229ish (about 15 degrees lower)

6. thought redoing the firmware might solve the trick, i had no success. still 15 degrees under the set temperature.

i still dont know if its the rambo or something software/firmware. 









","i would try the old single extruder if you still have it, and flash back to that setup, heat the single extruder up and see if it works/heats correctly. if so then you are probably looking at bad thermistors then that have failed.

so my first thought to this was, i don't need to change it out. but i did like the idea of changing the firmware to a different nozzle type. and these are the results.

set the machine back to original single print head 






temperature went up to the set temperature. instantly i knew it wasn't my rambo or cura (in general) but something about the firmware. so my next thought was to see if magically it fixed the flexydually firmware. reflashed it and these are the results




 

only the first nozzle is set, and the temperature is about 15 degrees under the set temp. so i thought, lets try the other hotend options and see what happens. here are the results from firmware flashed to the v2 dual extruder.




 

first nozzle came right up to temperature! at this point i knew it was a setting within the machine, but i didn't know what menu it was in until i found them in the custom temperature choice from the machine. as you can see, the p's i's and d's are set to....






zero!?!? so after that i tried to following,

uninstall software and delete files and reset all of the software
pick my machine with the flexydually print head
check the pid.... still zero

next i just took the pid settings from the v2 dual extruder and manually set them for now, but my question is this...

why does the flexydually revert to 0?"
"sd card plastic broke off inside card reader, taz6","must be the unlucky one. had my taz 6 since april, its been a learning experience. i'm happy with it. 

sd card has become my preferred way to print. learned the hard way not to have a computer attached by usb while printing. if the computer reboots it will initialize the usb port and the taz will freeze its print. so since april i must have inserted the sd card dozens of times into the taz6. anyway somehow a piece of the sd card broke off inside the taz6. i didnt realize this. so the next time i reinserted the sd card, the broken part of the card must have pushed farther into the sd reader and damaged the pins that read data. contacted lulzbot support and this is not covered.

so using a computer is not ideal, because it could reboot and goto sleep over long prints. octopi is an option, but sometimes my pi3 stutters or hangs which causes blobs or other problems with the print. so as the taz6 is currently designed the sd card method is the safest way to print. but by design one has to take the sd card in and out hundreds of times during the life a 3d printer. i've only had it 4 months. 

i realize i caused this problem. just wish the printer had some internal memory and a wireless interface for $2500. be careful with your sd cards.","thanks i will definitely try a cheap sd card extender or the sd wifi card you suggest, once the replacement board comes. that way i can greatly reduce the times i'm changing sd cards. or revisit the octopi, and hope it doesn't lag and cause print problems (even pi3 stuttered)

my point is for $2500, why do i have to even buy some other product to avoid this issue. i used the taz 6 as designed. sd cards are so yester year, even cars and refrigerators have wifi now.

tough luck i guess. i'm just venting and trying to alert others to avoid the same issue."
taz6 no power,"so, my nearly 100% trouble-free taz6 just quit on me. perhaps 20 minutes into a 2 hour print it died and will not power on. i've checked power at outlet and surge protector, all normal. where do i start? replace fuses? i popped open the enclosure, nothing on fire... nothing looks amiss... any suggestions? pretty sure i'm out of warranty.",i would look and see if when you flip the power switch does any led's turn on on the control board and the rear fan turn on. there are two fuses in a panel just under the power cord plug. but if you see the switch light up when you flip it then those are fine. the switch needs both of those working to light up the neon element inside it. if your logic fuse blew nothing would light up since the control board will not run to turn anything on. aka - no lcd lights/characters. the other two fuses on the board are the bed heater and fans/motors. so those two the lcd would still light up but nothing would move or heat up.
first time use: clam knife fail,"so... just got a lulzbot taz 6 and used the included clam knife to pry off the print. ended up putting a deep scratch in the surface on the first print.



looks like the general suggestion is to ""put the clam knife in the drawer"" and use something else.

anyway - what should i do? sand it out? replace the pei?","jim2386 wrote:looks minimal. leave it. if you didn't cut through the pei, just keep on printing.

taz 6 auto level issue (help),"i have a taz 6 that is about a month old. it was been operating flawlessly thus far. now today i am having an auto leveling issue. 

it will home properly, goes through the initial wipe procedure just fine, it levels the first two bed corners without a problem but now without any noticiable issues it fails every single time it gets to the back right corner. it will try to rewipe and then goes through the procedure again and fails at the same corner. i've cleaned the nozzle, i've replaced the wiping strip, i've moved the corner washers to different locations. it fails to level every time in the same corner. i'm stumped. 

now just to give additional details, i have been considering making the purchase of a flexystruder, so today i was playing around with cura and created a new machine profile and selected taz 6 with a flexystruder head. it went through the process and installed the firmware. i removed that machine profile and went back to my original taz 6 profile and selected to install default firmware. does this have anything to do with the leveling issue?","i had same problem at the front spool side shortly after installing a dual head and assumed it was the print head. so went back to original single head and it did the same thing but returned to the wiper on a back spool side corner. 
turned out the z axis rails were not entirely perpendicular to the bed and by manually adjusting the spool side about half a turn i managed to get the contact again and the auto levelling works. i think the spool side was slightly lower and this prevented electrical contact.
when the current print stops i plan to calibrate the z height each side. does anyone have any pointers?"
black nozzle,"got a taz 6 2 weeks ago and have printed almost every day with 4-7 hour print jobs.  mostly ngen prints.  works great so far but i am getting black goo around the nozzle area.   it sometimes comes off in the prints as well and i suspect it is from the elmer's glue stick adhesion.

been 3d printing for years and normally use hairspray on a glass bed for pla adhesion (and it has worked great all these years for me).  all my other 3d printers have clean nozzles  (makerbot 2 old gen, robo3d, 3 printer bots) and they have all been workhorses.  

so i suspect it is the glue and i am just putting it on a bit too thick (i didn't think i did but i've never used it before so...).   i can fix that but i am wondering if that is what it is and perhaps the best way to clean it off.  it doesn't look like it will come off with a simple towel.

thanks.","it isn't unusual that the taz nozzle will get coated with carbon from excess filament over time. you can either clean the nozzle more frequently, or dial your extrusion back a bit to compensate. it's the shape of the nozzle mainly."
using the taz6 without auto leveling?,"i have a taz 5 at home, and recently purchased a taz 6 for work. i've had great luck with my 5 and assumed the 6 would be that great and better with the fancy bed leveling but like many others i find i get inconsistent first layers. sometimes the nozzle is smashed on the bed, sometimes it is say .75mm above the bed, and sometimes it is just right. i don't have time to baby the printer every time i send it a print and i am more than happy with the performance of my 5. i leveled it like, a year ago(?), and it cranks out parts like a champ.

is there some way to simply level the 6 manually and run it like i run my 5?","i was thinking more of a software modification. i am assuming that the auto leveling process generates parameters that define the virtual bed plane? couldn't these values be captured and, if an appropriate g code existed, sent to the printer before printing? i could see a couple of different printer profiles. one that would contain the g code for auto leveling, and one that would use pre-entered values. you could then polish up your nozzle and get a solid level, copy the parameters into your other profile, and use that until you feel you need to re-level the bed. in my experience with my 5, you could go quite some time.

i mean, is it just me and a few others who have posted that are having these problems? are the vast majority of users just hitting print over and over and getting fabulous prints every time? if so i'm feeling pretty bad about myself right about now. or are taz 6/mini users just used to babysitting that first layer? cancelling the print if something isn't right, cleaning the bed, scrubbing the nozzle and trying again. who has time for that?

regardless, in order to better educate myself, what role does the z button switch play in this? i know sometimes there will be a bit o plastic that oozes out that i can't wipe before it hits the button. it then wipes the nozzle and touches the corners. does it use that switch like my 5 does as a sort of z stop and then ""dials it in"" touching the corners? in that case maybe that bit o plastic matters?"
"abs / hips melting on large print, suggested settings?",on large prints my parts start to melt and sag when using abs with hips support. i'm running a taz 6 with abs and hips at 240c and 110c bed. using s3d. the first few hours look great but after it gets enough insulation that the heat build and the part starts to sag/warp/melt. the hips turns brown. i don't have an enclosure yet ( should be here at week's end) but i'm printing with a ooze shield which provides a similar effect.  i want to drop the bed temp after a couple layers but i don't want the abs to warp and delaminate.  does anyone have a proven solution?,"i have done 24h prints with hips at 240 in an enclosure and it has never perceptibly changed color. if the plastic has time to change color during the time it passes through the nozzle, i'd suspect your nozzle is too hot. also, my hips prints require substantial fan (~50%) to not sag and look melty. (i don't do abs so no idea there.)"
nozzle replacement for taz 2,"i recently picked up a taz 2 which came with a 0.5mm nozzle.  i would like to go smaller (0.2mm) to do fine prints but as i'm very new to all of this, i was curious where i could buy one and if i needed to get any specific sort of nozzle?  the store here doesn't seem to sell nozzles for the taz 2 that i can find.

thank you!","the taz 2 used the old buddaschnozzle 2.0c nozzle.  finding nozzles for them are nearly impossible anymore. itworks3d.com may possibly have some. 

that being said, swapping a nozzle on those old style hotends is more likely than not going to strip the threads.  you may need to upgrade if that occurs."
taz5 stops printing after a few hours,"i have a taz5 and usually print from the sd card.  recently, the printer will just stop printing after a few hours, even if the print is not complete.  what will happen is that the printer will suddenly stop moving, but the hot end and hot plate will still continue to create heat.  i tried waiting for an hour but nothing resumes.  i even tried pausing and restarting the print, but that does nothing.  this is not a one time event.  it has happened 3 times in a row.  is there something wrong with the electronics?  am i doing something wrong?","i apologize for the necroposting but this thread correlates strongly with my issue that i am having with my taz3.

i have been running my  taz 3 regularly for the past few years (original owner). i have burned through several kilos of pla and never had this problem before.

taz3 freezes up after an hour or two and will not respond. also the screen displays the nozzle and bed temps at the time of the freeze. i have to hard boot (power off) the machine for it to respond to any new commands. 

at first i thought that it was the communication to astrobox. i have uploaded the file from simplify 3d and then sent the file to print from astrobox while it was still ""converting"" the file. this is only a problem on large (>5m files). but i now don't think that's the problem. i latest file that i tried to print was given sufficient time to completely upload and translate into astrobox before printing the file.

has anyone had any luck diagnosing the issue? i don't want to call lulzbot if the knowledge base here has an answer.

networking a taz 6: explain it like i'm five,"i work for a public library and we're planning on premiering our new taz 6 soon. my question is, does anyone know if it's possible to network a taz 6 using an ethernet to usb adapter? i'd love to be able to run 3d prints through cura from my office computer to the public location where we're planning on displaying the taz 6, but i'm not sure it's possible to network the printer via an ethernet port.

any thoughts? is this even possible?","the easiest method is using a $35 device called a raspberry pi https://www.adafruit.com/product/3055?g ... cmqavd_bwe and a free software called octoprint http://octoprint.org you can bolt it directly to the side of a taz 6 https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1663146 

you basically download the octopi linux image to the raspberry pi sd card, plug a network cable into the pi, plug the printer into the pi usb port and follow the instructions http://octoprint.org/download/ to bring it up. if you can install windows on a computer, you can install octopi.

if you do it right, you then have a website that you can link to from your office computer to start prints. you can add a $35 camera to the pi and even watch it print from your desk. 

the one downside to it is you either have a network interface or a usb interface, not both. so your control computer with the taz would also need to use that web interface.  you can password protect that interface if you like. 

there are other options that do the same thing, like astroprint but they a. cost, and b. aren't great. 

you can get pre loaded card kits for around $65 http://www.ebay.com/itm/2016-octoprint- ... 9v_0dcwb6q"
"taz6 flezystruder problem with ""auto home""","i recently got a taz6, and am having issues homing all axes with the flexystruder attached. with the stock extruder attached, i was able to perform one of the test prints that came preloaded, and on the lcd menu selecting ""movements"" --> ""auto home"", the homing sequence goes through the steps of touching off on the manual switches, first on the x-axis, then y-axis, then z-axis. during the sequence, after the y-axis touch-off occurs, it shifts the bed towards the back slightly so the nozzle is hovering over the z-axis manual switch (round button), which should be the appropriate home position for x/y before the z-axis touches off. 

i also bought a taz compatible flexystruder, and after installation, which is as simple as tightening one fastener and plugging the connector in, i attempted to perform the same ""auto home"" feature. this time, it touches off x, touches off y, but it doesn't shift the bed back at all before homing z, so the nozzle isn't hovering over the manual z switch when attempting to touch off. i can't find anything relating to home position in any of the settings on the lcd menu. does anyone know how to fix this problem?","so glad i found this thread! i am having a very similar problem. even the steps i followed were the same.

i even switched everything back to default (extruder head, firmware, filament) and still have the ""home"" sequence problem. i actually have been turning the machine off before it pushes too far down the z axis and damages the bed. then i have to manually move it up. see attached pics.

it seems that installing the flexystruder and flashing the firmware has thrown off its ""center"". and after trying to go back to factory settings still hasn't worked.

any help is greatly appreciated.

i have shut down and restarted cura, and also the printer itself with no change.

can anyone help with other things i can check to try and work out whats wrong?

the bed should have continuity all the way back to the rambo board on the heat wires, check at that plug for continuity. 
if the bed checks out, the fuse is fine and the thermistor is fine, it could be the board, but that's a rare failure. the control box plug, wire harness and the thermistor are the most common failure points. and the fuse i suppose.

wireless (wi-fi) sd cards,"i just ordered a taz6. one thing that i wanted to do was utilize the headless feature of the printer and execute prints without a pc running and tethered via usb.

i looked at the raspberry pi option, which seemed nice and i may still peruse (my raspberry pi 3 has built in wifi!!), but also discovered a neat workaround that makes my goals so much simpler. wi-fi sd card! toshiba makes a 16gb unit that can be had for $35 on amazon, which also allows for network mapping allowing a user to send gcode files directly to the card. i figured that i could load up cura, define a print, send the resulting gcode to the wi-fi sd card, and go over to the printer and execute it.

has anyone had any experience with these devices with the taz printers?

i was also wondering if there any advantage/disadvantage to running the internal gcode interpreter firmware in the taz (is this merlin?), vs running something like octopi from a raspberry pi?

thanks!","piercet wrote:it is possible. here is a general configuration guide for marlin printers. http://microfabricator.com/blogs/view/i ... 3d-printer

you simply copy gcode files to the drive. no need for a cgi web interface or third party software. just windows explorer, which is nice.

you mentioned a configuration for marlin printers, but i didnt see any special steps needed in the writeup that pertained to marlin. my only concern was uploading new files to the sd card and the printer not seeing them without a card ejection, reboot, or something. or if there was a limitation in the taz firmware where this type of device did not work as expected that people were aware of.

considering purchasing a taz 5 from a friend,"hey guys,

a buddy of mine is thinking about selling his taz 5 for a decent deal (almost for the price of a mini!).  i own a mini and know the few issues that particular machine can have, and i was wondering if anyone with a taz 5 could chime in on things i should be looking at before i buy the printer.  
any weak points or issues i should be looking for?
any sort of maintenance that i should ask about?
any upgrades that are popular for that machine?

thanks guys!","the taz 5 is a solid machine. its basically a 6 without auto leveling and with 10mm x rods instead of 12. a taz 5 is essentially a big mini with an lcd and no leveling. wobble can be a potential issue given the longer spans, but that can be dealt with. weak spots are the same as a mini, the idler, the small gear on the extruder, pei lifting, the usual. nothing major. there are a few of the earliest 5s that have the 4 style power supply (rounded black plastic cover) that tend to fail a bit early compared to the others. the small squirrel cage fan on the extruder is also prone to early failure, they use a different style on the 6 now. 

maintenance, basically make sure they didn't oil or grease the bearing rods, if they did you can work around that. 

the openbuilds x and y axis and the anti wobble are popular modifications. the z axis and micrometer barrel retrofits too. retrofitting to a 6 is another popular path. itworks3d.com often carries the necessary parts.  there are also reinforced carriages, fitting the 6 style extruder to a 5, etc."
how much bearing play is normal?,"both x-axis bearings on my taz6 have about 0.30-0.35 mm play. translating that down to the nozzle, it easily ends up being a millimeter, which is significant when the nozzle is half of that... you can easily see vibration traces in the prints when the print head makes a sharp acceleration. is this really normal, or do i have a set of extra-sloppy bearings? it seems excessive given that it's a $2.5k printer, not a $500 one...","lutorm wrote:yeah, the play is between the rod and the bearing, not between the bearing and the mount.
yes. but if you move the bearing to one side or the other of the rod inside said bearing mount, then you are theoretically in contact with the bearing and the rod with no gap at that point of contact (and a bigger gap on the side not in contact with the rod)

those particular igus bearings are designed for preload press fit applications. in the holder like they are without that preload, that's your contact pattern. you options are to move the bearings to get some better contact, wrap tape around it to force better contact,  swap them out for different bearings such as the oilite bronze ones that some people are using, or find and or machine a bearing housing out of aluminum that allows preload and retrofit. or go openbuilds."
bridge nylon lifting pei sheet,"over the past couple of weeks i've printed a ton of little parts with taulman's bridge nylon, and they appear to be lifting the pei sheet on my taz6 like crazy, like every place where i've printed now has a little air bubble, ring, or whatnot. is this normal? it does not seem to matter if i use a lot of glue stick, or just a wipe of pva-glue laced water, and the parts come off pretty easily in either case. i'm printing with the cura defaults, 250c / 90c.","i had the same problem, luckily i had another issue that i needed to send my printer in for service and they also swapped out my bed.  my issue was several small parts fairly close together caused the pei to pull up between them.  this didn't happen until the bed cooled down post-printing, so next time i print in nylon i'm going to change my ending gcode so the bed doesn't cool down much at all and make sure there is more space between if i'm doing lots of smaller pieces."
get the static of my chest,"here is the story from the beginning. 

a student slides the sd card into the lcd screen/sd card slot, she said a spark of static leaped from her finger into the slot. then the lcd screen becomes unreadable. we order a new lcd screen and install it but had the same result, an unreadable lcd. support at lulzbot then suggested we purchase and install a new motherboard. we ordered one and installed it carefully and on a static mat. now the lcd screen works perfectly but the thermistors in both of my heads blew out. we are getting read outs of 200 c at the hot end from the machine but our thermometer says 115 c. so right now i have a very complex and expensive paperweight. 

we are out of warranty and the techs don't have any answers.

has anybody dealt with any of this? 

also, after our last firmware update we couldn't set the temperature from the computer anymore. we have to set it on the machine. did we do something to cause this or is this the new functionality of the software?","for an educational institution, lulzbot sells extended warranties and you might want to go that route https://www.lulzbot.com/store/parts/lul ... d-warranty 

that being said, first off, did anyone replace the two small rice grain sized fuses on the old board before you pulled it? it might not actually be dead. and second, it is possible the thermistors blew, but not from a static discharge. something else happened if it melted them. thermistors are cheap though. a new hexigon thermistor is $8, a heater cartridge is $6. https://itworks3d.com/product-category/ ... z-6-parts/ a bed assembly is going to be around $80. chances are the wire harness is intact, but it is possible you have the thermistor leads swapped so heating extruder 1 never registers an increase because it is wired to extruder 2's thermistor, etc. 

you should always be able to set the temperature from an attached computer, if you can't, there may be something in the gcode overriding it."
foil tape between bed heater and glass,has anyone ever looked into putting some cooper or aluminum tape between the bed heater and the glass to try and even out the hot and cold spots?  i did a search on the forums but nothing like this hit.  maybe the 6 has a more even distribution of heat but i remember seeing thermal images of the 5's bed and it is kind of wonky (http://www.sd3d.com/not-all-heated-beds ... ted-equal/).,"yes, but not for that reason. i was trying to improve conductivity for an automatic bed leveling sensor. i eventually abandoned that approach in favor of just going wiht a 3/16"" thick aluminum bed plate in place of the glass, which works much better since glass is an insulator. ironically i never really implemented leveling because i got tired of waiting for it to finish it's grid. 

with foil tape, you run into adhesion issues. the tape adheres well to the glass, but the heater pad or the pei adhesive doesn't adhere great to it and tends to lift away more readily than adhesive on glass with pei alone."
"flexydually v2, help printing with flexy only","i want to be able to print sometimes with a single flexible filament only on the flexy head. i dont see even basic support in cura 21.04 to accomplish this goal. a search thru the forums reveals this is a comman request of flexydually owners. my point is it's not easy to print with just the flexy. it's sold to advanced users, i get it. but shouldn't printing single filaments on the flexydually be part of the lulzbot edition of cura? it's not even in the new beta 2.4. 

so i have searched the lulzbot forums and this post from 2015 helped. but i'm not sure the instructions provided were intended for the taz 6. also read some other post's that said use a single extruder profile for the material you want to print with. so i loaded a single extruder profile but that's only half the battle. you need custom gcode to handle a few things thats not in the single profiles start gcode. 

this is the start gcode i hacked together. need some help fixing it, or some other suggestions to achieve goal above.

m117 taz printing...            ; lcd status message


it solves a few problems:
moves the wipe position up 2mm's like the dual extruder's start gcode so the flexydually hotend doesnt hit the wipe pad mount during wiping.
heat's up back extruder (t0) before wipe procedure so that filament can be cleaned off during the wiping, allowing a good bed calibration.
after bed autoleveling with t0, turn t0 off so any rigid filament doesn't cook.
then move the print head forward 50mm in y axis and redefine that as your new y=0 position
code: select allg1 y50                       ; move y to new offset position
g92 y0                      ; set new y offset
t1                           ; activate e1

then sets t1 as primary extruder


that basically gets me to where i need to be, printing with just the front flexy extruder. i was able to print the needed gasket alone in ninaflex.

positioned horizontally in cura:





comes out like this:





already removed 3mm brim in photo but it printed ok, model centered along x however not along y (ok in this case, but not for a bigger model)

positioned vertically in cura:





comes out like this:

please help.","a lot of people ask for this... its seems difficult to only print with t1 in some slicers.  in s3d you can specify the front or back extruder only.

the key is specifying t1 before the start of your gcode.

maybe mechanically switching the extruders (flexy to t0 position, and normal to t1 position) could help this also... but would depend on the frequency you plan to print flexy only.

could also replace your normal extruder with an extruder body that works with flexible filament... then you could print hard or flexible with t0."
taz 5 heated build plate connector very hot and smells like magic smoke,"currently the hbp on my taz 5 is still working, however the connector and wiring leading to the y axis has began getting almost too hot to touch when in use.  you can definitely smell a hot electronic smell also.  no issues from rambo and hbp seems to be functioning properly.  things to check before i swap out to a different heater / plate?","well, i got replacement connectors from digikey and repaired my existing cables. i did have to replace the connector shells, as the scorched pins had fused themselves with the plastic and could not be removed. i added solder to all the crimped connections for the heater power while i was at it.  with the repaired cable i can feel a slight warmth near the connector when the heater is powered.

i also bought some of the connectors that piercet mentioned and built a new cable and harness using that.  i printed an adapter for the panel mount connector, and i reused the threaded, brass inserts from the old, burned out connector.  with the new cable i don't notice (by hand) any warming of the connector when the heater is powered. 

here are a few pictures.

edit: i've added the freecad and stl files for the adapter plate."
tips for resolving y-axis being off about 0.10mm,"hey just looking for the best way to resolve my y-axis printing about 0.10mm ish wider than the x-axis when printing a 20mm by 20mm calibration cube. 

this is the cube i have been testing with:
https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1278865

when i print it i usually see around z-axis=20.06mm x-axis=20.06mm y-axis=20.16mm... ish my digital caliper is cheap and has a little wiggle room but it shows a fairly consistent difference in the y-axis being a bit off.

should i try to adjust the endstop switch on that axis so that when it homes it is -0.10mm less that it was before?","okay had some time and printed all the cubes out and this was my results:

60x60mm
x= 60.25
y= 60.30
z= 60.02

40x40mm
x=40.25
y=40.25
z=39.98

20x20mm
x=20.20
y=20.20
z=20.02

10x10mm
x=20.20
y=20.20
z=20.03

i put down an rough average based off three or more measurements on each side. it looks like i really don't see a difference in y compared to x till i get to the 60x60mm cube. z looks to be just about right no matter what size i print at but x and y look to be off by .2mm or more on all the prints tested. 

i also changed out my $10 harbor freight pittsburgh digital caliper for a slightly more upscale $25 one made by igaging to see if i can get more consistent measurements. i then tightened the belts for both x and y so that i think helped get both axis a little more consistent. 

not sure what to do here, when i print benchies and other prints that test other aspects of the printer i get great results outside of dimensional accuracy. i know .2mm tolerance is fine for most prints but if i wanted to print single prints that involve interconnected moving parts like the nasa wrench i would assume i would what to try dial the accuracy in a little more right or am i just driving myself crazy? 

any other things i could try/test to see if i can get my x/y closer to the accuracy of my z axis?"
titan aero? anyone consider installing one?,curious if this would make for a clean all in one (hard and flex material) head.,"okay had the titan aero installed for about a week now. spent most of my time re-calibrating do to issues with the printer not the extruder but i printed off a few functional parts and a benchy and i think they came out very well. i got the 1.75 version with a .4 nozzle and printed at .2 layer height.

have not tested flexible material though and i think that is half the reason why you would want to go with this extruder but if i do get some tpu and remember to post pack here i will.

one side note i did run into one issue where the extruder will strip the filament when i ran though my start up script but all i had to do was dial down the extrusion rate in the script it started to work as expected. 

also as we speak printing out a warhammer 4k figure for my brother in-law with a .25 nozzle at .1 layer height. i will try and pull off the support and send a picture of it as well once it is finished."
taz 6 extruder on taz 5,"hi-

i recently bought a taz 6 extruder for my taz 5.

overall it is working great.

i have noticed though that the dual cooling fans dont really spin up until 30-40% speed. is this normal? a firmware issue?

best,
joe","darn!

i have been using sebastian's linear advance firmware for some time - it makes for nicer prints! the compile settings are based on the older firmware from lulzbot i believe.

so, if i were using the old lulzbot firmware would 100% be the same as 100% on the new, or would the new crank it up even higher?

it seems that when the fans are over 90% the hot end has a hard time holding temps in the 230 range. is this also a firmware issue?

oh - i bent out the end-stop switch a tad, and the carrige clears nicely. also, you have to adjust your build plate size in whatever slicer you are using because having bent the end stop switch you shift everything to the right 5 mm or so and the extruder can go beyond the build platform.

best,
joe"
quick question about taz environmental considerations...,"first, stone cold old fart noob here. zero direct 3d print knowledge/experience. 

that said, a taz6 is on my shortlist of possible printers to scratch my latest itch. i'm curious if such a machine could live in my wood shop/garage next to my shapeoko cnc/3.8 watt laser, across from the table saw and bandsaw. what i'm saying is, a sometimes dusty place.  can i just blow the dust off and print? or, do i need to isolate the printer to protect it from dust?

if dust is a problem could i build some sort of positive pressure enclosure that would not affect printing?  i'd really prefer to keep it in the garage if at all possible. 

thanks! 




","tmh wrote:great info, thanks. first step in learning what questions to ask. i'm in socal, so it can get a bit hot on occasion. will start researching temp requirements now. i'd guess type of filament has animpact?

a dramatic impact. the two most common are pla which is short for polylactic acid and is made from corn starch, and abs or acrylonitrile butadiene styrene which is made of dead dinosaurs. pla is generally considered easier to print, and is very dependant on fan cooling, but adheres well and usually doesn't lift. abs is stronger (well, significantly less brittle anyways) and resists melting at higher temperatures it will tend to lift away from beds easier and split easier. you may have difficulty printing it in a garage, but i find it much more useful. i print mainly in abs. there are also flexible filaments that result in a rubber like part, filled materials made of wood or stone or metal dust, and newer plastics such as ngen or in nova as well as super high temperature polycarbonate, etc. i started with abs, but most people start with pla. a taz uses 3.00mm filament, which is never actually 3.00mm (it's usually close to 2.85) this is important to know so that you don't accidentally buy 1.75mm filament, the other common standard."
tensioner boby keeps breaking,i have had the body that contains the extruder bolt break at the pivot point and i am not sure why this keeps happening.  is it my prints or heat or tightening to much?,"that is probably the extruder idler, and they are a known failure point. the older (pre verson 1.4) idlers were slightly too narrow in one dimension, that causes them to fail prematurely. they issued a service builtin about them. you can print the latest version here: http://download.lulzbot.com/taz/6.02/pr ... ler_block/ 

there is also a newer alternative version that is featured on the mini, but will fit the taz just fine known as the ""beefy"" extruder block. it is stronger, but weighs slightly more. you will need to also change the latch if you use this one. 

http://download.lulzbot.com/mini/1.04/p ... der_idler/
http://download.lulzbot.com/mini/1.04/p ... ler_latch/

you may have your idler tension arms too tight, or the one you printed may not have had the correct interlayer bonding temperature when you printed it (for example if you printed them in abs at 230 instead of 240). 

if your printer isn't functional at the moment because of the failed idler, call lulzbot support even if it is no longer under warranty. since there was a service bulliten they may be willing to ship you a replacement. you can also temporarily glue it back together using acetone, plastruct plastic weld or hobby model cement.

if its the extruder body that broke, that is unusual. you can find that file here: http://download.lulzbot.com/taz/6.02/pr ... _body_hex/
breaking there would also be due to overtight idler tension bolts."
dual extruder calculator taz6,"after going through the calibration routing, it seems that the calculator has the x value inverted. 

after running it at the initial settings it suggested a 0,920x and a -50.15y, this increased my error in the x direction and inverting it to -0.920x seemed to bring the calibration squares into alignment..","i may have an update. i got to the right values by xchanging top for bottom and left for right values in the calculator. it took me a day and 12 iterations to understand how this bloody thing works. i think its a bug, or they understand something different under the term: top  

still the dual extruder gives me a hard time. i'm using the flexy dual extruder v2 on taz6. the guy in the factory has such a bad handwriting, that i#m still not shure if the e-steps number is a 4 or a nine. 

i'm into 3dprinting for 2 years now, using ultimaker 2 and 2+ for hundreds of hours. i saw a lot of possible hardware issues, but alignment of the dual head is still a blackbox, also cause the 3d printed mount of the big toolhead moves a lot back and fourth. if you have the nozzle calibrated for this print, it can be miss calibrated at the next one. 

at the end, its about price. if you charge 500 bucks for something that is beta. c'mon..."
nozzle pressing into washers when doing bed level,"i am in the process of fine tuning my taz 6 to get it truly dialed in and noticed something a little strange while trying to figure out how to dial in the z-axis. when the bed levels it touches the nozzle to all four corners but when it does i notice it would bush into the two front washers just enough you can see that corner flex before it would stop then when it did the back two it would almost just touch it an pull back instantly.

i assume that this is not normal and that the testing of that back two washers were working a expected but there was something wrong with the front two. i figured there was a conductivity issue between the bed to the washers to the nozzle. my first though was it was plastic on the nozzle but the nozzle looked perfectly clean and there were no issues with the back two washers so that could not be the case. so then i though something with the front two washers to i removed them and put them back on. 

as far as i can tell there might have been a slight improvement in adjusting and cleaning the front two washers but to enough to keep the nozzle from flexing the bed a little as it probes them. 

just looking for someone to verify the normal behavior of the testing is that the nozzle is supposed to just barley touch the washer to the point you almost cant tell they are even touching and then pull back immediately. also if that is the case any tips on how to get the front two washer corners working like the back two washer corners?","titan8883,

1. is your wiping pad dirty/gunked up with old plastic? i have this problem more with pla then with higher temp plastics like petg
     yes, after reading this i replaced it with a new one. 
2. have you tried heating up the nozzle (temp depends of the kind of plastic you have been printing with) and wiped it down really well with a lint free cotton cloth of some kind?
      yes/no i did wipe it down but not with a lint free cloth but with a kitchen sponge with the green scratchy side. once again after reading i tried wiping it down with a lint free paper towel.
3. check that during the pre-heat before leveling that there isn't any filament ooze getting in the way.
      i do check and i saw no oozing and the nozzle is basically new.

after trying your recommendations it started to work perfectly! now i just see a ""kiss"" on all washers with no bending of the bed. not sure if it was replacing the wipe pad or the lint free paper towel or both but it did the trick.

i thought i had it clean since it was visibly clean but it looks like something as small as a piece of lint may have caused it. 

thank you titan8883!"
retraction issue when setting extruder temp and wait command,"i just changed out the default single toolhead that comes with the taz 6 with the new e3d titan aero toolhead you can get at itwork3d. i got the 1.75 version. 

i then tried printing a few calibration cubes and noticed many of the times i tried printing the filament would be striped before it started to print. i messed around with it and noticed my startup script would retract the filament right before it ran the nozzle through the wiper. 

i pulled out a couple lines of the relevant gcode and came up with these two lines for testing:

m109 s170 ; soften filament for z homing
g1 e-12 f100 ; retract 12mm filament

basically it tells the extruder to wait and warm up to 170 before running the next command then the next line would retract 12mm of filament from the extruder to prevent filament from oozing out of the nozzle while doing a wipe and auto bed level.

i thought maybe retracting 12mm was too much for this new toolhead  and wanted to step it down to something like 5mm. 

so i tried running these commands by themselves in the octoprint terminal window and something strange happened. if skipped the m109 command and heated the extruder manually to 170 and just ran the ""g1 e-5 f100"" retraction command by itself it would seem to retract fine at about 5mm. but if i cooled down the hot end then ran the ""m109 s170"" command then right after that run the ""g1 e-5 f100"" command, it would start to warm up get to about 161 ish according to the lcd screen on the taz 6 then start the retraction process. the issue is that when it retracted it retraced way more than 5mm and ended up grinding on the filament till it stripped it.

ran this test a few more times and every time i ran the ""m109 s170"" before i ran the retraction command no matter if i tell it to retract only 1mm it still would retract for like 15 seconds straight. 

any ideas why m109 command first seems to ignore my retraction length settings and just keep retracting for an extended period of time?","you may be in absolute extraction mode (m82). it may retract an unexpected amount to reach the length you are telling it to go to if so. if e=5 and you tell it to go to length e-12 that is 17 mm. if you are at e=20 then that is 32mm.

e = current extruded distance/length the firmware thinks it is at from the origin (e=0).

you may need to set it to relative mode (m83) and reset the extruder length(g92 e0). ymmv."
possible to save the leveling grid instead of repeating every print?,"i'm curious as to whether it's possible to auto-level and save the results, as opposed to running auto-level before each and every print.

thanks! 

chop","the only problem i see is that there's a lot of travel between z-home and bed and thus a lot of room for error on consecutive prints. much less so between washers and bed. so, alhough time consuming, i think i'll stick with g29 for the time being."
modified heatsink fan duct for taz-6 with leds,"i have created a modified version of the heatsink fan duct for the taz 6
changes: bend the duct by 45 degrees to get fan out of the way so you can see what the print head is doing.
add led mounts to the duct so that you can add white leds to illuminate the print head, and get it out of the shadows.

extruder motor not turning,"after taking the extruder off my taz6 this morning to replace the gears, i find that the extruder motor isn't turning. i thought i had broken a wire or something, but i see 2.5ohm on both pairs all the way back to the connector on the controller board, and when i plugged the extruder motor into the x-axis, the motor turned fine (and vice versa, the x-axis motor did not move when plugged into the extruder).

so whatever the problem is, it looks like it's on the board. which is mighty coincidental given that i took the extruder off... is there a history of static electricity damage to the drivers? is there anything else to troubleshoot? i gather there are no separate fuses to the different drivers.

to use the secondary extruder driver, do i have to reflash with the dual extruder firmware?",found another post that said the extruder won't move unless it's hot. indeed. nothing to see here.
"z axis out of sync, jammed again","i'm beginning to think i either have a lemon or the two-screw taz 6 is a fundamentally broken design. 

when i first bought this printer a month ago, its z-axis wedged up fairly quickly. i carefully followed the x-axis leveling procedure and ran a few more prints through it. today, it's all wedged up again. 

the set screws on the steppers seem tight. i'll go ahead and level the x-axis again. does anyone have any suggestions for fixing this problem so it stays fixed? i elsewhere someone saying they'd printed some alignment tools, but couldn't figure out what they were talking about. 

i bought this printer to make some big parts and i don't trust for a moment that it's going to run them to completion. 

thanks!","z axis jamming is not normal, usually it involves either an x axis already out of sync, a loose z motor coupler, or a broken z motor coupler. in rare cases it can be a  lower z motor mount down too far on the frame. here are the troubleshooting steps.

1. check the top of both leadscrew where they enter the upper leadscrew bearing. they should both be up nearly flush with the center hub, the same on both sides, and you should not be able to manually move either leadscrew up or down in the bearing socket. 
2. check both motor couplers.  at least one of the two setscrews on the top and bottom of the coupler should be down and tight on the flat spot on the leadscrew and the motor shaft. all 4 screws should be present. 
3. check the leadscrew couplers for cracks, also see if the x motor shafts look intact. a rare failure mode can involve a cracked z motor shaft but that was mainly taz 5s that are affected. 
4. with the printer off and at z0 home, measure the distance from the left leadscrew nut bottom to the top of the lower z motor bearing. measure that same distance on the other side. it should be identical. if it isn't, manually turn the leadscrew until they match. 
5. check that all 4 bed corner washers are down, tight and not wobbly. 
clean the horned nozzle really well, making sure the tip  is shiny for good metal contact, a red scotchbright pad is good for this, never ever ever use a wire brush
6. now re run the bed leveling routine and print the bed leveling pattern to make sure everything looks right. 

you should be set then. if not, there are a few other things to try. you may also want to call support as well at that point."
"taz 6 physical printing stops but software thinks print is still going - ""too long extrusion""","hello fellow users!

my printer paused mid print under suspicious circumstances (see ""the story"", ""the problem"", and ""some clues"" below) and i was wondering if anyone else out there has ever encountered and/or solved this situation?

the story:
i was printing 3x gear bearings (abs) from thingiverse (a file i have successfully printed hundreds on its own (yes, it is a totally sweet object... https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:53451  )).  

the problem: 
after the raft layers went down perfect, approximately 1/2 way into the 1st layer of the print, the tool head stopped moving and stopped extruding (i.e. ""froze"" in place above the print).  

some clues:
the taz 6 lcd panel indicated ""taz printing..."" 
cura seemed to think the print was still going (i.e. if i hit pause, the tool head moved away from its ""frozen"" position, and if i hit resume, the tool head moved back to its frozen position and remains frozen) 
also, the bed heater kept temp at 110c and nozzle heater kept 240c temperatures.
cura also left the following mysterious output in the print dialog window:

< echo:unknown command: ""n3485y126.217 e7023.56914*64""
< echo: too long extrusion prevented
< echo: too long extrusion prevented
< echo:unknown command: ""9""

a useless (but salient) theory:
i suspect that if i restart the print and only try to print 1x of these gear bearings, the print will go to completion...","and yes, i printed the object again by itself and it worked perfectly..."
had to learn it the hard way never reboot pc while attached to taz,"o/

so i'm 14 hours into a print that is running from the sd card in my taz 6. windows is bugging me to reboot from a recent update. i'm like sure i'm printing via sd so sure why not. pc shuts down print is still going pc reboots and bam! print stops. i'm like what the! i think something is wrong, check the printer, no error. hit pause then resume, just sits there. start searching the forums and bam there it is.

if you are printing from sd just go ahead and unplug that usb cable. that way if your pc reboots your print is not stopped.

damn woodfill is expensive too!












","i had a similar experience. i think many do...eventually.

my solution: spend about $35 and buy a raspberry pi, install octoprint, and make your printer autonomous.

soooo much better. now, once i upload my files to the raspberry, i'm done with the computer plus now i can manage and view (with a cheapo webcam) the job from anywhere in the world."
printer stops midprint,"i am trying to print a wrist brace on my taz 5 and everytime i print it it stops mid print. i have been printing smaller objects and they print perfectly. it stops usually after an hour and it keeps printing in air but stops extruding. the nozzle is not clogged because it prints good for other objects. i have tried playing with the settings in cura but nothing seems to be working. i tried printing it upright and sideways neither of which turned out. i believe it is messing up on the support structure.

if anyone could help figure out what the problem is and how to print this. i have attached a picture of the brace i am trying to print and a picture of what it looks like after it stops printing.","a couple things could be going on here.  for starters though, what kind of plastic are you attempting to print? the symptoms could be indicitive of a failing barrel cooling fan if you are trying to print pla, but either way it looks like at least one side of your print bed is out of level. see the area where it skipped the perimiter run and replaced it with just dots? that usually indicates either the nozzle is too close to the bed, or that your idler is way too loose and isn't feeding. it can also be a bore lock issue. if you are printing abs you may be getting some lifting that is effectivly blocking the nozzle as well. there could also be either some overextrusion, or thin walls in need of additional fan going on, it's difficult to tell. 

if it were me, i would start by checking the bed for level against the nozzle at all 4 corners, checking both leadscrew nuts to make sure the bottom of the nut is the same distance from the top of the lower bearing on either side, etc. then clean the hobbed bolt chamber really well, make sure the idler arm bearing still moves, and tension the idler arm springs down to at least 8mm distance between the washers, etc. then check the bed pattern and try again."
endstops hit: x - layer shifts,"hi all,

just started a print after a little break ~2 months of using the machine and after a small relocation of the printer and i'm getting an error on the display of endstop hit: x and causing a layer shift that ruined the print.  luckily it didn't waste much filament but it's still annoying.  can anyone help me troubleshoot?  is it a loose wire perhaps? problem with the gcode?  i had a little tangle that caused the printer to bind up a while back and caused the z axis to grind but i levelled that out and doesn't seem to be an issue anymore but never had an issue with the x.  for the record is x side to side or front to back?  it seems to be a side to side shift but also slightly front to back. 

the print isn't using the full build plate - i'd say 10x10 inches or so.














","so an update...i re-ran the print and the failure occurs exactly as before.  literally the exact same error, same amount of layer shift, etc.  i'm wondering if this might be a problem with the gcode perhaps?

i will try to re-process the model and try again.  hmm

it appears it might have been a corrupt gcode file.  i re-processed the mesh in cura and am printing again.  i seems to be running clean now *fingers crossed* - we'll see in 30 hours."
suggestions on cleaning up print,"i've had my taz 5 for 2 yrs now. i just noticed the print quality deteriorated a little. any suggestions? the 2 parts are left and right,  2 different files and printed ~4"" away from each other on the print bed at different times. the dirty parts of the print appear to be at the same area of the parts.
i'm using cura.

any suggestions? 



","when a 3d printer starts a new layer, it can start the layer either on the inside and do the perimiter last, or on the outside first and fill in. when it starts on the outside (which for some stupid reason is the default on most slic3r setups) it leaves a slight mark where the nozzle starts extruding. you can also tell the printer to always try and start at about the same position on the layer, which makes kind of a zipper looking seam, or you can tell it to randomize the starting point. it looks like you have it set to randomize the starting opint, but print the exterior perimiter first. for a smoother outer layer you want to do the perimiter last instead."
flexion vs e3d titan aero?,"hi everyone,

thanks!","i use various flexion extruders with good results now.  i've implemented them with both dual extrusion and stand alone for their ht(high temp) and standard solution.  be aware they are ptfe or partially ptfe lined hot ends--especially the standard will not be suitable for materials at high temps.

also be aware that they lack the torque that would be necessary for high speeds since they are direct drive.  it sounds like you are working commercially?  i don't have that issue and have no desire to push speeds higher than stock which the flexion seems to work fine for.

is this heat creep? (taz 5),"hey all,
in the last couple days, i've been experiencing a new problem with my taz 5 which i've never had before: a totally hopeless clog that requires me to take apart the extruder. the first happened just after i finished a print, removed the prior filament, and inserted new filament (both pla—atomic filament and matterhackers pro pla) to begin a new one. but the newly inserted filament apparently immediately got jammed, not moving forwards or backwards. i also could not remove it by unlatching the idler and pulling it out; it was so stuck, i ended up lifting the entire printer trying to remove it—and i think that may be why part of the extruder body is now cracked, so that's also cool.  i removed the nozzle, which was empty. there also was nothing in the heater block. there was filament stuck in the heat sink and a ""plug"" just at the beginning of it. first clog: http://i.imgur.com/ryp803a.jpg i couldn't get all the filament out, but once i removed the plug, i was able to reinstall the extruder assembly, heat it up to temperature, and put some cleaning filament through to clear it out. i then completed two (relatively short—about 3-4 hours) prints in pla, though the space between the heat sink and heat block leaked a bit. (i think i successfully tightened it up, subsequently.)

the next clog i observed today after waking up to a failed print. also pla (push plastic... i have had no end of troubles getting this to print well on another taz, too ), also nothing blocking the nozzle or the heater block, but the heat sink is stuffed right up. the filament going into the heat sink looks swollen, and i'm at a loss as to how to safely remove it without borking everything. here's the picture: http://i.imgur.com/i2yddxu.jpg the failed print had a lot of extremely underextruded layers, interspersed throughout with increasing frequency, until it finally failed. here's a picture of a piece of the print which might help diagnose the issue (it broke apart when removing it from the bed): http://i.imgur.com/t6bhi3u.jpg. if this is heat creep, i don't know if it caused the print to fail or merely happened later, because it kept ""printing"" while not moving the filament through.

so i think i probably need to put a beefier fan on there to cool the heat sink? is there a temporary solution, like just pointing a big, honking fan at the whole print in the meantime? but most importantly, how can i get the rest of that pla clog out? would a hair drier get it soft enough to remove? i don't have any pla solvents on hand.

thanks for your help.","that sure looks like heat creep. make sure the micro blower is working constantly and is pointed directly at the fins. also keep an eye on your nozzle temps, a failed thermistor could cause nozzle overheating to a point it overwhelms the micro blower."
request for help - lulzbot taz 5 printing issues,"hello,

i am brand new to the forums. i purchased my first lulzbot, a taz 5, this past ~march. when i first got it, it was working fantastic for a few weeks until the nozzle clogged. i replaced the copper nozzle with a nickel plated .05 nozzle and broke down + cleaned the entire extruder head assembly. after i reassembled and re-calibrated it was printing better than ever - the highest quality prints i've had since purchasing the machine - i was very happy with the performance. that all abruptly ended about a month ago. i was attempting to print a mother's day gift when (see attached pics of pink print fails) the extruder head suddenly started rubbing against the print. i left my house and when i came back after the print had been going for about 2 hours, i could literally hear a very awful sounding rubbing/scraping noise coming from the print. i rushed over and killed the print and shut the printer down.. the results are pretty ugly.. this was the event that began my printer woes.

after many experiment runs after, it looks like after the prints reach a certain height the extruder head starts to get ever so closer to the print until it eventually starts to physically knock against the print as its trying to extrude filament -- this is evident by the squished looking layers from the side profile shots i took. also notice the very top layer - the top is very wavy looking due to the extruder head dragging across.

i have since recalibrated multiple times, adjusting z-stopper and re-leveling the bed, but to no avail. mind you i have not adjusted anything about the extruder settings -- to be honest i don't want to screw anything up in there because i don't know what i am doing yet.

the parts never grow tall enough to ever physically rub against the extruder head now.. they just start peeling up at ~10mm layer height. even my calibration cubes lose adhesion on the bed and eventually fail. i've attached pictures of that as well. i'm convinced my axes are out of whack at this point..

i was suspicious my heat bed may have been going out so i ran a couple of experiments. i used my digital laser infrared thermometer and shot the heat bed in a 3x3 grid fashion. first capture of data was the original orientation i left the bed in after the problem started to occur. the second capture of data was after i snugged the heat bed all the way down close to the aluminum y travel plate - i figured this might help keep the heat bed a little hotter with less space for air to pass through and cool off the heat bed from below. not once did my bed actually reach the desired temperatures: 60, 65, 75, 100. the recordings are extremely variable with no consistency whatsoever. as i attempt to reach 100 degrees celsius the standard deviation increases. 

is this a good indicator that my bed is going bad and needs to be replaced?? - or - are my suspicions that the axes are all out of whack more accurate?

i just purchased a dual extruder head because things were going so well — i just want to be printing again.. somebody help!!!

thanks,

e","it's almost certainly an axis, probably a lead screw out of allignment. the part and brim arent cutled up so lifting probably isnt in play which means the bed is probably fine. looking at the part, the overextruded ripple section starts on one side before it hits the other side. thats probably the affected side. to troubleshoot: 
1. check both z motors. ensure all 4 setscrews in both couplers are down, tight and the couplers have at least 1 setscrew on each flat spot.  
2. check for broken or cracked couplers, and loose or out of alignment motors. 
3. now check the bed frame to main frame mounts. are they down and tight. are the rubber feet front and back setting on the table surface. are any of the heat set inserts pulled out? also check that the bed frame rails are 90 square to the main frame rails.
4. now check all 4 bed mount corners. are all 4 of them still screwed into the bed mounting plate? are they all around the same height? if they are within 1 to 2mm of the others leave them for now. if you see both couplers on the right or left sides are dramatically higher on one side, lower them to match the shorter side. 
6. now locate a thin, business card thickness metal object. this will be our bed feeler gauge. turn the printer on, let it heat bed and nozzle to normal print temperature. then home the printer so the nozzle is at the front left corner. using the feeler gauge, move the bed adjustment screw for that corner until the nozzle is just touching the feeler gauge sitting on that bed. beware of burns here. now move the nozzle to the back left corner and do yhe same thing. it should be fairly close, adjust it until it is perfect. 
7. now, pause and using vernier calipers, measure the distance from the lower left lead screw nut bottom to the top of the lower left lead screw bearing. now check the same distance on the right. the right side should be identical to the left. if it is not, power off the machine, unplug that motor (or turn it really slowly when you do this next part) and then manually turn the lead screw with your fingers until it matches on the right side as well. 
8. now, heating the machine back to temperature if required, slowly move the nozzle to front right corner. if you had to adjust the lead screw make sure you don't drag the nozzle through the bed. adjust it down as you go if needed. once that nozzle is done, do the back right corner. at this point your nozzle is trammed to the bed in theory. 
9. find the bed calibration gcode file on the sd card or in downloads here on the site and then run that file a few times to make sure you have good adhesion. adjust the main bed leveling screw accordingly, and then the corners slightly with quarter turns until the pattern is perfect.
10. get some white lithium grease and put it on the leadscrews just above the lead screw nut, then run up and down the z axis to distribute it on the lead screw. never lubricate the bearing rods. 
11.after running up and down the z axis, go to z0 home at the bed, then measure both distances from the bottom of the lead screw nut to the top of the lower bearing again. they should still be identical. 
12. now try printing a calibration object, preferably a 40mm calibration cube. check that it prints well, has no major flaws, and measures close to 40mm on each side with calipers. if you are still getting overextrusion at that point make sure infill is at 85% or lower, check the diameter of the filament with calipers and adjust in cure as needed.
13. if you are printing pla and it still looks rough, it may be the squirrel cage fan on the barrel. when they fail, they often partially fail so they look like they are still moving but they move little or no air. 
14. if it still prints bad, check back here. there are other things to try as well."
dual extruder calibration,"hi all 
this may well be a stupid question however...
i have just installed a dual extruder onto my taz6. everything went quite smoothly and i am printing the calibration squares fine.

i measure the four gaps and enter the values into the offset calculator and each subsequent print gets worse.
so my stupid question is.
in the calibration calculator when it refers to left gap, right gap, top gap and bottom

sitting in front of the printer is the top gap the at the rear of the print bed?
as per the photo below
just confirming

thanks","hey it looks like the belts might be a little loose. go ahead and check the tension and if they are a bit loose, tighten them like in step 2 of this ohai https://ohai.lulzbot.com/project/final- ... bly/taz-6/ . be careful not to over-tighten them as that can cause other issues.

as far as the top feature being blob, you can decrease speed, increase fan, or print two of the same object at once to give each layer a chance to cool off. i believe there is a minimum layer print time in the cooling section of the advanced settings in cura. increasing that should help that top feature turn out better."
taz 6 stepper drivers,"i'm interested in upgrading my stepper drivers in my taz 6 in hopes of quieting the printer a bit as well as getting higher precision. i'm thinking maybe drv8825 drivers. is there a way to do this on the rambo board where you would bypass the integrated steppers? i asked this question in another forum and someone said it was possible, but i can't find the recommended schematics for doing this.","you could, kind of, but the latency involved in the conversion would make it not great. also the rambo board already uses a4988 stepper anyways, which are pretty solid. i guess the 1 / 32nd microstepping might make for a bit less noise. you would probably be better off going with a new board. 

here's a comparison of both motor drivers. 
http://reprap.org/wiki/a4988_vs_drv8825 ... ver_boards

if you really wanted to do that anyways, you would either need to try and convert the signal back to stepper feed (maybe by removing the reverse current resistors on another stepper driver and wiring it in reverse and then putting the stepper you want to use at the end of the chain. ) or somehow tapping into the rambo board traces which would be risky at best."
filament bending at top of exstruder,"because the filament guide tube is not held in place before it enters the exstruder, the filament tends to bend at far right and left ""y"" positions.
this bending was causing the filament not to feed through the hobbed bolt feeder and was grinding away the filament. i crated a simple part to hold the filament tube perpendicular the the print head. this part only took 20 minutes to print and has saved me much headaches. here is a picture of the part. i have also found this part helps with printing with 1.75mm filament","just what i need.  backwards force of the filament wore off the back prong of the my guide block.   without the back prong, i'm getting 100% failed prints from the exstruder wheel slipping.  i was already thinking about something like a disk around the tube to hold it forward.  it looks like this will do the trick better.

i've only had before exstruder slippage when using village plastics natural pla.  i tried other things like mounting the pla overhead.  i thought less tension/friction might help.  didn't help much.  maybe this will fix that also.

now to see if i have a longer metric screw.  i have loads of m2s, m3s, and m4s, but no m2.5s.  m3-20mm.  got it.  had to drill out the holes.  3mm for net.  6.5mm for tube.

line voids in prints,"i am getting line voids in my prints.  i have tried to change filaments (esun pla, hatchbox pla, lulzbot abs) and have had the same issues.  you can see it in this picture the voids which go horizontally across the part all the way through to the infill.  they dont cover an entire layer.  could this be a slicer issue?  i am using the most recent cura lulzbot edition.","i've been having the same issue for a while. it was solved by tightening the idler screws. there is a jig that you can download and stick between the idler and the screws for the correct distance. iirc the thickness is around 8mm between the washers. i even had to tighten a bit more to make the void lines go away.
i also noticed some filaments are more vulnerable for this phenomenon. my white pla especially. for some reason the teeth in the feeder 'eat' more easily in this filament."

z-axis repeated binding,"i've had my taz-6 for just over 1 week and i've got a repeating issue of the z-axis binding on one side resulting in the printer continuing it's prints but not moving upwards and destroying the prints.

it failed it's first print of the rocktopus with the left stepper motor binding, spoke with tech support and was advised the gantry must have been knocked out of level during shipping. with the stepper motors disabled i was able to re-level the gantry and on attempt 2 it completed the test print. problem solved, or so i thought.

following this it made some successful prints of relatively flat objects no problem, i then encountered exactly the same issue as before with the left stepper motor binding and causing the printer to drag the extruder head through the test piece as it carried on printing. spoke to tech support again and they requested an image of the main circuit board, confirmed the ""z"" control chip was in good condition and gave me the procedure to re-level the gantry. hand level the gantry by turning the silver sections at the bottem, loosening the 4mm bolts on the carriage, taking it to the top of the z axis, autohoming from there, repeat twice, set to mid height on the z axis and tighten the bolts back just beyond hand tight. 

the next print following this was successful, the one after resulted in the exact same issue of a ruined test piece and a binding stepper motor. repeated the process and had exactly the same issue, first print is okay, second print is ruined. i was back on the phone to tech support and they are now asking me to do a firmware update on the lulzbot and share the files it's binding on, which is pretty much everything i've tried to print.

has anyone else run into these issues? 
at the moment i'm down about $50 of ruined material, quite a few hours of my time and i basically have a $2,500 paper weight on my desk.

thanks","hi,

when i received my taz 6 usps must have dropped kicked it all the way to my house so i had similar issues,

did you complete this in full?

this consists of the frame squaring and the x axis leveling.

then do a z home and recheck the x axis leveling again. re adjust if necessary. 

additionally i put white lithium grease on the z screws and ran the z full length up and down. (do not put the grease on the shiny x axis bars! just the screws)

then something is out of whack.

after completing the full frame squaring/x axis leveling procedure all of my issues went away, but i did have to redo the x leveling after z homing. (in cura blue z home)

i'm not sure what you have done so i hope this helps, if you have done all of this then i would definitely call tech support.

first benchy: how to improve!,"hello folks,
i just got a taz 6 for my office and i am trying to learn how to get the most out of the printer. so far adjusting the layer height (i have gone to .08mm for some of my more detailed items) seems to yield better prints (at the cost of print time) and i have backed off on the z axis a tad and that has given me a smoother print with less bubbles.

i did my first benchy on standard polylite pla settings (quickprint with standard print quality). i think it looks pretty good but i want to know what i can do to improve my prints! we will be using this to create prototypes to send for sculpt approval so the better the quality the quicker the turn around!

heres my benchy i appreciate any feedback that i can get, just please remember this is my first printer and i have 0 experience with 3d printers other then knowing they are super cool.

thanks

taz 6 drags nozzle on print,"i seem to be having an issue with the nozzle dragging along the print as it goes over it. at first i contributed this to a bad cleaning strips, and maybe it was auto leveling wrong. i changed the cleaning strip, and even with a truly spotless nozzle it doesn't make a difference. what is going on, and how can i address this?

attached in the image. you can see the nozzle drag on the far left side, and also down the bottom right going towards the lower right corner, top right, and top circle. i played with increased retraction, and it is not the filament that is dragging, it is the nozzle.

http://imgur.com/u6dwhiz






thank you.","two things.

1. if you're having nozzle dragging, go under expert settings and increase your zhop a bit. z hop is the amount your nozzle is lifted after a retraction when it's moving across the part to print somewhere else.

2. can you send a picture of the bottom of this print? it looks like you might have a bit of overextrusion which can also contribute to nozzle drag because the plastic is smooshed out and the edges are too thick. a quick look at the bottom of the print would help confirm this. you might want to try backing off on your flow rate % by 1 to 2% just to try and send some pictures of the results.

i think in v16 you forget to put the little hole back for the screw that goes to the nut to hold swivel head.

using limonene to unplug hot end,"hi all,

i was wonder if i could use limonene to dissolve a hips blockage i have (i would disassemble the toolhead - so none would touch the abs).

it's in the upper end of the hotend (the header block is empty of plastic. i can't seem to get it hot enough to melt it out (cranked it up to 290º and tried to push it through with some filament as per the instructions, didn't seem to do anything).

i can't pull it out, as it's flush with the plate (snapped during to an attempt at pulling it out).

cheers.","hello,

i spoke to lulzbot tech support about this exact same topic of high heating the hot end and they strictly advised not to do it. they said the filament could crystallize inside the hot end. the best bet is to use nylon and do the cold pull method to remove a blockage or partial blockage. i had an issue with the moarstruder bubbling and popping and initially i thought it was the filament but it was a partial blockage. i tried clearing it with  pla but it didn't work. i tried a higher temperature on the hot end and extruding filament and it didn't work.
what did work was using the nylon at the rated temperature and doing a cold pull 5 times to completely clean the extruder.

speeding up print,"i am printing a 6""x6""x2.5"" pla box, with some internal parts.  i'm using a taz 6 with 0.5 mm nozzle.  the print time is quite long if i use my usual settings (22 hours), but if i set the layer depth to 0.15 mm, and the nozzle extrusion width to 0.7,  i get that time down to 12 hours.  there is no fine detail in this box, and the smallest feature is 2 mm.  is there any reason not to use the relaxed settings to speed this up?

thanks in advance for any insights.

john doner",well you have a 0.5mm nozzle. if you set it to 0.7mm it will leave .1mm of empty space on both sides of every single extrusion. it will not look great. far better to set the layer height to 0.32 to 0.42mm instead.
why i bought a taz 5,"after weeks of research and discussion, pulled the trigger last night and ordered a taz 5. they went on sale at amazon for $1870... amazon seems to have spot sales like this, and i wasn't ready/missed the last time, so i went for it.  i know it must get boring for those who are already knowledgable to take the time to answer the questions of yet another newbie, so i want to express my appreciation to this community for taking the time to educate me and answer my queries. i'm writing this, for what it may be worth for others, who are going through the process of buying for the first time. i know there's a ton of information out there, and it's often dated because 3d is a very dynamic technology.  ry 

 i started out with a list of 6 printers, ultimaker 2+ extended, makergear m2, zortrax m200, bcn3d sigma, lulzbot taz 5 & 6.  things that were important to me were: 

1. support community, and customer support. to me this is important part of not only buying a 3d printer, but owning and using one. i'm a scientist (healthcare), so i appreciate the critical brainstorming process involved in examining current methods/technology, problem solving and improving them.  for me lulzbot and makergear scored highest on support and vibrancy as a community. all of the printers have communities, but not all are not as populated by curious and involved people on a day to day basis. both companies also have stellar customer support from what i have been able to glean. 

2. printer quality/reliability, print quality and warranty. this was probably the most difficult and interesting part of the process for me to navigate as a newbie. i kept discovering what i don't know and i'd have to take time to get a little familiar (support community was really helpful here, both answering questions and reading existing info). in an emerging technology, there isn't always a clear cut, superior answer when it comes to what's in the box.  for instance, when i started out, a self leveling bed seemed like a must have for me, but the more i learned the less important it became because i was able to see it as an infrequent process on well built/stable machines. i read of plusses and minuses to bowden vs direct extruders, 1.75 vs 3 mm filament, type  and size of print bed, and on it goes.  then there is quality of parts and construction. a printer might start out great, but poor parts/construction might equate to ""wobble"" after hours of use resulting in poor outcomes.   not sure how good my process was in weeding through all this, time will tell, but the factors that weighed in for me were long term stability as evidenced by consistency of quality prints, minimal print failures and repair history over time. quality of print was more important for me personally, though again i learned that speed can be a reflection of quality build/machine stability. 

my final choice became a process of elimination. i tried to get as much objective info as possible, but the decision was ultimately subjective. here's my order of elimination and why i marked them off my list. i do want to qualify that this was not an easy process for me. i do not think, even with my limited knowledge, that any of these are 'bad' printers... indeed they all have strong followings and great qualities. 

1. the zortrax was first the first to be eliminated from my list. on the pro side, it got high marks for excellent print quality, consistency, reliability. on the con side was it's proprietary attributes, apparent poor customer support, and limited filament support. on the zortrax forum i read stuff from customers who loved the machine but were frustrated with lack of company support when needed. those three things took it off my list pretty quickly.

2.  the ulitmaker was the second off my list. honestly, i didn't spend much time investigating the machine because of price. at 3k it was the most expensive printer and i couldn't discern any justification for the higher price. the acrylic frame vs metal also made it less appealing. 

3.  the bcn3d sigma was the third to drop off. this was a tough one. i really like this machine, but i didn't find the community to be as strong as i'd like. the internal housing for the filament reels is limiting and i'm edging towards direct drive over bowden. i've seen some mods that put the filament external, but the wasted space inside the printer framework that results kind of violates my personal sense of true upgrade. also concerned about part availability, there only seems to be one company selling them in the us.  still, a really cool machine though.

4. the makergear was the fourth to fall off my list. this one was also tough. for me the friendliness and vibrancy of the support community was neck and neck with lulzbot. the ceo frequents their forums and they strike me as an excellent company. it wasn't lost on me that had almost 10x the reviews on amazon that lulzbot has, and they are almost all positive.  the quality of their machine and support were unquestionable for me. what ended up eliminating them in a very close race at this point was a few things. they only have a 6 month warranty. i get the impression that their customers believe in them more than they believe in their selves. i think they assert, appropriately, the quality of their printer, but i do not see that confidence reflected in a 6 month warranty (especially when everyone else on the list has a 12 month warranty).  lcd  and slicing software are both add ons, adding another $300+ to their price tag if they're going to be compared with the other printers on the list. they seem a little slow to innovate to me, which makes me think they've maybe been a little reliant on their already great product and haven't kept up with the competition when it comes to stuff people are looking for and expecting from the current 3d printers in this price range.

5. taz 6. this one dropped off my list solely because of the price difference between it and the taz 5. it was a tough decision when i was comparing a $300 difference between the two, but when the price on amazon dropped to $1870 yesterday, the $630 price difference made the decision for me. the taz 6 was discounted on amazon a few weeks ago to 22something. had the 6 gone on sale again instead of the 5, i would have bought it. so, i bought the taz 5 yesterday along with 3 spools of filament (esun red abs, esun semi transparent petg and esun black plapro). 

the adventure continues   , looking forward to it.","hey sealfab,

thanks for commenting. i know the info i wrote may not be relevant for experienced people. i wrote it more for people new to 3d who are slogging through all the info out there and are involved in the decision making process. info that others have been kind enough to share helped me, so i'm adding to the stack.   

i looked for local places to buy, but none exist near me for the printers i was interested in. i had the same concerns about shipping, i've read so many horror stories about mishandled shipping. i'm in oregon and it turned out that my amazon purchase shipped from washington... not to bad, even got here a day early. i'm studying for a profession related test i'm taking tomorrow, so i have only unboxed and not actually played with the printer yet, but i seems to have not suffered any mishaps during shipping.  the packaging was impressive, very detailed and thoughtful. if the packaging is any indication, i've bought a well engineered machine lol.  i was pleasantly surprised by the sample print quality of the rocktopus that came with the printer and is presumably printed on my machine. also impressed by the fit and finish of the printer, especially all the wiring (i built a printer last fall, and there's a lot of wiring!). lots of attention to detail.

i like that the power source is all part of the machine on the 6 as well as the structural enhancements they made. for me, the auto leveling seems more geared to beginners (which i am) than experienced printers? fear of always having to tweak and level the bed was its appeal for me anyway. however, the more i read the more it seemed to me that leveling is an infrequent process with well made printers?  the geek in me wasn't thrilled by the idea of leveling with a piece of paper, so i bought a digital gauge for that purpose and actually kinda look forward to tuning the printer using it. time will tell if i made the right decision in that respect.

the one thing that would have swayed me to the 6 is if lulzbot had upgraded it to an open rail system (like piercet designed, he did a fantastic job). that's a sweet system and seems to be one of the more important refinements that can be made in 3d printing, effecting stability, reliability and ultimate print quality. that will likely be one of the first upgrades i do to my printer once i have some experience with it and am more familiar with its personality.

all things considered, at this point i'm still confident i made the right choice for me. overall i am very impressed with lulzbot and their product and with the lulzbot community."
flexydually (v1) printing issues,"apologies if this issue was posted elsewhere!

i have a flexydually (v1) that is giving me printing issues on the t0 (abs/pla) nozzle.

it will print product for about 1-10 layers then stop printing/pushing filament.
the black cog sort of thumps (thump thump thump) instead of pushing filament.
if i manually push the cog, i can easily get filament to extrude.
i've cleaned the nozzle a few times and tried 3 different types of material (abs, pla, tglase) with the same results.
my filament is not 'tore-up' from the feeder ripping into the filament.
it appears to heat up just fine - and to the correct temp per material selected.

i've printed many successful prints but all of a sudden this happened.
the ninjaflex (t1) nozzle is unaffected.

thoughts?","motors can go bad, but it is rare. in a nema 17 stepper motor there are two magnetic coils. if one of those coils isn't recievieing power, the motor will still move, but it will be kind of weak. the smaller motors found on the flexydually were more prone to burning out a coil than the bigger ones, so that may be the issue. it could also be that one or more of the 4 wires leading to the motor has a break in it somewhere, most likely at the harness connectors or the board, but it could be an actual bad wire. you'll want to test continuity with a multimeter to see if all 4 wires are good end to end if the motor swap doesn't fix it. you can also try swapping the motors on the existing unit and see if the issue follows the motor or follows the wire harness"
dumb question about taz6 bed (what's the button do?),"just setting up a taz 6, having come from a mini. the taz 6 startup process resembles that of my mini, except in the beginning, it gives this silver button a little boop. what's that all about? 

are the 4 corner discs not enough to level, or is it just giving itself a little high-five?

thanks.","i have a taz6.
the button is very helpful in detecting an error due to a goober of filament that does not wipe off while bed leveling.
it's sort of an over travel limit or rough zero so to speak.
when running pctpe filament, i sometimes run into a problem where my filament is slightly too wet.
if the filament is too wet, it swells quite significantly.
the cleaning program does not heat the pctpe up to a temperature where it gets soft enough to clean off the nozzle
on the wiping pad.
when that happens, the z axis drops down far enough to push very hard on the 1st measuring washer.
the button sets the maximum down travel motion so the printer is not damaged if an error occurs.
..
the strategy seems to make sense to me.
..
sorry about my long windedness here, but i hope this will help you better understand."
blobs all over the print surface,"as the attached image shows, the outer skin of my prints is very blobby. it is caused by large amounts of pla being extruded whenever a suck-then-prime step occurs, which is typically at the beginning of a perimeter.

i'm pretty sure the extruder is running correctly as the prints are not too thin or thick anywhere else. i've tried retraction settings from 1mm to 5mm and use 15mm/s retraction speed. the hot end is at 200 degrees, although i've tried it lower and higher without improvement.

it hasn't always done this and i don't think i've changed anything significant in the software configuration, which makes me think it is a hardware problem.

yesterday i took the hot end apart to put in some tape to stop the pla leaking problem, but the blob problem is just the same afterwards.

in case it's relevant, i use kisslicer and it is apparently sequencing the retractions properly, but the prime step always oozes too much plastic. i've asked it to start perimeters in random locations, otherwise the blobs build up on top of each other and cause other problems. i'm switching to inside-out perimeters, which should improve the aesthetics of the print, but it will still be a problem for thin / small areas.","rupert wrote:thanks @piercet. spreading the seams around and starting inside out definitely improves things.

retraction certainly used to work better for me, so i think something has got loose or out of alignment.

it could be nozzle tip wear. as the nozzle gets used it slowly bores itself larger, over several years of heavy printing, or a few months of printing with something abrasive like woodfill your 0.50mm nozzle can end up as effectivly a 0.55mm nozzle and cause things that appear to be over extrusion and under retraction. aside from that, the only physical modifiers would be wear on the gears, the idler arm tensioners coming loose, debris in the hobbed bolt chamber, or possibly a bearing going bad, particularily the one in the idler arm itself, though that is rare anymore with the sealed bearings. 

other possibilities can include ageing motors not operating quite as efficiently or thermistors that are not quite as accurate as they were and your temperatures could be off a few degrees."
no flyback diode on steppers?,"while squaring my frame (sigh) i had to unplug the machine and unscrew the y-plate. to do that, you have to slide the bed backwards. when i did that, the backlight on the led flashed even though the system was unplugged. it seems like that shouldn't happen. i guess be cautious about how fast you move that plate back (although i wasn't very quick about it this time).","there is not. most 3d printers don't have them. it seems like something that should be an easy retrofit, but there are none that i know of, so it's either harder to implement than it looks (maybe due to loose at best wiring color coding standards or cost?) or there is some good reason not to add them in."
rough section on all prints,"i have been getting a line around my prints. it's about 1mm thick. 
i have done the anti wobble mod and the openrail x modification and the problem has remained the same. 
the printer is a taz 4 with the hexagon hot end fitted. 
i have used cura and s3d and get the same results. 
i have checked everything is level. 

","that is classic z height problems and overextrusion.

two things you have to do.

1. use your calipers and measure the diameter of the filament in 4-5 spots and average the 5 diameters. put this diameter into filament diameter box. if you haven't measured your filament correctly, it will cause overextrusion and give you that print defect. most 2.85mm filament isn't actually 2.85mm. 2.83, 2.87, 3mm isn't uncommon.

after you're sure you have exactly the correct diameter:

2. print a new test part with a skirt. get out your digital calipers and measure the thickness of the skirt. this is the initial layer thickness. does your measured initial layer thickness match what your initial layer thickness is set for in cura? i'm guessing no. 

you can modify your z height of your nozzle under expert mode: machine: machine settings: z-offset. ex:  if you measure your skirt thickness to be 0.3mm, and cura initial layer height is set to 0.425mm, add about half the difference into z-offset (~0.06mm). print the part again and measure the skirt. maybe it measures 0.36mm this time. add half the difference between 0.36mm and 0.425mm (~0.03mm) and add that to the previous z offset (new z offset would be 0.06 + 0.03 = 0.09mm). print again and measure your skirt thickness and compare against initial layer thickness setting. repeat until measured skirt thickness matches initial layer thickness in cura.

if you can't find your zoffset settings, contact lulzbot support and they can point it out to you. 


3. if you've done steps 1 and 2 correctly, you should see improvement. if you haven't ever calibrated your printhead, then it's possible you'll need to reduce your flow % a few % to really dial it in.

if you complete steps 1 and 2, print a test cube and post a picture of the bottom side of the print and it will be easy to diagnose whether we need to mess with your flow %. 

classic problem, easily fixed. you just need to dial in your printer a bit.

need power supply for taz 5,"hi all

i got a taz 5 on an auction for $575 out the door with a roll of black pla. pretty sweet. but it didn't have the power supply. i've been trying to find what the part number for the power supply is in the documentation but to no avail. can someone with a taz 5 take the cover off the power supply and take a picture of the manufacturer's information? i can get a 24v 500w for under $100 but i want to see the specs on the existing one to double check everything. i can buy one for $195 they said but i can make one for about half that. thanks.

big_i80","big_i80 wrote:yep i found it. finally. they had the documentation for the power supply in the resources and documentation section in parts store. duh? not sure why the bom, connectors and everything else is stored there instead of with all the rest of the bom's in the downloads section. i think i'll actually get the mean well se-600-24 from mouser. it's 25 amps and cheaper than the 21 amp. then i'll just buy the connector and pins and make my own setup. the 25 amp is probably made more which is most likely why it's cheaper. thanks.

if you still remember, can you post the instructions for this? our taz 5 power supply died last night and it seems no one has the official one in stock. i've read several forums posts about the issue but everyone seems to just say ""hey i fixed it by making my own"" but not detailing *how*. i could probably figure it out, but i don't want to screw it up.

explain flexydually,"i find myself wanting for a little more detail on the print head pages on the lulzbot website (https://www.lulzbot.com/store/tool-head ... ol-head-v2).  i would like to know what exactly is the flexy dually.  how does it differ from the dually?  does it have one flexy head and one normal head?  does it have two flexy heads?

while i'm on the subject, it would be nice to know exactly how the flexy head is different from the normal head.  what makes it better for flexy material?

thanks","here is a picture of both dual extruders from above. the one on the left is the flexydually. you can see the top extruder is different, having a green block and small hole with a tube instead of an idler arm on a spring. this makes a tighter path up to and over the hobbed bolt so the filament can't bend. (the rear extruder is for ""normal"" filament and the front is for flexible.)

otherwise, they are pretty much identical except that the flexydually has 0.6mm nozzles and the ""regular"" dual extruder has 0.5mm nozzles.

hope that covers it.

trouble with z axis homing,i'm having a problem getting the z axis to move downward when it's trying to home on a taz 4.  it's like the steppers are binding up somehow. i can run it manually from the display up and down with no problems.  but when i tell it to home the x and y work be then it binds up.   i'm measured both sides and they're ok. it's not twisting.  the esteps are at 1600. i've swapped around the motors and still get the same thing. tried reflashing the firmware too. to 2014q3. i'm not to sure where to look at this point.,"i have been having this same problem.  i can move just fine in 1mm increments but not in 10mm increments with a jog speed of 20mm/s.  i made sure the x axis bars were level, lowered the speed, and checked the x axis belt's tension.  nothing helped. 

one thing i did notice some improvement on was after tightening the bolts holding the z-axis motor's in place it allowed me to move in 10mm increments at up to 7mm's.  while this was an improvement, i still can't auto home the z axis because the speed that requires is much higher than the jogging speed at 7mm/s.  i am going to try to lubricating the lead screws.  

if you know of a way to manually control the autohome's speed it would be great to hear.  i'll keep you posted if i figure anything out!"
taz 6 circle issue,"i'm having an issue with circles on my taz 6 with the dual extruder head. not a lot of hours on the machine, maybe 50.

as you can see from the image, roughly on the 45s ( bottom left, top right) i'm getting an error in the circle. i'm getting a +-0.25mm error depending on where i am in the circle. i've run it from 1200 mm/min to 3000 mm/min and it doesn't seem to make any difference. i could expect an issue at 0,90,180,270 deg but it's odd that it's happening at a position that both motors are not in transition. 

only thing i can think of is a xy scaling issue but it all measures out okay. printing a 100 mm square results in a 100.2x100.2 mm square. so 0.2% error which is negligible.

it's the highest quality slt solidworks will output so it's not the part file.

i have checked belt tension and everything seems fine. 

i'm running s3d.

any ideas how to fix this?

","ditto on this. i'm having issues of my own on a taz 5. imperfect circles and line pairing(which i also see in the picture) are caused by the same issue; a delayed response in an axis when switching motion direction. the challenge is finding what's causing the delay; resistance to motion in one axis, insufficient belt tension, slop in a carriage's motion, too high of an acceleration value or too high of a jerk value, to name what i know of. 

what i see in the picture suggests an issue in both x and y, but more y than x(assuming y is vertical in the photo and x is horizontal).

first i had it happen on the x axis and in my case what was happening was the x carriage was actually tilting parallell to the y axis every time it switched directions. i had to move the linear bearing holders closer together(after reprinting a backplate due to faults on the original causing the bearing holders to move again as i itghtened the screws) to make it wiggle less. i also moved the x motor all the way down so the belt is kind of pulling down on the carriage. i had originally moved it so the belt was level because in my mind that hsould result in the most accurate motion.

now i'm having it happen on the y axis, and once again partially on the x axis, i think. only on the y axis i can't seem to do anything that makes it go away. i've moved the linear rods around, i've moved the bearing holders around, i've tightened the holders bolts on one side while leaving the others loose, i've tightened the hell out of the y belt, i've added white lithium grease to the rods, and still i am getting oblong circles with points at 11 and 5 o'clock. 

at this point i'm very frustratingly out of ideas. for the op on the other hand i'd start with tightening the belts. on the y axis, loosen the motor mount and the idler bearing mount, then take the y axis off the printer(i think that's still possible on the 6) and flip it over to get to the clamp screws on the moving platform. tighten the belt by two or three teeth, clamp is back down, then retighten the bolts on the motor mount and idler mount.

for the x axis on taz printers it's not so easy. i'd recommend against loosening the set screws that hold the x ends onto the smooth rods. i did that and ended up with binding z screws because i got them too close together. for this one just loosen the clamps on the x belt while holding the free end of the belt with pliers, pull it one or two teeth tighter, and retighten. trickier than the y axis."
cable connector for heated bed getting very hot on controller side.,"hello,

as the title says, i just noticed that the connector  for the print bed on the back of the controller is very hot at the end of a print. i know it draws a lot of current, but is this to be expected? prefer not to start fires, as a general rule.

this is a taz 5, by the way.

thanks!","piercet wrote:the connector used on the taz 4 and 5 isn't rated for the full possible amperage. there are retrofit suggestions in the forum here that have been tested to work, the thread is here viewtopic.php?f=36&t=5773&p=35754&hilit ... tor#p35754

alternatively you can eliminate the fitting and run wire directly.

thanks as always! i ordered one of those metal connectors, and am probably going to just run the wire directly in the mean time. thanks again!"
taz 3 showing error mintemp,"i have a taz3 while printing with pla the filament stopped flowing when i looked at the extruder temp it had fallen down to 75c and had a error message at the bottom of the screen saying ""err mintemp"" i have no power to the extruder and cannot use the preheat setting. does anyone have an idea what might be wrong?","do you have access to a multimeter? if so, with the printer turned off and unplugged disconnect the hot end from the wiring harness and test hot end for the proper resistance. the smaller orange wires are for the thermistor and should read ~100k at room temperature. the larger red wires are connected to the heater resistor and should read between ~4-7 ohm. after measuring the resistances, test again while moving the wires slightly to see if that impacts the resistance measurements.

if the resistance readings you measure are close to the above ranges then the hot end is fine. you'll then want to look at the two connectors on the hot end, to ensure that they're fully seated. the error you encountered occurs when the printer loses the connection to the thermistor.

fyi: i deleted the other duplicate post in the ""user's gallery"" forum and moved all responses here to this thread."
taz 6 z - axis motors out of sync,"hi! 
i seem to be having a problem with my z axis motors.

how can i prevent this from occurring again?

any help is greatly appreciated!",check the motor couplers for a missing setscrew or damage. if it's not that it may be the z carriage  (x ends) are spaced too far in or out and are putting pressure on the leads crew.
taz 6 switching back to original tool head,"hello 

i've been using my new moar struder and loving it! 



now i need to print some abs and i have switched back to the original tool head.

i re-flashed the firmware for the original tool head, is there anything else i need to do? when i switched to the moar struder i had to manually change the e-steps, do i need to reverse the process somehow? i do not see a sticker on the back of the original tool head with e-steps like there is on the moar struder.

thank you

v/r","thank you everyone for the help!

i conducted the extruder calibration and set it accordingly. i also found the documentation that gjg spoke of and it is called the ""evaluation and test document""  i am now making a binder to get all of my stuff together and i have put a little sticker on my tool head with the e-steps on it.  

i guess i do not understand how e-steps work, before calibration my e-steps were 816 and it was over extruding. after calibration the result was 830. i would think that you would reduce the number of e-steps for over extrusion. i'm just trying to wrap my head around the concept.

my next project is to make a tool head holder with a label showing the e-steps.

thank you!"
bearing play - is this normal?,"i was just looking over my new-ish taz 5, and reseating the extruder. in the process i noticed there is a fair amount of play in the x bearings. i'm including a video. is this normal?

https://vimeo.com/149034504

joe","i have some good news! some background first...

like many of us, i replace the stock plastic x & y bearings and soft steel shafts with misumi linear bearings and hardened steel shafts.  i was not satisfied with the results and had severe rippling on large horizontal surfaces of my parts.  the linear bearings rumbled and i figured it was resulting in harmonic vibrations that resulted in surface ripples. (seems this was true)

so, i ordered sintered bronze bearings from amazon (10mm id x 14mm od x 25mm l).  i printed some abs sleeves to place the bearings in to bring them up to size and just installed them on all three axes.  the results are amazing!  the ripples disappeared, the bed seems to move with less friction, and the printer is much quieter.  these new bronze bearings cost me only $50 with shipping.  another positive is that these bearings should work fine with the stock shafts - no hardened shafts necessary.  i'm expecting the bearings to last forever; a drop of oil every coupla months on each shaft (if that often) should do it.

the plastic sleeves are 2-part with a light press fit for the bearing.  the two parts overlap a bit and a drop of acetone cements them together.  see the photo of the plastic sleeves, the bronze bearing, and a bearing/sleeve assembly.

i can't describe how pleased (and relieved) i am with this upgrade."
taz 6 left side not lifting,"i've had my taz 6 for a while now, a little less than a year, and i'm now having a serious issue where the left side (facing the front of the printer) is no longer lifting. the stepper motor is working on that side, but it will not lift. the right side is lifting fine. it was making some loud/high pitch noises before this. any suggestions?","hi does the left side actually lift up and down on its own if moved up and down by hand?  if so, then amazingly you've threaded the nut!

other tthings to try:

(1) get a multimeter, disconnect each z motor, set it to resistance and check and compare the resistance across all combinations of wires  on the (not working) motor with the (working) z motor.

(2) connect the (not workng) z motor to the (working) x-axis or y-axis then using the cura 21 control just send ""move"" commands to test it out.

(3) likewise wire an x motor to the (not working) z motor stepper driver and test that too.

basically you want to narrow down where the fault is, ok?"
why changing taz 6 extruder?,"hi.

why people wants to change the taz 6 extruder by a e3d v6? is that because of the heat creep caused by the pla? is that the reason or there is more than that? 

thx.","the hexagon and the e3dv6 are very close to comparable in design. it is the opinion of some of us, myself included that the fluid plastic flow on the e3dv6 is a bit better, particularly on corners. the nozzles are interchangeable, so essentially a wash there, the e3dv6 has a bit more heat sink surface area, and more importantly a slightly tighter fillament path."
poor print quality,"i printed and the quality is very bad as shown below:

any ideas? the filament sticks to bed fine so not sure why?",can you post a video of your printer laying down the first layer? that would really help us diagnose what might be going on.
taz 6 probe failed clean nozzle errors,"so i was able to initially get some prints but now the machine constantly fails to print on probe failed clean noz errors. i cleaned all the parts of the nozzle, contact points, and print bed and even heated the end of the nozzle up to 200c to clear out old filament. any ideas how to get past this issue? i am very frustrated at how unreliable this printer is for the amount that i spent on it!","after homing the printer measure the right and left rod distance and make sure your x axis is level in relation to the bed surface. it may have become uneven, and if so the auto leveling routine can not adjust if too far out."
need help inserting new igus bushings,"i bought a taz 6 that was damaged and need to print a few new parts and am having trouble with the z carriage motor part. 

basically i can't get the two igus bushings to align properly when inserted so there is too much drag on the metal rod. 

i've printed the part several times and the parts seem to be printing well, though there is a little bit of bulge at the bottom of the part where the part meets the build plate.

are there any tricks or tips on getting these inserted / aligned? i wonder if lulzbot would just sell me the part before i use a whole roll of abs on printing parts.","when you say ""damaged"" what exactly do you mean?

do you mean for example ""the printer was dropped so that the frame was bent into a parallelogram""?

because the symptoms you're describing - two bearings binding to the z-rod - tend to suggest that the frame is bent into a parallelogram, when looked at from the front.

how is it possible to deduce that?

well, if the frame is bent into a left-to-right parallelogram then the z-rods will no longer be upright: they too, just like the frame sides will also be at an angle.

however...

the x-rods will still be dead level (horizontal).

meaning that whilst the z-holders are designed for a right-angle, the actual angle the z and x rods will be at will not be 90 degrees.

what that will do is cause the exact type of side-loading on the z-rod bearings that you are describing.

so.

first check that the frame sis actually ""true"".  you can do that very very easily by measuring across the two diagonals of each face,  try to get sub-millimetre accuracy on the measurements, as best you can.

so, let us know if the frame is properly square, ok?  it would also help to take photos of the frame and post them here so that the damage can be properly assessed."
anyone tried a removable pei bed?,"i have come to love pei. a well maintained and well cleaned/sanded pei sheet has unparalleled stick. 

recently i have been experimenting with other build plates such as geckotek. i love the idea of geckotek and its removable flexible plate but after the first few prints it loses its stick as the coating cures more. (i've been in contact with the creator brad and the plate is working as intended and he is also seeing the adhesion issues that i am experiencing. hopefully future versions will have the performance i need).

anyways, so i'm back to pei because i can obtain better stick. however i hate part removal of the pei. i make and sell a lot of costume props which are required to look perfect, thus i need perfect bed adhesion. this requires me to often ""over stick"" a part on the pei for large prints just so a corner doesnt warp slightly. 

this isnt the problem... the problem is when you go to remove the part (yes i use proper procedure, ipa soak, i take my time and the bed is set between 50-60c). but even with the best intentions and being careful, you still end up with bubbling of the pei sheet as it pulls. not a major issue but man is it annoying.

all this to say -> pei is the perfect build plate material except for its inability to stick well to its sub plate.

this brings me to my next idea. why bother with adhesion? has anyone tried to buy a 1/8"" or 1/4"" thick pei sheet and use it as a removable bed? there would be no bubbling as the bed doesn't need to be ""glued"" down.

anyone tried this? what would be the issues that you'd run into? flatness? i've never messed with pei in its raw form, i assume its pretty rigid? as in a 1/8"" sheet would not flex (i've seen people talk about scoring and snapping pei sheets). why are more people not doing this?","moejt wrote:i have come to love pei. a well maintained and well cleaned/sanded pei sheet has unparalleled stick.

just get a thicker sheet of pei. i use an 1/8 thick sheet, stuck down with 3m tape. never bubbles, still perfect 1 year later. i also use a 3/8"" wood chisel to pry parts off the bed, and it works phenomenally! the leverage works the part free, just keep the flat side up and use the bevel to slowly pop the part away. the glass will not break if you have a 1/8"" thick pei sheet!  i print with all materials, and this is the jackpot! !!!pro tip!!!

snapped the nozzle on my taz 5,"hi all,

i was attempting to clear a hips clog and managed to snap the nozzle off my tool head (first attempt doing so - in my frustration - i rushed it)   .

the problem is, the threaded part of the nozzle is still in the hot-end.

has this happened to anyone?

i don't think it spins freely due to there being some plastic holding it in place....if i were to soak the bottom in d-limonen would that work? i've never used it to dissolve hips, so i'm unsure if it leaves a residue...

any tips would be appreciated...

cheers","it has not actually happened to me(snapped nozzle) but i have removed quite a few broken off nozzle pieces.   

basic process:

heat to printing temp(240 or so - dependent on the plastic filament used before) then using a wrench to hold the heat block, press the proper sized screw extractor into the broken piece. back it out very carefully. it may take several attempts to loosen depending on how tight it was when it broke. i have made a extension cable so i can work on them laying flat on the heat bed. much easier that way to apply pressure than trying while in the tool head holder."
backlash,"i am seeing an effect in my prints that appears to be gear backlash, i.e. the print head does not go to exactly the same location when approaching from one direction as it does from the other.
the belts do not appear to be loose, nor do the pulleys or motors.
i looked in both cura and slic3r but did not find any adjustments for backlash.
backlash is going to exist in any open loop system such as the taz 6, how does one get rid of it?

attached is an example photo. you can see the inside surface shifts for a while at the same height as the mounting hole that caused the direction of the head to be reverse of what is was before and after the hole.","what you are seeing there isn't ne essarily backlash, though there is some of that present too. it's more likely either a slicing or minor over / under extrusion or possibly retraction issue. what happens with layers where the hole is present is that you have a segment with several, starts, stops and active vector changes that aren't present in the longer runs. each time you stop and start or change vectors on a marlin based 3d printer you are basically telling the printer ""go that way and accelerate at this speed until you stop"" meaning the print head essentially moves faster in the middle and slower at the ends before it stops. the layers with the integral hole are shorter runs. the 3d printer firmware and slicing programs know about this non constant motion issue, so they compensate for it. often newer firmwares and slicers use a linear advance variable to factor that in. 

what happens when you see a difference like that is either your slicer is a tiny bit off, or you have probably a small amount of over extrusion that only manifests itself on longer runs. you can experiment with dropping your fillament diameter a bit or changing e steps and fling calibration, etc. but even the best 3d printers will show that from time to time. 

backlash also comes into play, but with the taz 6 it's generally small enough you don't notice it unless you go looking for it or add something like a stronger more supported boxed rail. it shows up as slight  (like 0.01mm) offset every other layer usually, and is very hard to detect compared with extrusion inconsistencies between layers.  you also run into things like gravity offset and sideways rod sway due to slightly off center belt pull mounting on most printers. there are multiple ways to combat that, some of which like the anti backlash z nuts for the taz leadscrews literally cost an arm and a leg."
yet another taz5 enclosure,"i just wanted to share design if someone finds it usefull. i didn't like all those boxes that have holes for the vents for rambo, so i decided to disassemble the rambo from the frame and put it outside. having only two holes for the cables to go inside. its still work in progress as i havent fit the door yet and rambo is not bolted on to the frame..

frame is made out of 650mm alu extrusion profiles. connecting them together you get 650x690 - 4 sides and 690x690 - 2 sides. i have to make custom spool holder as the standard one is too wide. printer fits perfectly inside, without too much wasted space.
frame profiles are connected with standard l connectors. i used polycarbonate sheets. 4 sheets in black and 2 transparent (door and one side).









","i've had similar thoughts on an enclosure.  i've been mocking up something with cardboard to see how it might work out.  here's a corner bracket i made to move the lcd outside of the enclosure.  the lcd should probably be moved 5 or 6 more mm to the left in order to clear the panels better.  and, of course, it would require a couple of holes, or notches, in the side panel. i'm attaching the files in case they're of use to you.

removable taz 6 print surface,"i know this has been asked previously, but i have not found the answer. so here goes...

has anyone installed the printinz plate on their taz 6? if so, what modifications (outside of the corner washers) did you make?","i didn't use the build plate, i bought the removable skin, since it was cheaper and i could just clip it down. only problem i had then was that when the printer heats up it does tend to raise a bit in the middle, even though the edges are clipped down. thinking of getting double sided tape for that. getting prints off it is a cinch though! i love being able to gently pop a print off the bed."
dual extruder blobs with 1.75mm filament,"has anyone here ever had and solved this issue? i figure it has something to do with my retraction settings. it happens when the extruder switches from one nozzle to another.




anyone have recommendation on how to fix the problem?
support said the following:
this looks to be back-pressure due to the rate the filament is being fed. the extruder with the black filament also looks to be set too far down.","piercet wrote:you can print one, the files for the body are in devel.lulzbot.com, and you can buy an ""ao edition 1.75mm hexagon barrel"" kit. at that point you swap in the 1.75mm nozzle that you want, remove the barrel and guide tube from the 3.00mm hotrod and swap in the 1.75mm units, or just install the whole thing, and you are done. to fo a dual extruder you are probably looking at $120 in hotend parts

taz 6 z probing,"hey all

can someone throw a few suggestions as to why my bed probing vairies so much on one side. the bed readings

front left 7.1
front right 7.1 - 7.2
rear right 7.9
rear left unknown as the lcd goes to 15 as it goes to the front of the bed to begin the print.

as far as i can tell, the frame is square and doesn't look twisted forward. i have just finished doing the open rail mods on the y but hasn't changed the probe value. still has the .8 difference.",since changing to the open rail mod on y the probe levels are around the same but the print quality has improved. i am having no warping issues with abs (open frame) only thing i am not liking is the way print quality is when having to bridge over supports.
taz 6 broken extruder idler block (help!),"i had a tangle in the filament and it yanked pretty hard and broke the extrduer idler block right at the screw that holds it in place.

i glued it back together with super glue and started printing a replacement. the new part looks like a mess and before i risk going further here are the questions i should have asked before i started;

* what type of plastic is used for this part?
* what resolution is it printed at with cura?
* are there any special instructions or settings i need?

i started in abs plastic and maybe its cheap crap stuff but the part doesn't look anywhere near like the original.

thanks for you help!","kcchen_00 wrote:abs works best at 240-245c... 220c seems low.  but double check the filament manufacturer's recommended temp range.  usually there's a sticker with the range on the spool.

abs contracts when cooled too rapidly.  start with no fan and let the object cool on its own, at about 3mm or try a 40-50%.  stick with that for the rest of the print or go up to 70-80% max.  if the object is cooled too quickly the middle of the print may contract causing delamination (splitting) in the project.

a low extrusion temp may also lead to poor adhesion with the previous layer... again leading to splitting for taller prints.

hope that helps!  abs is a great material to stick with if you can figure out how to combat the warping and splitting.

this abs is from inland and its low side is 220. it really turns into a melted mess so the aggressive fan works well. but this is a small part so i image as i get bigger parts it will mess up and warp more.

i've gotten back up to the 110 bed and staying at the 220 extruder and the prints are flat and nicely smooth.

taz 6 dual extruder problems,"so i went through the online instructions twice and i am running into the following...

when i print my ""keychain"" sample after setup, it comes out fine.

when i go to print a new dual extrusion print, the rear hot end is touching the build plate and the front hot end is at proper height.  this problem causes the filament in the rear hot end to jam against the plate and the gear grinds into the filament.

no matter how many times i raise and lower the front hot end, the same problem occurs.

when i send it ""home"", the rear end barely touches the edge of the home button, and not the center of it.  then, when the heads clean against the cleaning pad, they move around considerably and do not appear to be centered on it.

can someone give me some guidance on these issues?

thanks!","well, the back extruder is set through the auto-level process.  so if its to low initially, the auto-level process is the problem.  check that the nozzles and discs are clean.  make sure that during the auto-level process, the bed does not deflect and the nozzle just touches the discs momentarily.  this will ensure the print plane is parallel to the bed.

if you've set a z-offsets in the lcd, try resetting.  calibrate the initial height of each nozzle individually.  print 2-3mm of a calibration cube using t0 and look at the bottom.  the extrusion pattern should dictate whether to adjust the offset.  once you're happy with t0, perform the same steps with t1.  btw, cura does a terrible job with trying to print with only one hotend.  instead of the z-offset, use the adjustment screw...


hope that helps... your issues seem related to the auto-level not creating the proper print plane."

taz 6 - i *think* it is a hardware problem? :),"this is a head scratcher. my prints have been going downhill recently. at first i just wrote it off to the cheap chinese filament i get off e-bay for $9 a roll. but then i bought some (theoretically) good stuff -- (esun + pla) and it actually got worse. 

i have rechecked all the basics, frame is square, extruding right, 20 mm cube does okay. i will get a good a print then a terrible print. 

(note at the very beginning of the video, the green part is cheap stuff and ok, the grey is the expensive the stuff. now the green would do this as well but it is getting worse every day. ) 



but now i am really stumped! one side of the print is good and the other side is bad! that strikes me as really weird!","yeah knowing how the print is sitting on the bed really narrows down where to look in terms of issues. it could be one of your leadscrews is loose. what happens with that is the setscrews in the upper or lower section of the coupler loosen but not enough that the leadscrew isn't still turning, just enough that it can slip over the duration of the print. auto leveling checks the start correctly, but as you go up layers, the left side gets a full turn to go up, the right side only turns 15/16ths of a turn. by the time you get to the top, one side is squished up. 

it could also be cooling. if you have one of the two cooling fans fail, you may only be recieveing part cooling on one side of the fillament. the symptom of that would usually be that the inside of the ""good"" section of the part would be messed up, while the inside section of the ""bad"" part of the part would match the quality of the good side.  other things could be point heat sources, like a computer sitting next to the bed blowing hot exhaust on one side of the part. it could also be related to lifting. if the heated bed has a partial failure, it could be that its not holding the pla on one side, and lifting due to contraction. pla is much, much less prone to that than abs, but it isn't out of the realm of the possible. 

it could also be model wierdness. it's unlikely since you are experiancing the issue on multiple parts, but if you want to pm me a link to that section of the cockpit if you don't want to post it, i can take a look at it and see if it slices odd for some reason. 

another possibility that you shouldn't be seeing yet is an electrical short in the motor, heater cartridge or thermistor lines. the symptom there are really really really hard to nail down, but what basically happens is that as the print head reaches full x maxiumum, it looses connectivity with the control box and cools down briefly, or looses one of the motor coil pairs and the print head looses force. that issue is usually intermittant, and it happened to me once, and i had a hell of a time trying to figure it out. 

it could also be gummed up bearings or other sort of glitch."
generic question - do you lube rails?,"so when i first got my printer i actually read may manual. as a man, i dont usually do that until something is very broken but that is how excited i was about printing!  

so it said to grease the threaded rods once per month and to just wipe down the solid guide bars- no lube needed.  so that is what i have done so far.  in fact, since it can be dusty here in texas i wipe the rods down far more often than that (no snickering!) 

then in another thread i saw the topic of sticky y bars come up so i just wondered, does anyone do anything more than wipe down the bars?

taz 6 strange noise while bed leveling,"hello all,

ever since i received my taz 6 there is a strange noise that it makes while bed leveling. when the print head moves down to touch the calibration points it makes a vibrating sound. initially i thought it is a normal sound, not being familiar with the printer but now i'm concerned as the box was very beaten up when i received the printer. is this normal or is there something wrong?

here is the video 



thanks!","yep, i know that noise!  

two things. 

1) move the x-bar almost all of the way to the top. then measure down from each side and make sure both sides are even from the top. just spin one of the threaded rods by hand until you get it perfect as possible. use this link then skip down to step 23.  
https://ohai.lulzbot.com/project/squari ... bulletins/
i use digital calipers and get it each side to within .01 mm or so each side but i am totally ocd/anal retentive!  

however- since your box was very beaten up when it arrived i think i would go through that whole process and check your frame!

as we know, cura varies fan speed as the print progresses or when minimum layer time has not been met. the issue is that at 24% fan speed (which i assumed was ramped up from 0%), the fans don’t have enough current to start spinning. this leads to a lack of cooling for the first few layers, which results in rough infill. i managed to start the fans by carefully pushing them to get them started, and they are now happily spinning at 24%.

has anyone else noticed this on their toolheads? it should be easy to test, simply set the fan to a low level and slowly ramp up to see at what point the fans spin.

a fix would be to “blip” the fans to 100% for a second to get them spinning, then the inertia will allow the fan assembly to continue rotating at low fan speeds. does marlin or cura have this feature? i found it in simplify3d but would rather have a good working out of box experience.","found the issue

taz 6 messing up layers,"hey guys

i recently got my first lulzbot and have been fiddling with the gcode perfecting every setting (i have previous experience with the prusa i3 and makerbot replicator 2x). now there is something i can't explain. for the first 6 layers, the tax prints flawlessly. like absolutely perfect and then the first layer after its done with the bottom layer of the box i am printing, the quality drops dramatically and the sides and insides start to get clumpy. ive slowed down the print, made the outer walls thicker, decreased infill density and overlap and it continues to print the same. i fixed it originally by decreasing the infill but then it started doing it again even though i didn't adjust the settings at all. ive cleaned the nozzle, disassembled the extruder and cleaned off every thing, sanded the bed with 1500grit to prevent warp thinking that might be a reason and nothing has fixed it. any suggestions? is it a code problem or a printer problem? thanks in advance","definitely too close at start, plus you are getting some lifting later. bump your bed temperature up 5 to 10 degrees. you also are getting inconsistent extrusion. while this can be temperature based, it's often idler arm tension. make sure you have about 7mm between the washers on either side of the idler arm springs.  also clean yhe hotbed bolt hobs. 

crap fillament will definitely impact printing. it would be a good idea to buy one roll of good stuff to learn with. lulzbot villiage plastic or push plastic 3.00mm abs works very well. 

you are getting the phenomenon known as elephants foot in addition to being too close to the bed. lulzbot stock profiles deliberately over extrude on the first layer to promote better bed adhesion. once you get everything else except that first 2 layers dialed in, you can experiment with dropping the initial layer extrusion percentage too."
taz 4/5 skipping steps?,"so. 

i've got a taz 4 with a metal hex hotend. i was getting great prints for a long time. now that i have been printing a lot (12 hours a day sometimes) more i've noticed there have been steps skipped. first it started in the y axis only. then started in the x also. and even sometimes it happens in the z axis. 

i have checked everything i can think of. belt tightness, turned down speed, turned down acceleration, jerk, etc.

i have been thinking that maybe i need to look into either a new power supply, or a new rambo board.

i've got one of the squeaky power supplies but it stopped squeaking and now the fan barely runs at all, but the machine operates. i should note the power supply has been weird pretty much since i got the unit. (bought it used)

anyway. i've looked into lowering power to the steppers as they get extremely hot during prints. i've tried swapping the motors, i've tried making sure the bearings slide smoothly on the axises. it's definitely not that. 

so, can someone tell me how to measure if a power supply is bad, and also how to check to see if my board is bad (i've read the stepper drivers sometimes need to be replaced)

please, help. this is a picture of my latest godawful print. note they are not always this bad but they have been slowly getting worse despite all my best efforts.


i'm losing my mind. 


ps:  tried later heights of .15, .2, .25. 

all types of infill, rectangular/concentric patterns, i've tried fast, slow, i've tried all the settings i can possibly change, it's definitely not just a print setting....","hello,

if you have the old peng chu (black plastic) psu. you will want to unplug it and then take the cover off and blow it out with canned air. 
then if the fan does not work better, please use a desk fan to blow at it, or it will smoke a capacitor in it.
here is a test for output:
if you have a digital multimeter available then plug the psu (power supply unit) into a worked outlet, and then measure the dc output of the 4 pins on the output of the psu. pins 1 and 3 will be ground, while pins 2 and 4 will be live. you should get +4/- 24v dc output when testing a live and ground pin. if this does not happen for each set of live pins, it will indicate the psu is failing.

make sure to check your pulleys on the x and y axis motors, for tight 1.27mm  allen set screws. make sure that one set screw is tight on the flat of the motor shaft, so that you don';t have the pulley slipping and shifting the model.

i hope this will help."
help trouble print head & fans after disassembly,"hi all, my taz 5 has been working great.  yesterday i noticed it starting to not print properly and on inspection i saw the idler carriage was broken.  i had a spare ready, so i pulled apart the print head, and also found a cracked main body with i also repaired.  i then put it all back together.  it seemed to go back togother reasonable easily.

but when i started to a print both the extruder end and part cooling fans are not working and also even though cura on my pc is saying the temps are 250 degrees (for abs) the head is hot but doesn't seem hot enough.  when i manually start pushing the filament though, it will extruder through but its quite hard to push it.

i have checked over what i can see but cant spot anything obvious.  has anyone got any ideas on how i could go about trouble shooting it?  i am reasonably handy with electronics etc.

any ideas most welcome!!","postscript, whilst typing the above post, the large part cooling fan has just come on?"
pei sheet replacement - best technique?,"hi all,  well love my taz, having built an enclosure for it, brilliant prints almost every time.

but for the second time, i need to replace my pei sheet due to bubbling.

so the first time i did it, i peeled the old one off (was a bit of a struggle) , used alcohol to clean of the glue then fitted the new sheet.  it was reasonable successful but i was wondering if anyone has come up with better ways?

1.  i have read putting the bed in the freezer first for an hour make sit easier to remove the old sheet is that correct?

2.  last time using the alcohol it was still a real pain in the butt to get rid of all the glue, is there a better solvent or technique to use?

3.  when refitting the sheet it was hard to get all the air out, are there any tips on how to do this the best way?

thanks in advance for any tips or tricks.","well having done this more than a few times myself, i have a few tips.

1. yes, do pop the bed in the freezer for about an hour. the old pei will come right off.

2. i wouldn't use any solvent other than alcohol. you don't want anything that could possibly leak onto the heater underneath the glass and cause any problems there. use alcohol and a scraper that has a razor blade or utility blade to remove the glue. it's messy and a pain, but it's the safest way to go.

3. when putting on the new sheet, don't pull all of the plastic cover off the adhesive. just peel up some plastic on one edge and position the pei sheet on one edge of the cleaned glass. get that edge down while bending the rest of the sheet up a little and start pressing or using something like a ruler to squeegee the air out. peel a little more plastic off as you go and press more air out. keep the unstuck pei flexed up away from the bed as you go and work down a few inches at a time. make sure you get as much air as you can before pressing the few inches of pei down. think of it as almost rolling it down like a carpet, but you want all the air out before it completely laid down.

4. when it comes time to replace it again, consider going with a thicker pei sheet. the last time i changed my pei, i decided to try a 40 mil sheet and i've been real happy with it. so far no bubbling and it is much tougher than the original pei. of course you will have to compensate for the increased bed height, depending on how thick the pei is.

anyone have an extruder stepper motor pin-out,"looking for a diagram for inserting the pins into a new harness for the extruder motor, the thermistor, and fans for swapping out tool heads. 

i have a few stepper motors, half height and the stock steppers, pin housings, a bunch of hexagons heater blocks, and a variety of nozzle sizes that ive printed up all the extruder assembly and mounting pieces for so i can change out nozzles by just removing the top hex head screw and disconnecting the wiring harness. i don't want to remove the pins from the stock extruder because the tension tabs get ruined and they are a pain to bend back so that they will grip on reinsertion. i know the logical step would be to pull back the heat shrink to see which colored wire goes to which pin socket, but i dont want to risk damaging the wires. does anyone have a pin out for the pin harness for connecting the thermistor, fans, heater, and extruder motor?","that's a more complicated question than it sounds on the face of it. the big question is, ""for which taz version?""

bubbles in pei sheet,"hey all

ive noticed large bubbles apearing on the bed of my taz 6 that went away when cool. until now they've been outside of where ive been printing but now have come up like ive shown in the picture.

the bed isnt that old, bought it in november as the kit on the lulzbot store. is there an easy way of replacing it? 




","yes, this has been a popular subject. no matter how careful you are the adhesive between the pei and glass will fail eventually from the heating and cooling. the higher the heat on the bed, the more prone to bubbling over time. i have been through many pei sheets and keep an extra bed assembly ready to roll when a working bed goes too bubbly to use. as an experiment, i have been running two identical printers, one with low heat bed filaments like ngen and one with high heat bed filaments like ht and xt. the high heat bed temps definitely bubble more than the low heat bed. so when i changed the high heat bed pei last time, i went with a 40 mil sheet of pei and that one shows no bubbling so far after a few months of constant daily printing. here's some links to find thicker pei sheets if you're interested.

uneven/shifted/missing layer issues,"looking for some fresh input here....

[what i know]

i've have great results printing with my new taz6 over the last several weeks.  recently, some issues have popped up.

my latest issue is that layers are printing uneven or shifted as shown in the attached image labeled bad_print.png.  additionally, and possibly directly related, is that when i zoom in on the part in s3d preview mode, i see a layer completely missing right at the height where my first process ends and the second begins.

[what i've done]

tighten belts: x and y belts felt a little loose so i tightened them up per the documented procedure
extruder calibration: extruded 100mm of filament at appropriate temp and speed and adjusted e-steps in firmware accordingly
filament diameter: measured filament diameter in several areas, averaged and noted the value
layer height calibration: printed 20x20x0.2mm calibration layer at 0.2mm resolution and adjusted z-offset in firmware accordingly
extrusion multiplier: printed 20x20x20mm cube with no top/bottom is vase mode with appropriate test parameters and arrived at extrusion multiplier
pid tuning: tuned my hot end and bed
s3d process settings: i input the values that i arrived at for filament diameter and extrusion multiplier

[of note]

i used a factory file from a friend who has a powerspec pro 2 printer as a starting point (we are printing the same parts).
after loading his factory file, i ran the s3d configuration assistant to change printers to my taz 6 with a single extruder.
rather than creating my own processes i simply edited those included in his factory file since we are printing the same part.

[question summary]

how do i correct the uneven/shifted layers?

how do i correct the missing layer issue?

what is the proper procedure for replicating non-printer-specific print settings from s3d processes that are tailored for printer models that are different from my own printer (as in the case where i am attempting to replicate settings for layer, additions, infill, and support)?

[attached supporting documentation]

s3d.zip (contains the above-mentioned .png images, images of all of my relevant process settings and my taz6_print.factory file - the object included in this file is not the actual object i am printing since that object is our own design and not meant for public distribution)

someone please save me; i'm tired.

-calfer","i will make a habit of paying more attention when viewing the build process in print preview mode.

yes....always spend some time looking at the layer preview mode and slicing through all the layers. a few minutes there can save you hours of having to reprint a part for an error you didn't catch!

you say when you use multiple process and have configured a non-standard first layer height that you don't change the the first layer height in subsequent processes.  would doing this not result in a noticeable layer size inconsistency in the first layer of each process as compared to adjacent printed layers on your part?

theoretically yes, but we're talking about 1 layer that is maybe .3mm thick vs all the other layers that are 0.2mm thick. one layer that is 0.1mm thicker at the start of a process i couldn't even notice. after all, a lot of what processes are used for is to speed up your print. we print very thin layers in areas with lots of curves or that needs lots of detail. we print thicker layers on vertical walls where details aren't important. basically, you are correct, but in actual application when you're looking at a part from half an arms length away, do you really notice a 0.1mm different for one layer? hardly....unless you're reeeeeeeally trying. if it does bother you, i explained above how to mathematically take care of it so subsequent processes don't have a thicker initial layer 


regarding the other items you pointed out:

1) while i did not create these processes, i can shed some light on why some settings were chosen.  the part we are printing is a connector that requires a high degree of strength and structural integrity.  we install these connectors with blunt force using a heavy hammer.  the shape is unique in that, for us being fairly new to 3d printing, it isn't readily apparent how to achieve the required level of strength without going overboard on layers and infill.

while infill does add some strength to a degree, what really adds your strength is the number of outside vertical walls or ""perimeter shells"" as simplify3d calls them. cura calls them ""shell thickness"". let's stick with s3d for now since that seems to be what you're using.

we want to increase the overall wall thickness. assuming you're using a standard taz 5 or 6, your nozzle diameter is probably 0.5mm. this is important to know when dealing with shells. each ""shell"" is one pass with the nozzle on the print. example: if you set the shells as ""2"" you'll have a 1mm vertical wall thickness. if you have 4 shells your vertical wall thickness will be 2mm = 0.5 * 4. adding more shells will thicken your vertical walls and add strength.

i've attached a couple of images of the model here.  there are some challenging angles that require strong walls.  would you have any advice as to how to how to achieve our strength goal with regard to applying uniform walls across angles like those in the model?  when we specify the number of perimeters are they applied uniformly to exterior angles of the elbow arms?

what you're missing here is the definition of ""top solid layers"" and ""bottom solid layers"". bottom solid layers are any horizontal or near horizontal layers on the bottom of the part not necessarily touching the build plate.

top solid layers are the opposite. layers that are horizontal or nearly horizontal on top of the part not necessarily the upper most layer and the subsequent layers before that. it's easier if i use some pictures:

if i tell s3d i want 10 solid bottom layers and 2 solid top layers, look at what i get in the print preview:






note that your ramped areas also have 10 solid bottom layers. (ignoring your initial layer thickness increase for simplicity of math) , i set my layer thickness to 0.2mm, there are 10 layers, 0.2mm *10 = 2mm, my bottom walls are 2mm thick uniformly.

now let's change my top layers from 2 layers as in the last picture and change them to 10 layers:






note that now all my top layers, even the angled ones, are 10 layers thick, or 2mm total wall thickness. great! however, notice my left and right vertical walls are still 2 shells thick. since our nozzle is 0.5mm wide, our vertical walls are only 0.5*2 = 1mm thick. boo! i want uniform thickness. since we agree that the top and bottom walls are 2mm thick each, we want the vertical walls the same thickness. the nozzle is 0.5mm wide so if we have 4 shells, 0.5mm x 4 = 2mm. what does that look like in s3d?






ah ha! now notice all outside walls are of uniform thickness. you should repeat these steps for 3mm wall thickness etc. this was all done in 1 process and does not require multiple processes.

angus over at maker's muse has a nice youtube video giving some part strength 101 on how to build tougher parts here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nzdr1yab8q

and, since there is a portion of the center cube that prints (~2.2mm) before the elbow arms begin to print, and say for example we specify 11 bottom layers and print with a 100% first layer height, am i correct to assume that there will only be one bottom layer applied to the elbow arms if we are using only one process?

hopefully my explanation above answers this question 


as you can surmise i am having difficulty grasping how to print a uniform shell across all angles of the model.

taking the above into account, what would your final advice be regarding our chosen infill percentage?

since this seems to be a small part, you could print this part with a uniform outer shell thickness and the standard 20% infill and print it again at 50% infill and try it out. most strength comes from the outer shell thickness. of course you said you're hammering these blocks. impact resistance is a function of the material too.

here is a chart that helps choose that material to use. note there is a line there for impact resistance:






tpu has the best impact resistance, but these are rubberized materials and not probably useful for your application. nylon is an extremely tough material, but it can be a little more challenging to print with and is hygroscopic so you have to keep it very dry or you'll need to put it in an oven to dry it out to be able to print with it. abs or pet are your best bets for these parts. polycarbonate is tough, but you have to print it at a very high temperature which can lead to other problems if you switch materials and you're not careful. pla is terrible for impacts, don't use it in this application.

i hope this helps! if you have any other questions, please don't hesitate you ask. i'm happy to help!

","did it come out of the box that way?

it couldn't hurt to ask lulzbot support for their advice. since it's brand new out of the box it's possible they might even just offer for you to send it back and they will send you another new one. but if your one who would rather just fix it themselves then there are probably a few things you can check and i'm sure others have come across this problem before and will chime in soon with their excellent help.

as for me i would suggest taking a look at the hot end thermistor as it's possible on of those hair-thin wires got broken or something. i'm guessing that a bad and/or unconnected thermistor would cause the same error message you are seeing but i'm not exactly sure.

the only other idea i have is that it is possible that the assembly people had a wire in the control box come unplugged when they did the final assembly. but i think that would be unlikely as i think they literally test them just before boxing them up. (plus opening up your electronics box i think officially voids your warranty), so either don't do that or (don't tell anyone you did). but again, i think that is an unlikely possibility. the thermistor is probably your problem somehow.."

wiring was a fun part of the build. i have myself an extra 10-15mm of length on the wires from the diagrams.

thanks again for the open design. it was one of the main reasons i pushed the company i work for to purchase a taz. we have had a stratasys dimension 1200 for many years now, but the yearly maintenance cost was only a few hundred less than the cost of a taz, and we were locked in to .010"" and .013"" layer thickness, and very expensive print cartridges of only abs. so we stopped the maintenance contract (rarely needed it anyway) and got the taz instead. having the 3d design files of the taz available was a big plus.

we still use the dimension, since it is very easy to use and the support material system works very well, but the taz is slowly getting more features than the dimension, and it is much cheaper to run."

new wiring harness with compatible v2c connector.  check!

now is where it gets tricky because i need a hot end with the v2c and i have to also wire in a stepper motor to that connector also.  
the standalone hot end does not appear to have the v2c option. 
https://www.lulzbot.com/store/parts/lul ... on-hot-end
are the pinouts of the v2c posted somewhere?  
what about crimp pins to adapt the stepper motor harness to the v2c?","the pinout and assembly instructions are available here in step 11: https://ohai.lulzbot.com/project/taz-6- ... bly/taz-6/  the pins will be listed in one of the bill of materials files with an ods extension available here http://devel.lulzbot.com/taz/accessories/tilapia/ 

the ods files can be opened by microsoft excel. it looks like they contain the whole part set for the entire taz though. just digging around quickly it looks like the parts you need are going to be these: 

revb stepper motor jst 115mm harness (el-hr0096) - that's the housing for sure
[el-ms0014] noninsulated wire ferrule, 16 awg, .28"" pin length - i think these are the blanking pins for allignment
[el-ms0205] molex-conn term male 22-24awg tin - reels of 20k - these may be the crimp pins 
[el-ms0251] conn housing 16pos .100 dual - this may be the opposite side
[el-ms0351] jst - conn term crimp ph 24-30awg - 8,000 unit reel - these may be the other side pins or something else? 
[el-ms0355] conn housing ph 6pos 2mm white - no idea what this is
digikey should have those parts available. 

i've never actually made the 6 style harness. i don't like the lack of a locking latch. i will admit it looks better than the older ones, but i prefer the secure connection personally. i've not tried it though either so it may be a much firmer connection than i am thinking it is."
is it leveled?,"hey guys
i'm having some troubles with the bed leveling on my printer or so i think. i printed the bed calibration code and it looks to me fine (but i can be wrong!!! still a noob). after i ran the bed calibration i printed the octopus on the sd card and i consider it came out beautifully. removed the print from the bed and proceeded to print some parts i need and all hell broke loose with the print and some of the parts lifted from the bed as you can see on the pictures. so is my printer leveled and it might be another problem or i still need to work with leveling","it's hard to say other than it looks like your extruder temperature is very high.
your printer is more than likely not a taz6 because there is only 1 fan blowing on the filament.
so
i think you will get some responses if you provide the following information.
printer make and model
slicing software
extruder temperature
bed temperature

with that said
the only time i've seen this type of thing on my taz6 was after running about 500grams of abs material with the fan
turned off, i switched over to ngen material and made sure my extruder was very clean.
when i started the ngen, i did not realize there was a buildup of abs filament dust that had accumulated in my fan housings.
when the fans kicked in the accumulated dust was blown out and deposited on my ngen print and on the extruder.
then the ngen got stuck on the extruder tip because of the melted abs dust.
the end result looked a lot like your photos.
just a thought.

the 1st layer of you print looks very melted from your photo.
that's about it for what i know.
i'm thinking others will chime in if you provide the info i asked for above."

what i've done so far:
measured filament in several places and averaged.
lowered first layer extrusion. 
calibrated extruder steps. 100m dead on.

you set this on the machine itself, configuration > advanced settings > z offset.  i usually start up a print of the fish fossilz keychain (found below) and adjust as it's printing the first layer.  goal is to get it to fill in each section properly, but don't squish to much that the sections connect.  cancel after the first layer then try again if it's not dialed in by the time it starts on the second layer.

"taz6 x-axis jump, cura beta to blame?","was just printing up a set of hair clipper guards for a friend, and thought i'd play around with the cura beta for the new infills.  i selected pla, high detail, and ported the machine settings over from lulzbot cura.  it was working pretty great, but i noticed there was a small jump on the x axis.  it didn't seem to be the straightest jump in the world (second picture is a straight on shot of one of the fork tines removed), but it lasted several layers and the print settled out after that, which led me to believe the cura settings might have just been moving too fast for the motors to keep up.  looking at the profile, it looks like it was set to are these flaws in line with that assumption, or is there something else i should be looking into here?  the print is otherwise very good.

i have attached the mesh, gcode and cura project file for perusal.","looks like an axis shift. check the x and y axis. if the pulleys have loosened at all the axis can shift when the pulley slips around the motor shaft. you can do this by homing each axis then with the motors still locked gently try to move the axis. if you have a loose pulley, tighten it up making sure that one of the set screws is on the flat cut in the motor shaft.

extrusion delay - taz 6,"hi all,

i'm new to 3d printing.  i've dedicated many hours of reading and, as a result, have a good understanding of printer anatomy, associated terminology and slicer settings.

my taz 6 worked well right out of the box.  i've got a couple hundred hours on it with no problems.  recently i started having first layer issues.  before going nuts changing parameters in the printer, slicer, etc., i figured i'd better calibrate everything and proceed from there.

so, i've been following this write-up:

https://www.3dhubs.com/talk/thread/howt ... d-filament

i've completed steps 1-4.

during the printing portions of the steps in the write-up and during most all of my prints with this printer i notice that there is a long delay between when the tool head begins following the print path and when plastic starts to extrude.  in a few rare cases filament never began to extrude so i cancelled those prints within the first minute or so.  this isn't so much an issue when printing a large skirt or brim as the hotend will eventually prime itself and begin to extrude.  but, on smaller prints such as the temperature calibration towers in step 5 of the write-up, the issue becomes more pronounced since filament is not being extruded once the actual model begins to be printed.

is it possible this issue is related to excessive retraction during the beginning of the bed calibration sequence, possibly adding to the time it takes to pull filament back into the hotend and, subsequently, delaying extrusion?

would love to get some input on this.

-calfer","this was discussed here: viewtopic.php?f=29&t=5976

i've had the best luck with changing my starting gcode, here is my text from that thread:

""i started having the same issue with my taz6 so i just tweaked the starting code a tad at the end.

i replaced:

g1 z2 e0 f75 ; extrude filament back into nozzle

with

g1 z2 e5 f75 ; extrude filament back into nozzle < changed this so it pushes back an extra 5mm
g92 e0 ; set extruder position to 0 < added this to reset extruder so it doesn't try and go back 5mm'ish to start first layer

what i think is happening is the ending script is retracting the filament 6mm:

g1 e-1 f300 ; retract the filament a bit before lifting the nozzle, to release some of the pressure
g1 z+20 e-5 x-20 y-20 f3000 ; move z up a bit and retract filament even more

then when you start a new print it resets the absolute position to zero, retracts 30mm for cleaning/leveling, then returns back to 0 before printing, but that doesn't compensate for 6mm retraction at the end of the previous print."""
chrysalis: aluminum-framed enclosure for taz 6,"after encountering some warping issues on my taz 6, i designed and built an enclosure to help keep the environment consistent. the electronics is outside of the enclosure and it fits the outside of the taz 6 like a glove. there are cutouts for all the protrusions on the frame including screws and the spool holder system. i've got two fan mounts for adding ventilation later and i've also got a couple of mount points for adding a spool holder on top if i want it.





















the whole enclosure is designed in two sections to allow easy portability and so that i can remove the front if i need to get at the workings of the machine. there are also easily removable cutouts that provide handles on the enclosure for ease of transport. a large latched door is made of acrylic and there are two windows on top to allow light and visibility. but otherwise the outside is made of abs connected together by v-slot and makerlink.






i've got full details of the build including design files and assembly instructions at the project page at: http://tenrec.builders/chrysalis/

i've also got the materials for a few extra enclosures, so if you want a kit of it that is ready to go, you can get one: https://store.diybookscanner.org/produc ... -enclosure

feel free to ask me any questions about the design. or if you notice an inconsistency in the documentation or a way to improve the build, i'd love to hear about it.

""out of curiosity, have you actually seen prints warp after the printing process is over? you take a lot of care with cooling post-print and it never occurred to me to do so. the only times i've noticed warping was mid-print and so whenever parts are done, i have just popped them off and started using them without worrying about cooling any more.""
..
to answer your question concerning warping after the printing process;
when i first started 3d printing for myself, i almost gave up on abs.
i understood that abs shrinks quite a bit because of my experience with vacuum forming abs.
when vacuum forming, you need to get the parts off the tooling before it gets to cool, but not while it's too hot.
after the vacuum formed part is removed from the tool and allowed to cool to room temperature, it will not fit back on the tool.
the shrinkage is quite large.
..
usually long parts, say about 200mm long will tend to warp if removed from the build plate while warm.
i've also had parts that were thin wall (say about 1mm thick wall) and over about 50mm tall crack after they are cool but are not cool when removed from the build plate.
when i use the paper towels in an attempt at removing the temperature gradients in the part before the part is too cool, most of my prints do not warp, crack or break mysteriously a few days after i've printed them.
..
the general idea is to attempt to get the entire 3d printed part to the temperature that the build plate is at.
then allow the part to cool slowly.
this equalizes the internal stresses in the part.
at least that's what i've come to believe.
..
sorry about my long winded post, but it's a topic i wish i would hear more about.
..
thanks again for your enclosure temperature info.

removing a stuck print,"hi
i tried to find the message thread concerning removing a stuck part from the print bed.
i could not find the message thread but
..
someone suggested tapping on the stuck print with something like a screwdriver handle or some such thing.
the parts on my taz6 are sticking quite a lot, even though my pei surface is cleaned regularly and lately i've been applying glue stick.
i'm currently printing with matter hackers transparent abs material.
i purchased the matter hackers filament because i could not find it on the lulzbot site where i usually purchase my filament from.
i like the glue stick because it gets my parts slightly above the pei surface so i have some chance of not damaging it when removing parts.
..
i use the standard clam opening tool supplied in the maintenance kit from when i purchased my taz6 last september.
..
today, i needed to remove some dome shaped parts that are very particular that the surface contacting the bed is not damaged.
i designed a small 1mm tall extension into the part that would be very easy to trim.
i slipped my clam opening tool under my extension and applied quite a bit of tension, hoping to break the bond.
the part was absolutely stuck and no manner of pressure i could apply to the clam shell tool would release the part.
then
i thought about the guy that suggested tapping gently on the part with something like a screw driver handle!
..
with as much pressure as i could generate with the clam shell tool, i grabbed a small screw driver and gave the part a gentle tap.
the end result made me smile!
the part flew under my paper towel insulator and was completely free from the build platform.
..
it was exactly the same result as removing the primary sprocket from my knucklehead harley!
..
so:
thanks to whoever you are that made that comment.

and thanks again
gary","hi john
i started using the glue stick on the pei surface after i started noticing residue from the print on the pei.
when i use the glue stick, i never get any residue and being that the glue stick is applied to the top of the pei,
the glue bonds to the pei and the prints bond to the glue.
when i wash the glue off after maybe 10 or 15 prints, i get no residue marks on the pei.
my thought is that maybe the pei surface will last longer.
i suppose i'll find out when my pei gets bubbles in hopefully a number of years or never.

how do i print from t1 with t0 support structures,"hi,

i have a flexydually and i would like to print the main object with t1 (ninjaflex) and have t0 (abs) become the support structure. does anyone have any pointers as to how i might be able to do this?

cura doesn't seem to work and tries to print from t0 with t1 supports.

thanks!","i recently purchased a dual extruder and a flexy dually. i've used both for some simple tests, but haven't tried a model that needed support material yet. warning: below is just an idea (not tested by me yet..)

i am assuming you already tried the drop down in cura ""support dual extrusion"" on basic tab and specified to use the first extruder for support. perhaps at this point it used the rear extruder for everything (support and model.) is that correct? 

the order you click stl's for ""dual extrusion merge"" controls which extruder is used for each stl. so, if the support could be a separate stl, then this would be another way to control which extruder is used for model. but it is probably more convenient to use cura for generating the supports. so i have one more idea.

if cura must generate supports.. first, use dual extrusion merge to combine your model with a throw-away model, perhaps a small cube. click the small cube first (for back extruder) then right click your flex model and merge. if the coordinates of the cube are right, they would be ""merged"" but still not actually overlap. this order of clicking would tell cura that your real, flex model should be on second extruder. then, select the drop down in cura ""support dual extrusion"" on basic tab and specify to use only the first extruder for support. (so the first extruder would do support as well as the separate throw-away cube..)

aside: i did earlier do a flex only print, no supports, by manually editing the gcode to switch the extruder activation near the top of the file. i shut off the rear extruder and printed flex only. it printed 50mm forward on the build plate compared to where it ""thinks"" it is printing, but it worked okay. my backup plan was something like the above idea with a throw-away model which i didn't test yet. since you actually do need both materials, i would not try modifying gcode.. offsets would be tricky, etc.. but combining the dual merge order with the drop down to choose your support material should work if my understanding is correct."
what does z-offset do?,"hi all,

i just got my taz6 and i'm trying to fix a bulge on the lowest few layers. the calibration instructions for the z-offset says to print the calibration octopus and measure the thickness of the skirt and adjust the z-offset until it is 0.325-0.45mm. mine is about 0.35mm no matter how i change the z-offset. the factory setting was -1.2 and i've tried anything between -1.1 and -1.4 and it has absolutely no effect on the skirt thickness. am i misunderstanding how this should work?

edit: there is also another thing i don't understand: the auto-leveling doesn't seem to work. the z-values it spits out are very repeatable, and i've verified that they are correct by running the nozzle over the pads after power-up, without running a auto-level. however, if i, after the auto-level has completed, cancel the job and run the head over to next to the pads, the actual height varies substantially. for example, if i run to z=0.25, the head is 0.20mm above at the plate by the x-y- pad, but 0.43mm above by the x+y- one. i'd assume a constant offset here could be the z-offset, but the fact that the head height differs near the different pads must mean the auto level didn't work correctly. i've verified that the pads are clean and have no debris between them and the plate.

if i power up the taz connected to cura, one of the things it prints is
code: select all< echo:eqn coefficients:
< echo:a: -0.000234 b: 0.000057 d: 1.838720

does this mean that there is some auto-level information pre-programmed from the factory? this is not at all what i get when i run the auto-level myself. (i get basically the same magnitudes but opposite signs on a and b.)

more edit: i found it is possible to set the equation coefficients manually using g27. if i do this, i can take out the offset between the x-y- and x+y- pads by setting the a-value to -height_difference/280, and same for the x-y+ pad and the b-value. the problem seems to be that these values overcompensate the x+y+ pad, which means the plate is not a plane, it's twisted. since we have four data points it seems it would be better to, rather than fitting a plane, linearly interpolate between the four points. that way it would also account for twist.

even more edits: it appears that marlin can do a mesh-based bed interpolation, judging by https://github.com/marlinfirmware/marli ... n_main.cpp. the marlin at http://devel.lulzbot.com/taz/olive/soft ... n_main.cpp, however, does not seem to have that option. is the taz using a forked marlin that does not have these features?","auto level on the taz doe not actually move your bed to level it. it's more like a ""virtual"" auto-leveling: it probes the 4 corners and measures each height, then calculates what the bed heights should be across the printbed, and applies a correction factor to the print head as it moves across the bed.

if you are finding the 2 left side heights are significantly different from the right side heights, that's an indication that the 2 z-axis lead screws are out of whack. (for example, if the screw on one end got cranked up a bit in relation to the other. this lifts one end of the x-carriage up in relation to the other - making more work for your taz to apply a larger auto-level correction.

yuo could try searching this forum for ""x carriage alignment"" or something similar to figure out how to correct this."
12 mm rod upgrade for taz,has anyone yet attempted a 12 mm rod upgrade for the x and/or y axis of the taz 4 or 5?  am i correct in understanding the x axis on the taz 6 are 12 mm rods?  if there are some modded files out there for this upgrade please share.,"someone already beat me to that. billyd has a mod that will fit a stock taz 4/5 on x, though you will have to drill out the rod holes in the end plate to fit it (not a big deal) http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1392011 

as an added bonus, my anti-wobble will fit that design. 

the taz 6 axis and carriage is also usable, and the part files or even the parts themselves are open source and available. the trick with them is that you are basically committed to going with auto bed leveling if you go that route, since there is no z endstop target mount on the taz 6 parts. you can get a bed plate and the parts needed to convert for around $70 or so from itworks3d.com though. that also includes the need to swap out the idler mount to get the front y axis limit switch mount location."
"help with filament ""stalling""","hi all, have had my taz now for probably close to a year.  basically i am very happy, when it prints properley its awesome.

but....

i am not sure if i am doing something wrong.  quite often, when printing, at some point during the print, sometimes early on, sometimes later the filament ""stalls"" for want of a better word in the drive head, and basically the drive shaft eats a notch in the filament stopping it printing.

i have had this happen on pla and abs.  i have thought the issue is the tension on the drive roller, i basically screw it down until the threads slightly protrude out of the back of the head.

when it happens, i remove the filament, and carefully clean out any material trapped in the grooves of the drive roller and start again.

so has anyone else had this problem, and any suggestions on what i may be doing wrong, or what to try?

thanks in advance.



","there is another way this happens. assuming your idler clamp is set correctly, this also can happen from back pressure caused from your nozzle being not set to the correct height + incorrect flow rate %

here's how you confirm that you have this correct:

1. print a test cube with a skirt of maybe 3-4 skirt diameters. peel off the skirt and use calipers and measure the skirt thickness. if you're using cura standard profiles, your initial layer thickness should be set for 0.425mm. when you measure your skirt thickness with calipers, does your skirt measure 0.425 exactly? if not, you need you adjust your z-height until cura matches what you're getting in real life

2. post a picture of the bottom of one of your parts. that's an easy way to tell if your flow rate/nozzle height is correct. if you can confirm your first layer thickness matches your initial layer thickness in cura, print a cube and look at the bottom of the print. are all the print lines mashed together there it is hard to discern individual passes of the nozzle? if so, your flow rate is too high. reduce your flow % and try again (this assumes you've already measured your filament diameter with calipers and entered that actual diameter into cura).


i had this exact failure printing with xt (abs-like  material) i had another person who had this failure using pla. both were caused by nozzle height problems and overextrusion.

what happens is cura thinks your nozzle is at a height of 0.425 and is using a specific filament diameter. it's going to push out a volume of dilament to fill that calculated area. if your flow rate is high and your nozzle is closer to the bed than it expects, it's going to try its hardest to push the same amount of material out. this causes back pressure in the tool head and the hobbed bolt shears the material because it physically can't push any more material out because the nozzle is effectively blocked because too much material is being requested to be pushed out of the print head vs. how much space is actually available.


since this is happening with abs and pla. i'm 99% sure this is your issue. please report back with what your skirt thickness measures on the test print and send a picture or two of the bottom surface of your last few prints that failed.

thanks

nozzle change 0.3mm settings/firmware?,i recently purchased a 0.3mm nozzle for use with 3mm filament to use on my taz5.  i am using cura for printing.  i setup a second machine profile for this just to make switching easy but saw they don't have a choice of 0.3mm nozzle.  the only choices are 0.5 or 0.35. what do i need to change in order to use the 0.3mm nozzle besides the nozzle size setting.  is there a firmware change?  any other settings to change?,"the nozzle size setting is the main one. you may also want to adjust your layer height. a 0.35mm nozzle is going to lay down a bit more plastic than a 0.3mm one, so it will do a bit better with a bit thicker layer. you may want to lower your layer setting a bit, but still try to pick a layer height divisible by 5 (i think? its been a while since i played with a 0.3mm nozzle, if you get it wrong, you may see excessive z wobble banding, if changing the number slightly makes it go away, you know you had the wrong one)

does anyone have any experience with this or recommendations?","my taz5 sits on a hardwood butcher block work table that weighs a ton. the printer sits directly on the wood surface and it's plenty stiff.


the overkill enclosure i'm building is made out of t channel aluminum and plexiglas. the enclosure also sits on the table (around the edges) and has an open bottom. my inspiration to use aluminum and plexiglas came from here - http://imgur.com/a/o3h5r
designing and building it was more fun than my first erector set!

i wouldn't attach my printer to the enclosure. i think it would be very noisy. the enclosure would resonate with the song of the stepper motors. one benefit of the enclosure is to dampen the noise. i used rubber gaskets to secure the plexiglas panels in the aluminum frame, but still think it would amplify the noise in my setup. it would also be harder to access the printer if you want to do any fixing or modifications. you would have to detach the printer from the enclosure before you could work on it.

the electronics box definitely needs to either be outside of the enclosure or have access to fresh, cool air. i designed and printed a small duct that penetrates through the plexiglas and mates to the electronics box. on the taz5, both the intake and exhaust happen on this side so all is well. you can see my duct project here - viewtopic.php?f=36&t=6155

i should be able to share my completed project in a week or so.

dual toolhead based on flexion extruders,"just letting people know i posted a design for a dual extruder based on the flexion extruders.  i intend to use it for all combinations of flexible and inflexible materials.

its working really well.  the very first print is attached after setting the e-steps and calibration cubes

i used orange ninjaflex and e3d edge as they were the only 1.75mm materials i had on hand.

bill","donute,

thank you for your input. yes, i am following your build first. i did make an alternative stabilizer because of how it was printing out, but inevitably ended back with your design as using a different version doesn't allow the fan shroud to fit. 

as for dual extruder familiarity, i already have a davinci duo, so i am at least already familiar with the software/design side of it.

for me i am building this extruder for three reasons:
     1) so i am more comfortable with the components in an extruder. 
     2) because those that have built this seem to have had good luck with improve printing quality as well as faster and higher quality flexible materials.
     3) because i was looking at flexy dually v. dual extruder from lb and didn't want to have to buy two different assemblies. this should address both of them for 1 price.


following your instructions, it appears in a few places you used different size fasteners that i did (or at least what you have listed on your build) 

as for positioning, i am using a 3d printed l-bracket first (until my order from misumi is ready) to do a dry fit.  there are a few areas where i have to be sure i have it positioned correctly, it also will help with routing of wiring and such. i am taking this build slowly and methodically, but still the warnings are appreciated. 

right now i am waiting on the l-bracket and a second harness connector which was out of stock.

buyer beware,"ladies and gents,

i am the proud owner of a lulzbot mini and, very soon, a taz 6. i would like to caution anyone who may be thinking of buying one of these to please, for the love of whatever you hold dear, do not buy them from amazon wholesale (scratch and dent). i made this mistake and ended up getting a refurbished model that was not correctly refurbished. it was not refurbed by ao or even it works 3d, but by some chimpanzee at amazon. i received this printer in the following condition:
-missing screws.
-an unsupported rambo or knockoff thereof.
-bubbles in the pei sheet.
-pva glue still on the pei.
-poorly packed
-y axis non-functional (found to be probably because of the unsupported rambo clone.)

the unit i was sold was supposed to only have minor (>5%) cosmetic defects. figured scratched paint isn't a big deal. i didn't count on sam's discount vcr shop doing a refurb and that being what i get. but it's what i got.

all in all it was a very poor experience. i will only be buying from ao/lulz from now on, because i know i can count on the excellent customer service, as i received from david who helped me determine what the issues were. 

my new taz is on order from ao and will hopefully be here shortly, as i can't wait to start printing with it.

-gully","it looks like in the near future we'll be able to handle all of the amazon returns, so they won't do refurbs at all. so that way we know we can get them refurbed correctly.

thanks!

taz 4 z axis not lowering,"i've recently purchased a taz 4 from an acquaintance.  at the time of purchase, everything was working fine.

i'm pretty much completely new to this end of 3d printing. (ie i've prepared lots of models and had them printed, but never used the hardware myself) so i'm pretty much lost in the woods on this. 

since stuff shifted during transportation, i've been trying to set the home position using printrun with pronterface.

the x and y axis works fine. the z axis would not lower below the point it was set at when i received it, about 6"" above the bed. when trying to home z, it moves to this point and begins humming loudly until the machine is shut off. manual movements in printrun will go to this point and stop, without the humming. 

manual movements in printrun will move up, and then back down without issues, just not beyond this point.

i read a post about similar problems http://forum.lulzbot.com/viewtopic.php?t=1548 and followed this advice.
from the new bottom position there, i could manually move up and down with printrun without issues, but once i attempted to home the z axis, the exact same problem arose. 

these same problems arise when using the glcd, so i don't think printrun is to blame.

as far as i know, there was no damage in transporting the printer, and everything moved fine when i turned the rods by hand, so i don't' think its a bind in the hardware. 

any ideas on how to fix this?","it may be a loose or disconnected endstop wire or a loose z motor wire. check the fittings at all connection points and the board using the ohai kit pictures as guidelines for reference. it shouldn't be a fuse because the x and y wouldn't be working.

it could also be the com port speed value in printrun but since the lcd isn't working right either that's unlikely.  

also check the x axis for level. measure from the. top of the bottom z motor mount leadscrew ball bearing to the underside of the leadscrew nut. that distance should be identical on both sides. if it is off, the z motion can bind.

a longshot, but also check the couple setscrews on both sides.

there are red shipping clamps that may be in place on the z rods that need to be removed before use, check to see if those got reinstalled."
*warning* anyone with a thermal runaway issue,"well, i am sure this is one in a million but i had thermal runaway error pop up while i was printing with my taz 6. after checking everything with multimeter, we found the problem...
please check your board if something like this happens.","when i've encountered melted connectors like that, usually it's due to a bad connection getting resistive and causing it to heat up.
check the wire entry and be sure the screw is tight.  check the board solder joint and be sure it isn't cracked around the pin.

if you pull the wire from the connector by loosening the screw, is it tinned?  it should not be.  best is crimp ferrules, otherwise good clean bare wire.

that looks somewhat like a weidmuller connector.  digikey shows a rating of 12a for one style.  any idea how much current you were flowing?"
problem with y-axis belt mount,"so my y-axis belt mount basically fell off today. all four of the thermal inserts have come out of the mount and it is just dangling. brilliant me didn't print off a spare mount either. so i am going to try to wedge it back on long enough to get a spare printed. my question is where would i look to find some of the thermal inserts that i am going to need to attach it to the bottom of the y-plate?

also, has this happened to anyone before? i assume making another y-mount is what i am going to need to do, but any other suggestions are welcome

[solved] extruder motor not turning,"i'm designing a toolhead for a bondtech extruder and e3d v6 and am half there.

everything is done and connected but for some reason the motor won't turn. it's this motor:
shop.bondtech.se/shop/ws71/47371/art76/30163976-8f5054-nema17_planetary_geared_steppermotor.pdf

i looked at the lulzbot motor datasheet specified in their bom:
http://download.lulzbot.com/ao-100/hard ... motors.pdf

i was hoping that the motor would just be a drop in replacement but it seems that i'm missing something here. i can hear the motor driver whine but the motor doesn't turn. i've swapped the wires to the harness and still nothing. i know the motor is good because when i connect it to another board of mine, it does rotate and the harness is still good because when i connect the old toolhead, the motor on that one turns.

my only thought left is that perhaps this motor needs more juice to turn, but looking at the datasheets, that doesn't seem to be the case.

does anyone have any ideas?



solved- turns out i just needed to switch the motor wires around to find the correct combo - ie map correctly from the 2 datasheets.","the bondtech is fantastic... isn't it!

remember that the motor is geared down in its own right, rather than most extruders that gear down separately... so it takes 5 ""clicks"" to advance the equivalent of a standard setups 1 ""click""... so it can appear not to move but really it is doing so.

i assume you are testing the motor unmounted and not bolted to the extruder... its the only way to check its the motor not the complete unit.

have you tried removing the gearbox from the motor? and checking the motor on its own

other uses for a taz,"this might well sound daft... but then i'm laid-up and ""daft"" is the current type of thoughts....

what i'm wondering is..... has anybody tried using the taz as a cnc drill or router?

the line of thought is... 
nylon sticks best to tufnol (garolite in usa).. the cotton woven type called whale in tufnol.. not the paper bonded types....  
but tufnol / garolite is never flat (its an impossibility due to the way phenol formaldehyde bonded fabric composite is made).. 
but you need a flat surface to form a good base layer in 3d printing.....
so.... what if the surface is levelled by a cnc router or sander whilst in position on he levelling bed...

as i said ""sounds daft""... now i'll go away and take some more magic pills...

btw did you know that garolite / tufnol is the same material used in east germany to make trabant cars.... no wonder they were smelly and didn't rust","you can make sure mill frame or a cutting laser out of a taz, but dust and shavings from a milling process is the enemy of bed adhesion. and lasers need "" don't melt my eye"" enclosures for safety."
taz 6 frame squaring,"i have an early taz 6 that was affected by the issue where the printers frame might have gotten out of square while shipping. i have tried to square the frame according to these instructions: https://ohai.lulzbot.com/project/squari ... bulletins/ but i can't get the diagonal measurement to be equal. i always get 74.5 and 75.5cm if i put the extrusions flush on the bottom. just by looking at the frame visually it looks a bit out of square.

 i tried to measure the angle between the x and z-axis smooth rods with a digital angle gauge and it shows that i'm 0.4° off. i don't think that is much to worry about but now i got a small print that was about 3.2° out of square for some reason. on the print the angle between z and x-axis |_  was 87°. the smooth rods |_ were 89.6°. measuring the aluminium extrusions i get the same ?0.5° off.

y-z-plane was bang on within 0.1°.","i needed to revise my elementary school geometry. as the layers stayed perfectly level, the frame was a perfect parallelogram.
i did the frame squaring once more but now i had a friend tweaking the frame while i tightened the screws. i got it to measure 748mm all around. hopefully this issue is now fixed. i'm printing the test cube once more and i'm quite confident i'm going to be pleased with it."
new taz 5 modification path,"i have now had my taz 5 for about 5 days, prints just fine, granted my printerbot simple currently can print better, but thats because i have perfect kisslicer profiles for it and it is extremely well tuned.  that will change.  i am starting this thread because i like to design parts, if i think i can make something better i will try, i will also share my files if others are interested.

so far i have ordered all of the supplies to do the openbeam x axis, the design of that axis is atrocious.  press in bearings not properly constrained, i was extremely disappointed to find that in a 2200$ product.  the y axis seams better, the bearings look like they might actually be pressed in.  the x axis currently has play, the y is not measurable ""by hand.""
these parts will be printed in alloy 910.

after the x axis my next step is to replace all fans and i mean all of them with quieter fans.  the control box will get a buck converter and be always on when printer is on.  i believe the power supply is a drop in replacement.  i will use 2 40mm fans in series for extrusion cooling.  and the 5v hot end fan will be replaced by a 5v 40mm fan.  i do not see any fan shrouds that i like currently that do what i want, so i expect to once again design another fan shroud.  (ive done this at least a dozen times for different printers/extruders)

next im thinking y axis open beam.



is there any modifications that i am forgetting completely that are almost necessary?","i decided to experiment with a bowden setup, so i modified the extruder carriage slightly, created a e3d mount, also designed my own bowden clips since i couldnt find any that are for a 3mm setup, and decided to use a bondtech  filament pusher.

it doesnt like to print abs for longer than 22min jams up in the e3d, but the hatchbox filament i was running was on the large diameter size.  so i decided to use some makergeeks petg which wouldn't print for more than an hour in my hexagon no matter what i did.  actually i have not had a successful petg print from my hexagon out of the 3-4 brands tried using multiple temps, speeds, extrusion rates, etc.  the e3d prints the petg flawlessly, longest print thus far 3 hours in petg i will do a 20 hour test soon.  longest previous with hexagon was nearly 48 hours with abs.

the bowden setup has required a lot of parameter changes in simplify3d (i do not endorse this software or any slicer as they all have debilitating flaws that never seem to be fixed.)  

at this time im using 3.3mm retraction at 35mm/s speed (i think i can uip this to about 60mm/s)  ill need to test further.
im also using .1mm extra restart distance
1mm coasting distance
2mm wipe, while retracting
i also change the parameter ""avoid crossing outline for travel movements"" to checked with 20 as the max detoured factor.  after testing with multiple setups this avg'd about 6-10min longer of a print for a 3 hour print.  i also experimented with it at 100, with no other noticeable effect.

this has been hard to tune due to the properties of petg having a very thin viscosity at temp.  im also about to create another profile for 3dxtech cf petg.

i typically print slow 35mm/s with a travel of 100mm/s.  i know the taz is capable of more but ive had many perfect prints at this speed.  im going to start trying to up the speed to see if ringing has gone away with less mass in the cartesian system.

also i have a pic included of how the bowden set up is currently, open for advice if anyone wants to contribute.
lastly if there is interest in the parts i modified/created then i will upload them to thingiverse.

lastly if any one is wondering yes, that is a taz 6 extruder setup carriage on a taz 5.  yes the fan will hit the z home screw, but if you just take a file to remove part of the fan housing just a bit it works flawlessly.

strange bulge on lower layers.,"after printing a few odds and ends, i decided to push the taz6 to test out what it's ""high detail"" settings looked like.  i picked the following model http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2187632 and sliced it up using the easy print abs settings in the lulzbot cura.  it printed okay, except for a strange bulge about 10 layers up or so.  i've attached pictures.  funny thing is, i'm seeing the same artifact on the same model that's printing right now in pla.  any ideas on what could be causing this?  i looked at the model and the layers in cura, and i don't see anything amiss.","i'm wondering if your z-offset isn't dialed in well, leaving you with extra plastic on a bunch of layers until it finally gets even enough for the next layers to print smoothly.  i've been printing with the same first layer height as the rest of my model and 100% line width to reduce the ""feet"" on my prints, but it took a lot of tweaking on my z-offset to get things to stick well with those settings and i have to use a brim for models that don't have much bed contact.  try using the fish keychain demo model and print just the first layer, if you can peel off each segment from the bed individually then you are good, if they are stuck together you are too close or have the line width too high:

converting 2 single extruder v2's to a dualstruder,"hi everyone,

looking at the prices in the lulzbot store, i see that 2 single extruder v2's ($350) are quite a bit cheaper than a dualstruder ($500). how complicated would it be to buy 2 singles, print out some parts and make a dualstruder out of them? (or even buy one single and use my current single and the new one to create a dual)?","biggest hurdle is the aluminum mount and heatbreak they use in the dualstruders.  itworks3d has them sometimes, but you'll spend $70 on those alone:

https://itworks3d.com/product/dual-extr ... unt-plate/

https://itworks3d.com/product/dual-extr ... r-bracket/

you'll also need to get the heat set inserts and other miscellaneous hardware.  it might be cost effective if you just buy the hotend, not a whole other extruder, but you'll still be pretty close to the retail price if you buy two new ones and try and convert them."

here's a picture- the severed wire is the black on on the left.



brad","this is the part numbers and ordering links for the pins and parts required to make the 2 pin connectors. to make the 4 pin ones for the motors you just get the 4 position housings instead.  you can reuse the plastic housings you already have, and you can probably recrimp the pin on that one that failed without touching the others if you can get it out without damaging the housing (hobby knife, lift the retaining flap, push it out, etc.) 

you will need wire strippers and a crimping tool to fix that. basically you strip about 2mm worth of insulator off, crimp the lower part  on the remaining insulation, then crimp the upper section on the wire. just look at one of the intact pins as an example. i would recommend getting a dedicated crimper for those. you can do it with others, you won't be happy trying it though.

filament runout sensor for octoprint,"greetings,

i've been considering building a filament runout sensor and have this one in mind:
http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2105007



this works with an octopi and can pause the print if the filament runs out. unfortunately it doesn't have dual extrusion support, but i may submit a pr if i have the free time: https://github.com/kontakt/octoprint-fi ... d/issues/3

i see that marlin has filament_runout_sensor support as well, although since i'll be using octopi - no need to tweak my lulzbot marlin config (and pull my hair out when i change toolhead and reflash).

it'll be a few weeks before i build one, but will share my thoughts here.","just what i was thinking of building after having a near catastrophic printer failure with during an out-of-filament condition (the ptfe guide tube went wandering and was pulled into one of the holes in the side of the large gear on the extruder).

any idea how the sensor works on transparent filaments such at t-glase? i would expect some attenuation of ir with t-glase, as well as fanning / dispersion of the ir beam, which might be enough to trip the sensor.

otherwise, i was thinking of something like this but using a roller-type microswitch to detect filament-out, and a second microswitch to detect unusual tension due to a spool jam. any sensor setup like this needs to be reliable both in terms of false positives and false negatives."

realistically you can use almost any nema 17 motor with the rambo board. some of them are going to have additional microstepping, better torque and power characteristics, etc. the moons motors in particular are quite nice, and even an older taz that uses the previous style motors will benefit from installing those in my experience."
acrylic plastic,"hi,

i want to get print house models for my architecture friend, but he told me that i will need acrylic plastic for architecture models. what does he mean? is lulzbot taz 6 capable of printing with acrylic plastic? or anyone here print anything for architecture firm before and what material did you use?","well, no, a taz or any other 3d printer in that price range for that matter isn't going to be able to print acrylic. acrylic is a castable resin, not generally a printable plastic. that being said, your friend is 100% mistaken about needing to use acrylic to make a house model. people can and do use pla, abs, ngen or even nylon or polycarbonate to make architectural models, and it really depends on what you want to present. i've used abs for example to make models of bridges and interchanges for a certain highway department. those work well as solid models. you can do the same thing with exterior solid building models. i've even seen people make entire city layouts out of 3d printed blocks. if you need an interior detail model you can print flat sheets of structure, and then assemble them off the bed afterwards. pla works well for that. 

both abs and pla are paintable, sand-able, can be printed flat and contoured to fit a curve (for curved walls that you can't print that way, etc.) 

the tricky  bits with building printing is openings and windows. you can't really print a square opening without either using support, or having a major bridging element which can lead to quality issues in presentation. 

you might want to take a look at thingiverse and do a search for buildings and architecture to see examples of things people have made along those lines. 

most non printed archatextural models i have seen were made of styrene modeling plastic sheets, not acrylic anyways. acrylic is heavy and prone to damage in shipping/"

we all know that metal composite material for 3d printer is not tough, as such, my client told me it doesn't need to be metal. just print using the toughest material my printer lulzbot taz 6 is capable of.

z axis noise,"completely new so this may be nothing, but reading about the issues with the z when the 6 first shipped, i at least wanted to ask.

if i am using job controls in cura and i run my z to near the top (10 at a time) i hear no noise other than standard printer noise.

however when i run it from the top (not dead into the stops top) down i hear loud whining from the right z rod.

its about in the spool area z height wise, so say it starts more or less at the top of the spool and continues down about 3/4 of the way through the spool and quiets down the rest of the way to the bed.

is this supposed to happen?  and is there a write up on a fix if its an adjustment error?","i'd need to see a video to tell you for sure. louder noise at higher speeds isn't unheard of, and can be a few things, either ignorance or something you will want to fix. you can try applying white lithium grease to the leadscrew itself (and only the leadscrew, never lubricate the bearing rod's, you'll gum them up)  which may improve things. also you can pull it and check for debris in the threads. it's possible you have a loose bolt that is vibrating harmonically and causing problems it could also be a failing 608 bearing or a loose motor coupler, though that would be unusual on a new printer.  

it could also be an alignment issue. that would be a bit more serious."

taz 6 - no greasing required on any axis?,"greetings.

first lulzbot printer here. i have a new taz 6 and read in the manual that no greasing is required for maintenance. obviously i won't grease the drylin bearings or rods, but what about the lead screws?

i use lucas white lithium grease on my other printers:
https://www.amazon.com/lucas-oil-10533- ... b004x70lza","pyrokld wrote:brent.i wrote:just as a note, the lithium grease was recommended on the taz 4 z axis lead screws. we have since redesigned the x end motor and idler, and have found it is not necessary. 

however, it will not hurt anything if you would like to add it to your taz 6 z axis lead screws. as you noted, just keep it off of the smooth rods as it will greatly reduce the life of the self lubricating bushings.

so i went a little crazy and slathered silcone grease all over every bit of exposed metal on things that moved on my printer... but have since wiped it down but there is clearly some still in the bushing.  should i just pop a new set in now or wait until i end up with artifacts?

it'll just cause accelerated wear on the dry bushings, but even then it may very well be a long time for them to wear. an extra pair is always handy to have on hand though."

serious taz 6 dual toolhead wobble,"i am having serious toolhead wobble on a stock dual extruder taz 6. i have made sure the toolhead is seated properly in the v groove (it's flush against the x-carriage and flush on both ends). the wobble is about the x-axis, such that the nozzles (especially the front) are able to move up and down.

part of the wobble appears to be caused by play in the top igus drylin bearing. the rest appears to be both the v-groove mount and the bottom of the toolhead pulling away from the x-carriage.

is this amount of play normal? it's seriously detracting from any medium speed prints. if not, are there any parts i should try to reprint/replace?

any help is appreciated. i'm about ready to fallback to a single extruder.","the dual head to carriage mount interface should be solid with no play.  you may need to loosen the bolts holding the v notch and slide it up to tighten that connection. 

the igus bearings can have play. one trick to minimize that is to loosen the igus bearing mount bolts and slide that mout up or down depending which direction puts more of the bearing in contact with the rod. do the same with the bottom igus holder. if that doesn't do the trick, there are alternative bearings.."
maybe not clogging,"hello all,

i have received a new head tool from lulzbot after the old one broke down.  the new one looks fancy and solved the ""heat creep"".  after printing out for about like 2 weeks, i got a problem.  the filament did not extrude and top part of the filament where the stepper motor pushes down the filament into the nozzle has been craved.  so i thought maybe it was clogging and i had to clean it.  
so i did (i follow videos from youtube and i instruction from lulzbot).  and it did work but not for long and i have to clean again and again when it failed.  i realize with the time that when i was cleaning the nozzle there was nothing making the filament to stop from going doing (no clogs).

so i line the filament kind of 90 degree above the head tool and i made sure that printing does not move around too much.  i have my doubts that it will work for ever.  

does anyone have some tips or have faced the same problem?

thank you and i am sorry for the long story","hello
this is just an update... apparently after i fix the leveling between the bed and nozzle everything went well for certain time but printing stopped again in the midway for several times.  i have tried my best to re-adjust almost anything stand on the way of extruding and still gave me hard time....

not sure where to begin...sub par print quality on my taz 6,"hi there,

wondering if anyone has any suggestions of where to start trying to 'fix' my issue. i've noticed recently that the prints i'm getting off my taz6 have not been very good. i can't recall anything that has happened to cause it or even really when it started happening (sadly i have a lot of printers). after trying to print a small square part (2.25"") standing on end and the side that was supposed to be smooth was full of banding. printing the same part on my mini it came out beautifully.

i fired off a 3dbenchy on the 6 (via sd card) then killed it just as it finished the hull, it was terrible (used cura, quickprint abs standard). moved the filament to the mini, changed the selected machine, reselected the quickprint abs standard, printed it and it came out really nice. moved the filament back to the 6, switched the filament to the 6, switched selected machines, same cura profile selection, printed over usb - again it was terrible. 

i reached out to support and they suggested going into advanced mode and disabling the cooling that is on by default in the quickprint profile. they also said the banding was probably my x carriage out of horizontal alignment and provided instructions to test and adjust. 

the right side appeared to be about 1/16"" low so i followed the instructions to adjust, auto home, etc a few times. excited to print another benchy, i did. sadly, there seems to have been no improvement.

i've replied back to support that it didn't help but i thought i'd also reach out here as i have a small manufacturing batch job next week that needs the 6 - but not with prints like that!

in the pic below on the left is the first 3dbenchy and on the right is the one printed after the adjustment. in the middle is a 20x20x20 cube printed after the adjustment. it measures accurately. thanks in advance for any suggestions.

try that and see if there is any improvement. if not well want to start looking electrical, motor short or thermistor, etc.

everything seemed to check out ok per your first suggestions. lulzbot support sent me a 3dbenchy .gcode file saying they expected the result to be really good. here's the result, first with the same lb white filament, then with blue hatchbox. killed the prints as it was clear they were nothing to write home about. just don't know what is going on with this machine.

moarstruder,"ok, clever mob out there.......

personally i usually need strength above all else, so the moarstruder looks a good idea..... but....

this might seem a silly question (it almost certainly is).... i will fit the moarstruder for 1.2mm printing but will it be ok with smaller nozzles?
ok you change the settings and fit a 0.4 nozzle.... would you expect problems??

seems to be a strength solution, at least untill nylon cored carbon nanotube filament becomes available (in case you haven't tried or seen it... cnt filled with nylon, as opposed to cnt chopped into nylon filament, can be microwaved a produces a virtually perfect high strength print... much better than most casting or forming can produce)

bed leveling,"i just got my taz 6. when i printed the two versions of the rocktopus the print head would touch all four corners of the bed to adjust the leveling. now when i print, including another rocktopus, the unit does not go through the auto leveling procedure. what is the problem?",sounds like you are not using a material profile. you might be in expert mode and you need to revert back to quick-print mode which will load and use the correct material profile for your print.
trade my 4mo old taz 6 for your ultimaker 2+ ??,"i've owned an ultimaker 2+ extended for about a year. when business got busy enough to necessitate a second printer i decided to try a taz 6 based on it's overwhelmingly positive reviews and larger x/y print area dimensions. i've owned it for 4 months now and it has been a near constant disappointment despite all troubleshooting and diagnostic checks indicating it is functioning properly in every way. in my experience (and perhaps specific to the kind of work i do) there has been nothing the taz has done better than the ultimaker and surprisingly few things it has even done as well. i have relied on the knowledge base within this forum to troubleshoot through some of the issues i've had (thank you all) and i've made some of the common modifications that help to enable the printer to do what it should have been engineered to do out of the box. sadly it is still infinitely finicky and unreliable as compared to the bone stock ultimaker.

buys a toyota and complains it is not as good as his lexus. 

pretty much sums it up.is that really the right analogy? i certainly don't see the difference between the um2+ and taz6 to be analogous to toyota vs lexus.  both are priced similarly at $2500, and i consider the build quality and reliability to be similar.  i own neither, but have printed on both -- and both do a great job.  my personal preference would be the taz6 for a few reasons, but that's just me.

looking at the op's other posts, there were pictures of a problem with initial layers deforming.  there wasn't a lot of back-and-forth, so it isn't clear if that's still the issue, but that looked like something easily solved with a little more fan, and perhaps some termperature or esteps tweaking. 

nevertheless, i also understand the op's position here.  he isn't in this as a hobby, he is doing production work -- and just wanted to add capacity with a second printer.  in that situation, he arguably would have been better off with a second identical printer.  now he has two different printers, which will require slightly different slicing parameters -- and an associated time investment in learning the best settings and processes for the taz6 -- to get the same results he could have gotten with no effort had he bought a second um2+.   it sounds like he would just rather invest his time in design and production work, rather than in dealing with differences. 

to the op:  it might be better to just post the taz6 for sale, maybe here or on ebay/craigslist.   a refurbished taz6 with warranty (from itworks3d, for example) goes for about $2,000.  if you can get close to that, you'll have most the price of another um2+ (or perhaps the full price of a used um2+)."
dual extruder woes,"hi all!
for months, my printer has been phenomenal. no issues whatsoever. 
i decided to jump into dual color printing which has been the bane of my existence for a week now. i received my dual head last friday, set it up, everything went smooth. the calibration squares took a while to set up properly, but i am actually blaming myself on this.

with that done, i ran the test lulzbot keychain. i was not impressed with the results. rechecked the nozzle heights,, made some adjustments. for giggles, reran the calibration squares and made finer adjustments.

the results were a bit better on the keychain.

my bottom layers were dead on smooth, like polished smooth so i adjusted my z offset on the printer to account for what i factored in to be about .2mm off. bottom layers are better, but still inconsistent. see screenshot and notice that as it moves up, the layer thickens. i have been running some single color prints for calibration purposes.

before z calibration:



 before z adjustment 


after z adjustment: notice how it gets thicker from top to bottom.






using a raft:






furthermore, anyone with a dual head have the damn thing warm up with nozzle 2 off the bed only to spit out what looks like 300mm of filament allover the desk?

temperaure limit override,"i need any information anyone might have regarding methods for overriding the emergency shutdown temperature settings in the taz firmware.  i have a couple of highly modified taz6's one of which i'm trying to modify to safely (and reliably) use to print ultem (pei).  i have this printer in a custom oven (not the control boards) that i have currently run up to 70 degc without incident.  btw, this allows prints of bulky large profile flat parts (6"" flat square base with sharp corners with bulk) from pc and abs with absolutely no warpage, straight on the bed, with no brim or raft.  with the current config, i figure i wouldn't go above 90 degc in light of all of the abs components in there.  i am currently reprinting the extruder head components out of polycarb along with adding a te cooler to the hotend cooler fan intake to make the head tolerant of the 350+ degc extrusion temp i expect to need.  i intend to print the entire suite of parts within the oven from pc to increase my temp margin for the oven but don't yet know how hot i'll need to go to get reliable printing in ultem at those temperatures.  i will also need to remove the pei sheet from the print surface and will start with kapton as a replacement.  i expect other issues along the way (e.g. motor overheating, belt failure, etc) and will address them as they come up.  for now, my stumbling block is the auto-shutdown temp setting. aleph tech support, as helpful as the generally are, cannot advise me on this issue due to safety/legal concerns so i'm looking here for answers.  i suppose i can trick it by either insulating the temp sensor or putting a resister in line - so that it reads less than the actual head temp - and scaling my feedback accordingly.  i'd much prefer, however, a code solution if possible.",guessing you are going to have to grab the marlin source code from https://code.alephobjects.com/diffusion/marlin/ and after changing the maxtemp lines in the configuration file compile and upload to your rambo.
will modded taz 5 toolhead to flexistruder work?,"so i have a taz 5 (w 0.5mm nozzle hex hotend)that i recently bought and i want to be able to print flexible materials like ninjaflex for example. so what i ended up doing was buying a refurbished taz 5 regular tool head/extruder assembly and then printed out the flexystruder extruder part and put it together along with the ptfe tubing.

so my question is, does this sound like this will work?

also do i really need to flash my firmware? and if i do flash my firmware and i want to switch back to the standard extruder do i need to reflash it again?

i am not sure what e-steps are exactly, i need to look into that more but they are slightly different from the existing extruder to the new flexystruder i build(833 vs 800). so i expect i would at least need to adjust that when changing tool heads. also, do i need to recalculate the e-steps since i modded the tool head?","the flexystruder v2 uses a hexagon hotend, but it does use a 0.6mm nozzle instead of a 0.5mm. the flexy stuff is more viscous, so it needs the additional nozzle width to flow at a reasonable rate. so you may need to swap the nozzle as well. aside from that, yes it will work fine. 

e-steps are the number of e axis, or extruder axis steps that it takes to move a certain distance. here is a really good video showing how stepper motors work and what a step actually is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyqwliowziu .  the extruder steps is somewhat variable between extruders because the hobbed bolts tend to be somewhat variable.  if the hobs are slightly deeper or shallower between two hobbed bolts, that changes the amount of force exerted and the distance traveled per step. think of it like a pizza. if you get the small pizza and put a tape measure around the crust, the measurement is going to be smaller than the large pizza crust. that different diameter affects how much fillament is actually extruded per step, and why you need to calibrate an extruder once, but usually not again after that since the diameter essentially doesn't change."
can the taz6 auto leveling be added to the taz5,say i wanted to add the taz6 auto leveling feature to my taz5.  is this possible?  has anyone done this?  how would you go about adding it?,"yes. there are a couple of approaches you could use. it is possible to purchase the bed parts here: http://itworks3d.com/product-category/p ... z-6-parts/  (you'll need the bed plate, wire harness and switch, the bed rod corner mounts (the spacing is different than the taz 5 position) 4 corner washers, nozzle wiper kit, screws, flex corner thingy, metal posts, another motor mount style endplate to accomodate the taz 6 idler, the taz 6 belt mount assembly, another endstop switch for y maximum endstop, etc) and you would need to modify your extruder wire harness to add the hotend circuit wire. from there it would just be a matter of firmware. you may also want to consider upgrading to the taz 6 motion segment for x and z as well at the same time. the leadscrews are identical, the z rods are identical, the x carriage, rods and bearings are different. the taz 6 frame is also wider than the stock taz 5, so you may need to purchase the slightly longer extrusions for clearance.  the control box hardware, etc. is all pretty much identical internally so you can load the 6 firmware and go once you have all the connections set up. 

you can also look at different ato leveling technologies, such as inductive probes."

","a big part of it is over extrusion. drop the flow rate to 95% or so and see what happens. or do a full calibration. lulzbot printers come calibrated pretty well, but you always need to adjust things a bit for the particular filament and such.

settings you specified in your first post pretty much match mine except for that i print much slower.
i print at about 15mm for the 1st layer then i adjust all the other settings to about 30mm.
your warpage/shrinkage is far more than what i've experienced even when using abs with too much infill.
it looks like your build platform is relatively filled with the parts, so there is plenty of time to cool between layers.
..
have you tried printing with a 10 line brim?
that would hold your parts better to the bed.
..
i've thinned my 97% ipa down to 10% with dilution factors i found on the internet.
i did that because the taz6 manual says to use 10%.
i'm not sure if that makes a difference or not, but i did not want to damage the pei surface with the 97%.
i really don't know if that matters or not.
..
i've also noticed that when i've been running abs, ngen or ninjaflex and switch between filaments that
it takes a few cleanings with the 10% ipa before my adhesion comes back.  sometimes when switching between 
filaments, i'll use glue stick, then wash the bed with wet rag and wipe again with ipa.

what is the easiest way to fix this? replace the harness? replace the pin?","you are under warranty, call support, they will get you all fixed up. the pins can be ordered and crimp installed if you prefer to do it yourself. digikey has them, and the part numbers are in the taz bill of materials (bm) in develop.lulzbot.com

a broken pin is rare but not unheard of. i in particular suck at installing my own crimp pins and have broken more than a few of my own."
spool holder-box-dryer,"i have my taz5 for almost two years now and even before i got it, i was concerned of a couple of things. first, the fact that the material was exposed out in the dust and everything else in the room while printing and second, the humidity and everything related to it. i must say i like my taz and one thing i really like is the building volume.
so i knew i had to find a way to keep my filament protected at all times during short and long prints and, if possible, dry. and when i was introduced to nylon filaments i knew i had to find a way to keep them dry for sure. and then there were the filled filaments that, according to manufacturers, due to their brittle nature when cold, should be fed through a heated path.
and, almost two years later, i can finally say that i have an almost finished project that i can share with anyone interested at. i have to say though that it may seem simple but it's actually a bit complex because it involves some knowledge of diy electronics and pcb making, unless someone can help you with this.
so, here are some pictures:






























the box and the hinges are made of ngen. i have tried abs, hips and pla but they would suffer either from warping, delamination or the temperature. ngen printed out without a hiccup and with a tg of 85c works just fine for me.
the hatch on the side, right beneath the ptfe feeder, is required for accessing and feeding the filament in the tube and for providing the blower fan. it is designed to print with the entire box, serving as a support as well, and just snaps off at the end.
the gray slots that hold the hot wire are made of ngen flex due to its flexibility and extreme tg of almost 120c.
the bolt that holds the spool is m6 and not m8 for a very simple reason: i couldn't find a way to make a 3d printed retainer strong enough to use with a 608 ball bearing and still fit a taulman small spool (1lb). and i love these nylons! so, m6 it was using the 626 ball bearings.
the hot wire that i use comes from mcmasters and it is the flexible 8ft-24v/1a one. for the box i use two (2) of these and one for the ptfe tube. as you can see from the pictures, i just twisted the wire around the ptfe tube and used a clear tape to keep it in place and insulate it just a bit from the environment.
the blower fan help to circulate the hot air inside the box, improve the drying process and protects the box from overheating the walls. early designs didn't have the blower and the box, running on 48w (2x24w hotwires), was getting really hot on top (heat goes up, right?) affecting its shape! now the temp goes up to 65-70c and works great. running 24w on the ptfe tube rises the temp up to about 65c.
the thermostat circuitry is designed to use a 10k thermistor for control (t and ?t) and a ksd9700 bimetal thermostat for overheat protection.

this post is getting really big, so i stop here. i only want to say that this design has worked great for me and i just can't think of any other way to work with nylons and pcs.

should anyone feel that would like to give it a try, just let me know and i will post the stls, the bom and instructions.","thanks tim.
funny thing is that, when i decided to group all the things i did and attempt to present to you all, i found myself in front of a wall! and then i remember you when you were trying to put together the v-rail upgrades! it can be really overwhelming the whole process.

anyways, here are all the latest stl files i have on this, along with some pictures for the pcb parts. i assume the use of positive development process, otherwise the photos need to be inverted. for the record, i put in the stl filenames the suggested nozzle size and layer thickness for most parts.

"help request: leveling a taz 5, by undoing previous mistakes?","hello,

i'm having some issues leveling my taz 5. hoping restoring it to factory settings will help. i've shared my problems below, starting off with a description of what i'm envisioning as a next step to figuring out the logic errors i'm using in my current process. 

from my understanding the following aspects control alignment:

- stepping motors

- 'z-stop' (the sensor for z, on the left)

- top hex nuts on the bed component 

- (?) the bed clamp tightness 


it takes me far too long to level, i'm hoping get it back to original position will help. for example, do i tighten all the hex nuts on the bed, or loosen them? i feel like my adjustments sometimes fix the problem but don't in the long run...and i've watched the tutorial video, but haven't found it as in depth as i might like or need in my situation. 

problems i'm having:

- calibration print works fine

- printing another part, it doesn't adhere near the center, and starts to gum up the print head (of course ruining the print). 

--(before i was at this point, i had tried adjusting for the right side printing too close to the bed, while the left side was perfect.)

- the z-sensor is at it's lowest (i remember it being higher when i first got the printer a few years ago)

thanks for your help everyone/anyone.","piercet wrote:here is a procedure to ensure a good starting bed level for your taz: 

1. check both z leadscrews at the top where they enter the upper 608zz bearing. both leadscrews should be all the way up and flush with the top center of the bearing as viewed from the top of the machine.
2. with the machine off and the motors unplugged, measure the distance from the bottom of the z leadscrew nut to the top of the lower z leadscrew 608zz bearing. the distance should be identical on both sides. if they are not identical, manually turn one leadscrew on one side until they are identical. 
3. check the distance from the printed corner bed mounts to the aluminum bed mount plate. the distance from the bottom of each corner mount to the top of the mount plate should be the same initially, and the corner mounts should be parallel to the heated bed. it is possible for them to work loose at an angle, or to come un anchored from the bed but still attached by weight. if you have different heights at this point, reset them all to the height of the mount closest to the bed mount plate for now. this will ensure the mount is further from the nozzle, not closer to it when we start the printer back up here in a minute. the nozzle expands thermally, it is important to level with the nozzle at full expansion for best results
4. turn the printer on, and heat it to normal operating temperature (bed and nozzle) now wait a full 3 minutes. 
5. with the printer at temperature, locate a thin metal plate (about the thickness of a business card). the gauge that ships with the printer works well for this. now move the nozzle to each corner of the heated bed, and use that gauge to carefully and without burning yourself adjust the corner of the heated bed until the nozzle is just touching the top of the gauge and the gauge is touching the top of the heated bed. repeat this process on all four corners. adjust the z height adjustment target as needed to get the initial height for the first corner. turning the cap head screws in the corner clockwise lowers the corner closer to the bed, counterclockwise raises it. 

at this point all 4 corners of the bed should be at the same height relative to the nozzle. now print the bed level test pattern gcode (on the sd card or available at download.lulzbot.com) and see if you get a good adhesion pattern that is consistant. adjust the z height screw up or down as needed. if after leveling you find this height drifts rapidly, consider applying a small amount of some elmers white glue or blue loctite to the threads of the height adjuster (not red loctite!) this will make it more difficult for that adjustment screw to turn accidentally. 

if it continues to be a problem, take a look at the micrometer endstop target modification. 

hope that helps!

edit: 
if you find you have inconsistent results with the leveling, it is possible a portion of the frame is out of alignment, or the z leadscrews on one side are out of alignment. there are additional fixes for that.

hi, great help, again thanks! 

i don't see ""lead screws"" on the top, or am i mistaken? i see the black rods going up into the bearing you mentioned but there's a smooth metal cap on top.

for one thing, the frame was out of alignment due to the surface not being level but i have corrected that.

now i'm printing the calibration and it's working...but then my prints still pop off and get jammed. not sure why the calibration would come out ok and the same issue would happen; tho i've traced this issue in the past to an unlevel bed."
taz 5 small prints getting knocked off bed at the same height each time,"my prints are getting detached from the bed at exactly the same height, (tested with 2 marvin prints and 1 benchy print). 
i'm not sure if it's just usual adhesion problems because it happened at exactly the same layer each time.






i actually saw it happen with one of the marvin prints - everything fine, good solid base, then it looked like the nozzle pushed on the part and it popped off the bed.

the printer is rather new, but previous prints have turned out fine. these prints are the first ones after i changed the extruder idler block, after the stock one developed cracks.","the white spot is actually a space between the heating element and the glass.. not sure if this is normal but that sagging area goes away once it heats up.

i have been printing at 110. will take a look at the z leadscrews but i'm not sure that's it. the prints literally pop off at the exact same line each time, and i've tried printing on different parts of the bed."
lulzbot taz 6 flexydually z movement too small,"dear community,

i just installed my lulzbot taz 6 flexydully tool head and began by printing the benchy with only one filament. pla in the back extruder, no fillament was inserted into the front flexible extruder. when the print began it looked like the first layer was nice and even; in fact the next three layers looked good, but as i reached the 5th layer the nozzle seemed to be impacting the perevious layer, and before i knew it the nozzle was just dragging around in the plastic and by layer 10, i had to stop the job because the nozzle was just dragging around in the plastic.

i would describe it as the z-axis not moving up enough, as if it was moving 95% the required z-movement, and by the time we reach 10 layers,  the nozzle is buried in the previous layers.

here's things i've tried.
1) re-flashing the lulzbot to its defualt settings and firmware for the flexydually. - same results
2) adjusting the z offset to -1.000 instead of -1.500.  - same results
3) lowering pla temp to 215 deg c from 220 deg c. - same results
4) drinking more coffee. - still upset

anyways,

any ideas, questions, of feedback would be much appreciated.

thanks,

afrl maker hub!",i have seen something similar when printing a solid infill.  in my case the printer was extruding a few percent too much material.  after a few layers it's enough to be noticeable.  in the extreme case i could see the the print head bouncing as it passed over the bumpy surface that results from the nozzle dragging through the excess material.
new taz 6,"received my taz 6 today from amazon and while unpacking i noticed my silicone pad is pretty ragged around the edges

will this affect the function of the heated bed



 print bed 
","kmanley57 wrote:i have seen beds like that. you are seeing the silicon has detached and exposed the fiber weave inside of the pad that the wires are running in. that is a 'recycled/reused' heat pad pretty sure.that's my conclusion, too.  my best guess would be that the original purchaser broke the glass, then removed the heater and pei and reused them on new glass (with damaged adhesive, and rubber torn from the bed's fiberglass mat), then returned it to amazon.
dropcode wrote:it was sold directly from amazon shipped from amazon.  it appears that the rubber is torn. could you have clicked on a ""warehouse deal"" at amazon?  those are returns which amazon repacks and resells.  aside from a cursory look at the box and contents, they basically take the word of the customer who returned it as to functional condition.  warehouse deals are ""sold and shipped by"" amazon, but they were in the hands of another buyer first - and sometimes are not functional, even though the party returning them told amazon it was perfect.

if it wasn't a ""warehouse deal"", then somehow amazon accepted it back thinking it was ""unopened / never used"" and returned it to stock, where it was subsequently used to fill your order.

in any case, report the problem to amazon and send it back.  the heater is damaged (rubber covering torn off), and there are air pockets visible in the adhesive.  it looks horrible and i wouldn't trust it.  if the glass was replaced, it might not even be the right type of glass."
another taz 5 out of round question,"i have a puzzling out of round problem.  i'm currently printing mating herringbone gears and noticed that one axis is pretty significantly larger then it's perpendicular axis.  this troubled me because i did quite a bit of calibration to get my prints as accurate as possible.

so out of round tells me that something is loose or that one of the axis steps are off.  the puzzling part of this problem comes from the fact that the large/small axis are both 45 degrees off from the x/y axis on the printer.  they are parallel with the infill direction of the print.

this tells me that either the x or y motion command is being sent to the printer before the other, causing an offset due to mistimed x/y motion.  i could very easily be overthinking this.  please let me know of anything that could cause a 45 degree oval...

i'm at work at the moment, so i can't attach any information about the print.  i have only tried using cura, but was planning on seeing if slic3r had the same problem when i get home this evening.

the measurements of the printed gear are as follows.  i'm not sure which is the x axis and which is the y axis because it's a circle and i didn't know there was a problem until i pulled the part off the printer and put it in the enclosure.

x and y axis outer diameter:  57.63mm and 57.60mm
45 degrees off from x and y axis (parallel to the infill axis):  57.14mm and 57.97mm

i got my taz 5 for christmas and have been tinkering ever since.  i have the openrail x and y axis mod installed, the taz 6 extruder (version 2.1), the improved extruder mount, anti-z-wobble thingies, and i think that's all so far.  i printed these gears at between 30 and 50mm/s in all the speed settings in cura.  everything looks beautiful, there's just this weird oval-ness at 45 degrees.

tonight i'm going to try to print these gears from slic3r.  then i'm going to try to print the same gear multiple times, but rotate it 45 degrees each time to make sure it's not a problem in my model.  then possibly try printing the same gear in multiple places on the build plate to see if that changes anything.  not sure what else to try.","interestingly enough, i may have just figured it out.  i printed dozens of calibration cubes while working on all the mods and fine tuning the x/y steps.  looking at those cubes it appears that my x and y axis are not perfectly perpendicular.  the cubes align next to each other perfectly with the z axis up, but if i flip them on their sides there is a slight gap between a cube with the x axis up and a cube with the y axis up.  withe either x/x or y/y up they align perfectly.

so my calibration cubes looking at them from top down appear to be parallelograms instead of squares.  i'm not sure exactly how i'm going to be able to fix such a tiny angle offset between my x and y axis, but at least i have a place to start now."
taz 6 bed cooling during auto-level,"printing abs at 110c for the first layer.

i'd like to be able to preheat the bed so that i can let everything stabilize before probing, but i'm noticing the temperature drops about 20c during the auto-leveling sequence. so besides being at random temps when probing, it also takes about 10 minutes to get back up to temp. some times i have to restart the print because of a funky first layer and when it's all said and done it can be up to 30-40 minutes just to get a good print started.

is there any control for the bed probing temperature in the firmware or maybe a g-code command to control this?","i havn't looked at it or tinkered with it in quite a while on my mini, but yes if you go into the advanced cura settings you can edit the startup gcode and change the bed probing temp. whether this is a good idea i don't know.

alternatively you should be able to do the same thing when you save your model as gcode and then edit the gcode file in a text editor."
thermal runaway on taz5 heated bed,"so out of nowhere, my bed is climbing in temp at a steady rate with no set temp! just turn printer on, and away it goes. it reached 135 by the time i noticed the first time.

resuming print doesn't resume extrusion  (taz 5),"hey all, i wonder if anyone else has this problem (and hopefully a solution   ): when i try to pause and then resume a print on my taz 5, whether from the lcd interface or via cura/usb connection, it starts moving again (x, y, and z axes) but never extruding! i've tried this several times with different prints, and it always fails, so i end up reprinting the whole thing. i don't think the nozzle is immediately getting clogged, because i move the print head away from the model, replace/re-insert the filament, and successfully extrude a decent amount before resuming. whaaaat is going on. can't seem to find anyone else discussing this (maybe my search skills suck).

i don't know if this is related, but i've also had a few prints just... freeze midway through—i.e. the head stops moving, extruder stops extruding (well, that's lucky), but both the hotend and bed stay at temp, and the lcd says it's still printing. head scratcher, that. this has only happened printing from the sd card; however, i don't typically print from a computer anymore, since i need to drag my laptop to work... and that's prime printin' time. so i can't definitively say it wouldn't do the same.

edit: not sure if this is relevant, but for the second issue (stopping mid-print), even after i ""stop print"", it still says ""printing..."".

s.o.s. please send help!","this reply comes late for the questioner but i want to reply in case someone else has same issue of print halting midway when using the sdcard. 

i faced the same symptoms. i printed twice from the sd card and both cases it stopped at same spot leaving heaters on. this made me worried something might happen one day if i cannot troubleshoot why the print stopped like that.

i checked that the file in the sd card looked ok. i then printed the same original gcode file from my pc directly with cura - no issues. i also copied the file again from my pc to another sdcard and it worked now ok. i finally formatted the original sd card and i haven't had this issue since. i'm still using the same sdcard. so if this happens again try to format your sd card.

any thoughts n the e3d titan extruded?,saw a youtube video of this new assembly from e3d. wondering if there are any thoughts around it. is it a potential improvement over the stock taz unit?,"so i just got it installed into the printer and it's heating up to 285 for the final nozzle tightening. it was a lot of work, requiring a whole new x carriage - i think thats the proper term - the piece that the motor, gears, etc all mount to with the 'blade' at the bottom that self centers on the x axis.

i went with a design that has the motor flush with the back of it, touching the x carriage piece. i figured that this way, as much of the motor weight as possible as as close to the x rails as possible. the farther out you put it, the more it could cause the rails to twist, giving you some sag. closer center of gravity.

because of that i had to move the fan that cools the print to the other side (and reverse it's angle).

the stock fans that come with it to cool the heatsink are 12v, i decided to connect them to the extruder 1 fan output, and if you run that at 50% speed, it gets 12v, and works great. an added side effect is i can turn the fan off when not printing.

it was a lot of work. i'll post pics and stuff in a bit once i get this going and do a few test prints.

my taz extruder had extra crap on it - a capacative leveling system, an extra fan on the heat sinks. it weighed 762 grams.

the new one, with the titan, with the same/equilivant equipment on it weighed in at 611 grams - 20% less weight. that's using a standard nema17 motor, not one of the shorter ones. didn't spend the money on it yet. if i switch up to that smaller motor, i'll probably knock off another 20% in weight.

i'm not sure how much reducing the x carriage weight by 20% will effect print quality/max speed, but at 20% less mass to accel/decelerate, it has to be a decent improvement."
layer offset issue - not sure if mechanical or software,"i have a taz 4 where i have upgraded the extruder and flashed the taz 5 firmware. i never had any problem in the past with printing until recently where every part i print over a few cm in height have some layer offset issues.











i tried printing the exact same file multiple times however it seems that the offset issue happens at a different height each time. just to rule out gcode issues i tried to reslice the file with a different program with the same issue. ive used both cura and s3d, and when using a gcode viewer i do not see any kind of issues.

i have also tried tightening both the x and y axis timing belts to make sure there is enough tension in the belts. i have checked the set screws on the stepper motor clamps and both are secure and extremely tight. i've also check the bearings, bolts, screws, nothing seems to be loose.

i have tried to orient the parts so that while printing it would minimize movement in one of the axis's to make sure that slipping is not the issue. i did this for both x and y and there were no changes, there was still an offset happening at random heights. i have also tried to relevel the bed to make sure that it was not somehow contributing to the issue.

not sure where to go from here in order to pinpoint if this is a mechanical or software issue.","whatever it is, its in your x axis.  if it's mechanical it could be the following:
1. loose x motor pulley setscrew (can cause a slight shift side to side even if belt is otherwise tight)
2. broken x motor shaft (unlikely since the rest of the print is coming out fine) 
3. inadequate belt tension (should make a sound like plucking a low guitar string when you pluck the belt)
4. gummed up or failing x rod bearings
5. bent or otherwise offset x rods (unlikely, print would fail earlier) 
6. loose x toolhead on carriage or otherwise loose x carriage
7.  belt drag due to improper angle on the belt to idler or belt to motor loop
8. bad idler bearings
9. an x axis alignment issue, 

if it is none of those, it's probably electrical, usually a heat sink has fallen off a motor control chip, the exhaust fan has failed, or the control board is in an enclosure and isn't vented properly and is overheating. 

it's minutely possible that is a y axis issue shifting sideways in the x axis direction, possibly due to a loose bed plate or a loose y frame mount, but that is unlikely to the point it probably isn't even worth checking. if either of those were loose, you would know it because all of your prints would be failing on layer 2"
taz 6 bed temperature calibration?,"while printing abs with the bed temperature set to 110c, i checked it with an ir thermometer across the entire bed. the thermometer read one small spot at close to 110c and the rest of the bed ranged from 115c to 124c.

is there a way to calibrate the sensor so it reports 110c when most of the bed is 110c?

or do i need to modify the thermistor location / installation ?","sop is to roll with default thermister values. every bed is different, and knowing it's at 110 vs 120 doesn't matter nearly as much as knowing what value works."
taz 6 dual extruder micro switch,the single extruder has a micro switch on the right side.  the dual extruder does not have this micro switch and bangs against the far right stop during the auto leveling procedure.  is this normal?,"mine does this too. is there room to level a bit closer to the center of the bed? if so, you can download the source for the lulzbot marlin firmware here, and modify configuration.h so code: select allright_probe_bed_position is a couple mm smaller. compile and download it using arduino 1.0.6 (note the version). before you flash it, run m501 to echo back all the eeprom settings. write these down, as these will be reset with a fw update. once you flashed it, set all the parameters to what was in the eeprom, and then use m500 to store them back in eeprom.

note that that firmware is for the regular dual extruder, not the flexydually."
taz 6 extruder harness snagging prints leading to failue,"so i have discovered that the harness hose that is zip tied to the frame binds against very large prints in the build volume when the printer gets close to full height in the print leading to failure.  i noticed a huge gash in the hose where it caught my last print before it ripped a 48 hour print off the bed.  does anyone have a solution for holding the hose up above the build volume?  i tried moving it around but it seems that the range of motion might be affected if it gets moved from where it is too much....

i'll update this with a photo when the next print (in progress) gets to the point of snagging...","there isn't really a good solution to that. if the cable is too short, your only option is to make it longer, and adaptors don't work well in that location. if you are handy at crimping and wire stripping the parts should be in one of the ods files in here: http://download.lulzbot.com/taz/6.01/production_docs/ (excel will open them) 
the is a y axis cable chain modification that will fit the taz 6 http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1145951 , but i'm not aware of a cable chain mod that will fit the stock taz x carriage. technically you can fit my openbuilds taz 6 x axis and make the taz 5 cable chain setup for it fit http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1277441, but either way you would still need to extend the wire, and i don't know that the cable exit points are really going to line up on a 6 box since i don't have one to test with."
quick unbox and first print with the moarstruder,"got my moarstruder this weekend and did a very quick & dirty youtube unboxing and first print with it. link is below. it is wild to watch a 1.2mm layer being laid down. a few days ago i printed something that took 45 hours but was estimated at 39 hours in cura. loaded the same model in cura while it was configured for the moarstruder and it estimated just over 10 hours. not bad!

there aren't many quickprint profiles prepackaged with it interestingly. lacking is an abs profile (not sure why) but i'm going to do some experimenting. 

this is my first yt so sorry about the camera work & lighting.

extruder steps calibration. what am i missing?,"been trying to dial in the first layer with a dual extruder head.

at default cura settings of 125% initial line width and 100%flow rate it has been over extruding. i dialed the first layer width down to 100% and backed the flow rate down to 95-96% and tweaking at layer 5 down to 94% to actually get a decent first layer pattern and overal print pattern. so to me it sounds like the extruders' steps/mm are off slightly. note: i said slightly.

i marked the filament and clicked extrude 10x expecting 100mm of travel. it only pushes through 80mm. ok possibly mis-counted. manually sent a g1 with 100mm extrusion and got the same result.

my first thought is maybe the hobbed bolts are a different size than the single extruder because the dual extruders' steps/mm were a lot different than the single head. 808 on the dual vs. 851 on the single. to me it wouldn't make sense to have different sizes between the two, but i didn't design it.

anyone have any thoughts?","mikeo wrote:you might try cutting your extrude speed by 50% or more when doing that test, if you can do that in cura (i don't use cura).

if the manual extrusion is trying to push too much plastic out of the nozzle either the filament drive is slipping or the drive stepper motor is losing steps, in either case due to the back pressure.

i've had that problem, and cutting the extrude speed down by 50% or more gave me the numbers i expected.

i thought maybe it was that too. but i opened a gcode file of an actual print and it was about 500-900. i'm extruding at 100-150.

today i did several tests and lowered the e-steps by 8 every time and upped the flow rate by 1% and it stayed consistent. at 776 steps/mm i got the normal flow rate up to 100% but had to up the first line width to 125% which i'm fine with because that's the defaults. i'm still having to tweak the flow rate down to 94% after five layers to get a good top layer.

to add even more confusion, i re-measured the extruded amount after all the tweaking and now it's only extruding 76mm when i do a ""g1 e100 f100"". but i'm getting really good prints so maybe i should just leave it alone and not worry about the numbres not making sense.

edit: i guess it's not that confusing since i was trying to reduce the extrusion amount."
taz 6 layer shift after 24 hours - happened twice at around same spot,"hi,

i am printing several full envelope prints and have had a layer shift of about 1 cm forward (x?) on 2 of my most recent prints.  this happened after 24 full hours of printing so its a huge waste of filament.  i'll try to salvage it with my 3d pen but it's just annoying.  

i'm not sure what is happening because both times it occurred while i was sleeping.  any suggestions?  i checked that the belts are tight and they seem to be.  the only thing i can think is that the support structures in cura almost never stick to the build plate and i end up with a mess...  the print turns out mostly fine but all tangled up but some of the mess winds up on or around the gears or belts and i'm thinking maybe a piece of loose material lodged into a belt causing it to slip.  i have no way of telling because it's clear now....

anybody?




","i struggled with this issue for a long time with with a big print and it wasn't until i caught it happening that i finally figured out what was going on.  what happened to me was the print had a design element that required it to start printing layers at a very shallow angle (think like a zero entry kids swimming pool).  as the the nozzle would circumnavigate the layer in the shallowest portion of the layer that layer would slowly start curling upwards north of the layer's elevation.  as the distortion would continue, the nozzle would struggle to melt its way through the growing distorted layers on each pass.  eventually it would get so high that the nozzle couldn't go through it and would grind the motor.  sometimes it would knock the part loose, other times it would just keep going about its business but off by however much the motor ground.  the machine has no way of know where it is other than by where it just was.  when it unexpectedly runs into something, that is how you can get those sorts of layer shifts.

if you carefully examine the failed part just below the level of the shift, you might find the telltale signs of this.  look for a distorted glob of material where the material built up and the nozzle kept running into it before it eventually failed.

to deal with it you can adjust how the part sits on the bed to avoid those shallow angles.  i've also switch to simplify3d which has a feature allowing you to have each layer start at a random location.  this seems to help."
anyone put a thermocouple on a taz 5?,i have a e3d v6 hotend on my taz5 and am planning on upgrading the temperature sensor so that i can get temperatures up to 400c.  i want to be able to use ultem filaments.  are there any issues to this?,"hi penn1793,

taz 6...shocking!,"my taz 6 was in the middle of a print and i happened to brush my hand against it, causing a pretty decent static shock.  well, this caused the print to stop, and the printer shut off and came right back on.  has anyone had this issue?  if so, does anyone know of a way to ground the machine?

thanks.","if you look at the assembly info for the taz 6  control box https://ohai.lulzbot.com/project/taz6-c ... bly/taz-6/ it's pretty well grounded at multiple points. i'm not sure how you would really add much more in the way of grounding to it. i've never managed to static zap mine taz 3-ish version which has been upgraded to a similar grounding setup, and i tend to emit quite a lot of static for some reason.  the only thing i can think of is if the lcd isn't designed with adequate grounding in, which would be a problem with the whole fleet of fullgraphic lcd type lcd's. i do know they have one other existing flaw in that they will eventually develop a dark pixle spot right over the sd card hole, so it wouldn't surprise me if grounding could be improved there. i'm not sure how you would go about doing that short of rebuilding that circuit though. my lcd is positioned so i hardly ever brush by it, but the lcd does have control inputs and essentially a db9 serial bus, so static could definitely be a concern there. i'd be curious what an inline anti static device would do there though. it still should be ground anyway through the motherboard though."
taz 5 stops mid-print,"i have had several instances where our taz 5 just stops in the middle of a print.  no error message.  just stops.  holds temperature.  lcd display responds.

sometimes i think it is the gcode.  i regenerate and save the code and it works.  i believe i have experienced this both in cura and in simplify3d (which i really like).

has anyone else noticed this?","piercet wrote:if you are printing via usb, and the prints pause and stop, it's almost certanly your computer that is the issue. it's slightly possible that this is an overheating issue of the control box. but it's usually the host computer. you want to make sure the host computer is set to ""high performance"" under power settings in control panel, and ""usb selective suspend"" is set to disabled under advanced power options for the high performance setting. otherwise your usb ports can go to sleep if the computer is unattended for long periods of time. the arduino ide doesn't always sucessfully manage to transmit a port ""keep alive"" signal during serial communications, so it can sometimes let the ports go idle if no one else is attending the computer at the time. screen saver is also the enemy, disable it. 


if you have all those things set already, you will want to look at other settings. do you have enough ram and processor overhead? is your video card getting bogged down rendering the model progress. do you have a virus that is transmitting things at intermittant intervals, which is bogging the computer down, etc.

hardware or firmware,"i've worked to dial in my two taz 5's to be able to run from the same profile, which saves me a little hassle.  however, i've finally confirmed something i've suspected for a while.  one printer is slower than the other.  on a 3 hr print, it's about 15 minutes off printing the identical gcode sent at the same time.  same firmware.  so is there something in the printer settings that i may of accidentally changed that would cause one printer to be slower?","try running m501 on both. it'll read out your stored eeprom settings for acceleration and jerk, as well as some other stuff. if your slicer doesn't output any commands to override these defaults (e.g. m204 m205), they could very well be different from one printer to the other, and have an effect on your prints. you can fix it two ways: either insert something like code: select allm204 p[printing_accel] r[retract_accel] t[travel_accel]

taz 6 heated bed variances?,"i have a taz 6 that is working great but when i print large contact surfaces the first layer has this effect in it. it doesn't effect the overall print but was curious...is this because of variances in the temperature of the bed or surface variances? when you run your hand across that area i can't feel any bubbles or differences but these layers are at .1mm so maybe even the slightest amount shows?








this is as it lays down the 2nd layer. 




","cool - thanks! i will give that a try (i am slicing with simplify3d). i am already using a .08 offset because it literally was so close it was barely able to squeeze any filament out... (this was with the simplify3d taz 6 profile). so i bumped it up to .08. but i have never adjusted the thicker first layer. i will see if i can locate that option and boost it.  i also adjusted the extrusion multiplier from .90 to .95 because i was not getting my layers filled fully and that fixed that issue.

note with cura...it was never an issue - their first layer is always thick/perfect. but i love the supports and interface of simply3d better so been trying to get it dialed in to be as good as cura.


scottw wrote:hard to tell, but it is probably slight surface variation (perhaps slightly stretched pei/adhesive from previous print removals) causing thin extrusion in those areas.  the usual protection against that is a thicker ""first layer"".  even if printing at 0.1mm, i would suggest a first layer height at least double (and perhaps triple) that.

edit:  looking closer, it may be that you are starting too close to the bed.  i can see that each line of extrusion on the first layer is thinner in its center, with thicker areas at the edges where the plastic has been forced to the sides.  again, a thicker first layer is the easiest solution.  but if you really want the 0.1mm first layer, you might try adding 0.02 to 0.05 to your z-offset (either in slicer, or via m851).  that *may* be enough to lessen the gaps you are getting on the ""high spots"" of the surface."
print stuck to surface...,"i have had some tough ones to remove but this is crazy. i used the light sanding technique i read here to keep edges from warping...worked great but now i cannot get the print off. i used some isopropyl alcohol along edges...etc and she won't budge. this is fairly flat with full contact coverage at .25-.75 inches tall and 8 x 6 inches wide.




","well done. i usually leave my bed temp holding at 45-50° c for removal and that works well. i have also reheated the bed to 50-60° c after being off to remove a print. another tip i picked up here is to pour a very small amount of alcohol around the edge of print, specially a large flat print, and let it seep under the edges, and that will release the print in most cases. but if you do that, be careful and stand by with a rag to keep any alcohol from running off the edges of the bed. you don't want the alcohol to contact any electronic or wires."

taz 4 belt problem,"i've been getting some print problems related to the belt on the x axis of my taz 4.  i noticed that the belt has slid up against the bearing block where the belt slides on the bearings.  this friction is wearing down the belt a bit and giving some issues with print quality.

interesting print failure,"hello, i recently had a print failure that i have not seen before. 
due to the design of the model, there is only a small portion touching the base, and the rest is on support structure. it seems that the print has warped somehow. perhaps the large body of the print is too far away from the heated surface? im not sure what would cause the part to pull its self away from the bed. ive never had anything come off the bed before, in my experience every print is stuck hard to the surface. 
any ideas? thanks

https://youtu.be/n_c_-b0mnva","that print experianced ""lifting"" which is usually found wiht abs prints that contract away from the heated bed due to inadequate bed temperature and too much cooling. in this particular case you have a large surface area of what is essentially radiative support fins that are cooling that section of the plastic much faster than the upper mass. that is going to be a tricky one to fix. i'd try extruding a full outer 0.5mm support wall to encapsulate the plastic once it gets to that level, increase the bed temperature (if this is abs, try 110c) and even if this is abs, try adding as much cooling fan as you can get away with once it reaches the main part to prevent edge contraction. too much fan and you will get bad interlayer adhesion, too little in that particular configuration and you will get lifting. even if this is pla thats probably still enough cooling surface area that it's going to cool wierd and torque itself without a stronger bed temperature and an outer wall."
taz4 + moarstruder,i have a taz4 but i've upgraded it more than a year ago to use with the v2 extruder (hexagon hot end). i was wondering if anyone could explain why the moarstruder works with the taz5 but not taz4. is the rambo control board different?,"in order to run a taz 4 with a moarstruder you will need to have upgraded your printer to use a v2c hot end.

specifically for the 4:

* install internal harness blower in order to operate the additional 5v cooling fan. (this wasn't stock on the taz 4)
                  * internal wiring harness
* upgrade your external wiring harness to the v2c in order to have the connectors match. 
                  * external wiring harness

after that everything should work for you, you may just need to adjust your y axis plate a few mm to make room for the left hand fan duct."
broken heatsink tube,"ok guys, so around thanksgiving i had a mishap with my taz 5.  being a first time owner i didn't realize just how delicate some of these parts are and i broke the heatsink tube from the heater block.  now yes i know i can buy an entire assembly for $70, but honestly all i think i need is just the heatsink tube that i can get at itworks3d.com (https://itworks3d.com/product/hexagon-h ... sink-tube/) or should i get this (https://itworks3d.com/product/hexagon-3 ... -assembly/) to make my life easier as far as putting in the thermosister properly.  i don't know how far it's supposed to go in as when i was messing with the broken one first off one of the wires broke off, but i believe i soldered back on properly, but second it seems the wire can go back into the thermistor hole a few more mm.  or do i just go with the entire assembly (https://www.lulzbot.com/store/parts/lul ... on-hot-end) and if i do how is the wiring tied into the main harness? trying to save cash anywhere i can.  suggestions are appreciated!  thank you!","the tube is installed with a high temperature blue loctite compound. if you don't apply that compound, you can get leaks. it's $35 a container for it. if you broke the wires off the heater core, you are going to want to replace it. soldier joints will not hold at that high temperature area, and you will get a machine failure. small crimp barrels can be used, but those components are only around  $2 to replace anyways that electrical equipment is arguably the most important part of your 3d printer so it makes sense to spend a little more to get a solid connection, especailly when we aren't talking more than $10.  https://itworks3d.com/product/hexagon-3 ... -assembly/ is a good option. 

depending on what version of taz you are going from and what hotend wireing harness you have already, you may very well need to cut and re crimp the ends. the one direct from the lulzbot store has a 4 pin connector block, 2 for the thermistor and 2 for the heater core. polarity doesn't matter in this case, so you just need to make sure that the 2 from the thermistor are matched up to the two harness that go to your thermistor input, etc. mixing them up will damage your components and will probably damage your rambo board. 

if you are going from an older budaschnozzle equipped model, you also need to run the wire for the center bore cooling fan (required) and optionally the auxiliary fillament cooling fans for better print quality. 

here is the step by step instructions for doing so:

for a taz 4:

yes, if you upgrade to a 24 volt supply you should get a new 24 volt case fan. the 12 volt fan will be very loud as it is running at twice the needed voltage, and i believe might burn out faster. i see that it-works3d has the 24 volt 4 wire fan, they might not be as quiet as the old one. i have had loud and very quiet ones both, so ymmv."

serious air under bedsheet/bubbling on first print,"hi,

i recently bought a taz 6, owned a mini for more than one and a half year.

on my first build after the rocktopus (so my first ""real"" print) the build plate got white in large areas with air bubbles and pockets. it was visible already when printing the first layer (so before any part had been removed). once cooled down you can feel a slight bulge on a couple of the larger bubbles, but i assume the other ""airy"" areas will become a problem as well.

taz 5 z axis issue.,"every time i try to print using the sd card my z axis binds. this also happens when hooked to my computer but only after 4 or 5 prints. i have been disabling the steppers and leveling it back out, but should i have to do that evertime i print? this is my first printer so i want to make sure im not doing anything wrong to cause the issue. i am using the cura software and the profiles that are on this site to print.



thanks","please read the following if you're also frustrated with a z-axis binding issue. apologies for the long windedness, but if i had read this email i wouldn't have minded the 5-10 minutes it took to read it ...

the above entry from zanthor » thu dec 10, 2015 1:19 pm is basically the correct approach, but was cryptic enough that i missed the meaning the first time around. if you're frustrated with this binding issue like i've been the last 2 days then you may be likely to either screw something up badly (strip threads, bend things, put too much pressure on wire housings, etc) or even decide you need to send your taz to someone to fix. very possible that neither is necessary and, like was true in my case, the solution is likely very simple!

if you need clarification or just some help brainstorming i'm available to email - jahearn@sbcglobal.net

first: make absolutely certain you don't have an incorrect z-axis speed setting! this was twice responsible for all my issues, and since it was impossible to guess at i wasted time working my way through all the other possibilities. if z-axis speed settings are wrong then, as was true in my case, the left z-axis may seem to bind. it's almost impossible to distinguish if the motor is binding because of friction from the rods, or if it's just stalling because speed setting is wrong. my settings to be safe? 200 mm/min. lulzbot also suggests going into the lcd display and doing this: ""configuration"" > advanced settings> then set the v max z to 3 and then back out a step and save the settings.

the other times i had z-axis issues it wasn't related to speed... 

on one occasion the set screws binding the silver coupler to the motor shaft and the threaded rod came loose. be careful with these - the allen wrench provided with my taz 5 sucked and i think the set screws were already a bit compromised when i received my refurbed taz 5. in fact i think the allen wrench caused my problem so i got a new one.

on the other occasions i had binding issues it was clearly due to mis-aligned threaded and/or guide rods. sorry again for the wordiness but i want to be clear as to the circumstances: i've had my taz 5 for several months. printing has been 99% flawless. way beyond expectations wrt detailed prints etc. couldn't be happier. awesome product. but i've had my moments where i crashed the print head into my model or lowered it into the bed with way too much force. twice i've been successful at resolving the issue but twice it all stopped. left z-axis binding. loud noises. complete fail. just when i was ready to take the entire machine apart out of frustration, a friend noticed that one of the threaded z-axis rods wasn't aligned correctly. i mistakenly assumed this meant the threaded rod, the adjacent guide rod, or the metal comprising the frame itself was bent. i also wondered if some of the plastic covers holding it all together were cracked. turns out none of the above was the case. instead the intense forces i put my machine through probably changed the spacing of ""things"" ever so slightly. the fix? loosen screws! yep - take a look around and assess where the stress points are on your machine. don't unscrew the motor from the coupler! (yet. unless nothing else works.) instead, starting with the points of greatest stress on the z-axes loosen those screws first ever so slightly. the first place to start is the z-nut mount (picture of my right z-axis z nut mount attached). with power off and machine unplugged turn silver coupler by hand to see if everything is looser now. do this for almost all points that may have stress involved (exceptions: silver couplers, lower frame brackets - if you loosen these your frame will drop down and then you'll have to take a lot of time to get it back to perfect alignment again). find out just how smooth and easy it is to turn the couplers when they're at their smoothest and easiest. try to get the left and right to be as easy to twist as the other. you may also want to loosen the bolts holding the z-axis motors themselves to the assembly (again don't mess with the coupler though! unless you nothing else works!). 

i want to stress that when i write ""loosen"" i don't mean ""unscrew almost all the way"". i mean just ""loosen"" to where the nuts aren't tight. go too far with the unscrewing thing and you'll have screws falling out as they wiggle their way looser. once you get it all right tighten everything back up. not crazy tight, but tight to where vibrations won't loosen things.

hope this helped. feel free to email if you still need help.

taz6 does not turn of the bed heater at the end of a print,"i had a lulzbot mini, and at the end of a print when the model was presented to me, the bed heater turned off.  it shortly cooled to room temperature.  this is the behavior i expect.

my taz6 also finishes a print and then allows it to cool before presenting it to me (i.e. moving the bed forward).  the problem is that the taz6 bed heater remains on after this.  there is no way to turn it off in cura (none of the head homing or motor-off options have any affect).  even if i could turn the heater off in cura, i'd have to be there when a print finishes.  i sometimes start a print any go do something else.  i return to find that the print finished and the taz might have been sitting with the bed heater on for hours.

what can i change in the taz configuration that will turn off the bed heater when the print finishes?

max temp error when extruder miswired,"i was getting an error stating ""printer stopped due to errors. extruder switch off max temp triggered."" 

i tested the thermister at the connector, it read 120k at room temp.  tested the thermister at the connector for the rambo board, it read as an open.  noticed the wiring colors were different, swapped connectors at extruder, all better.

tl;dr:  when you switch the extruder stepper motor connector and the thermister/hotend heater connector you get a max temp error.

the image is of the underside. came into a birds nest after the hips sunk in and the abs had nothing to attach to.

","this has happened to me many times. it took a while to narrow down. i had at my disposal a thermographic, or ir, camera to help too. i have found it to be an issue with the hips degrading as a function of heat and time. the longer it's at high temperature, the more it degrades. this happens if you print at 240c at 2mm/s as well, then you'll see the yellowing at layers which are printed more slowly than others. the higher the temperature, the less time it takes. it seems to happen more readily with the white hips. the other colors have additives which change the behavior. at first i thought it was my build plate, which although it does have variations of around 25-30 degrees c (taz 6), the main problem was just temperature vs time. the design doesn't help though. the taz 6 has a single temp sensor on the left third, about mid-way to the rear. if you put a part on the sensor, you are in a much cooler region than if you put it on a hot spot. lulzbot should've done a better job designing a heated bed because your printing results already depend on a large variety of variables, now you have to throw ""where on the bed you printed"" into the mix. if your print is large, you can forget it. hips will just degrade, the melting point will drop, and it will no longer even serve the purpose of a good raft. i've tried many brands, even the lulzbot suggested ""village plastics"" hips on their very own website."
taz 5 grinding filament and not extruding material.,edit: solved,"are you talking about the two shiny smooth rods bearing rods?  how ""not level"" are they? do you have a picture you can upload? is one side of the x axis just higher than the other, or are the rods themselves actually bent? if the sides are just not level, you can re-level them by turning the printer off, unplugging the a axis motors, then manually turning the leadscrews until the distance from the bottom of the z leadscrew nut to the top of the z motor mount lower bearing is the same on both sides when measured with calipers. then reconnect the motors and print bed calibration objects and check the bed level at the nozzle with a feeler gauge, etc."
tool head v2.1 fans,"hello,

i am using the tool head v2.1 (comes with three fans one on each side and one on the middle).  only one fan works when i am printing and the rest (two fans) do not work regardless of how big the thing i am printing.  is that normal ?  or may be the cure has to be updated on my pc?

here is the tool head i am talking about:
https://www.lulzbot.com/store/tool-head ... l-head-v21


thanks","the cura filament cooling fan settings are on the advanced tab at the bottom - cool - enable cooling fan
your only choices there are -

fan on at full height
this is your z height where your fan will be turned on to its minimum
percentage setting. especially helpful with high temperature retaining
filaments such as pla. this will be scaled between 0%, and your minimum
fan speed based upon layer height; with it being disabled for the first layer.

fan speed min
this will be the speed your fan runs when enabled at full height. once the
z height is reached for fan on at full height, this will be the speed your
fan runs at.

fan speed max
this is the fastest speed at which your fan will ever run. when your print
speed is slowed down due to minimal layer time, your fan will run between
minimum and maximum speed. the maximum fan speed is reached when
your printer must be slowed by 50% or greater.

the other fan (center) cools the extruder throat. this part needs to remain as cool as possible - heat creep is the enemy here.
the center, throat fan should be on full all the time. cura provides no way to adjust this. you want it on.

pla is too stiff to extrude at the end of finishing a role,"anyone else run into the issue when you get close to finishing a role of pla and you may have one or two prints left in it and when you handle the filament the 3mm is so curled and stiff it practically snaps apart while trying to load it? once i do manage to load it i then notice it is so stiff and curled the extruder has issues pushing it out and just ends up grinding on the filament?

on my taz 6 i have tried cleaning the extruder and changing the tension on the filament with no luck. i just assume at this point since it has now happened to three different roles from three different manufacturers that i just have crazy humility and it is effecting my filament. has anyone else seen this and if so what did you do to fix it?

i hate tossing filament if i can avoid it and i have no room to keep a big plastic tub that is air tight to store my filament. i was thinking i could bake it once it gets stiff but wanted to know first if anyone else had any ideas.","thanks for all the advice! i do currently keep my printer in the house but in a closet that does get a little cool so i will definitely conciser the genius idea of using the 25 watt flood light that fcowell suggested. also nopick thanks for pointing me to a working top load mount for filament as i have considered a few times to move over to that instead of using the tube.  

i was able to fix the issue i had with that role at least and it ended up being two separate issues. one was the brittle pla which i fixed by trying the baking method and baking it for 185 for 2.5 hours and i agree with robajohn that it's not worth the effort but it was the only filament i had in that color and i had a request for that color and didn't want to buy a new roll at that moment. but after i baked it worked like a charm and was more playable. 

second issue i had was a clog and that is not something i have really ran into yet so the warning signs of it slightly extruding but not quite was masked by the brittle pla so i just assumed it was just that. i did some nozzle digging and cold pulling and got it cleaned out and running great again, printing the last bit of that filament.

the one big thing i have learned though is i do need to store my filament better and am moving them to a air tight plastic container with desiccant."
changing machine y-axis home 0,"i did a searching in the manual and didn't find an answer to my question, sorry if it's in there. 

i'm looking to move the y-axis home forward 3-4 mm or so. as of now, the nozzle dropping on the back part of the coin when aligning, worse it's dropping on the edge of the housing of the cleaning strip flexing the table significantly before moving forward and landing on the pad. the machine is brand new and it's been doing this since the first go.","wjl wrote:i've had the exact same problem with a brand new taz 6 i bought last month (december 2016). it seems to have always been off by a few millimeters, which wasn't a big deal, but it was obviously misaligned, since you could see:

* the z-axis homing comes down on the switch noticeably off-center.
* about 5 mm of the cleaning pad never gets touched.
* when auto-bed leveling, it hits the front and back washers in noticeably different spots.

this hasn't really impacted printing or bed leveling, so i mostly have ignored it so far.

however, it actually has gotten gradually worse over the course of moderate daily use for about a month. it has now moved a least a millimeter or two and has just started to nick the cleaning strip housing with the nozzle when cleaning in the last week or so. it makes me wonder if something wasn't quite torqued down enough and it has been slowly moving due to print vibration, etc.


just to follow up for posterity, here is what i did, and the results:

1. z-homed the machine.
2. lifted the z-axis a few millimeters (enough for step 3).
3. measured with the thin plunge end of digital calipers the distance from the center of the z-homing button to where the nozzle actually hit. (i measured a little less than 4 mm).
4. turned off the machine.
5. slowly moved the bed forward to expose the bolts holding the y-axis.
6. ensured the thumbscrews were tight.
7. measured the distance from between the back of the y-axis to the bolt carrier (i measured about 109.81 mm on one side, 109.85 mm on the other -- your measurements might be different depending on where you measure to and from).
8. loosened the bolts -- one set of bolts was noticeably easier to undo -- maybe that is the smoking gun.
9. slowly moved the bed back to expose the other set of bolts and loosened them as well.
10. slowly moved the bed to the front again.
11. carefully pushed the y-axis aluminum chassis rods forward together.
12. measured one side and repeated step 11 until it was where i wanted it (in this case 113.5 mm).
13. screwed the bolts on that side in hand tight.
14. measured the other side and adjusted very slightly as necessary to match the other side.
15. screwed the bolts on that side in hand tight.
16. re-measured both sides (i ended up with 113.52 mm and 113.51 mm).
17. torqued the bolts down to 10 inch-pounds per the spec on the ohai page.
18. slowly moved the bed to the back one last time.
19. tightened & torqued these bolts the same way, ensuring that the measurement on each side stayed the same (since it was only to ensure squareness the number just had to match -- i didn't write down the number).
20. turned it all back on.
21. ran a z-homing.


result: success!

* the z-axis homing comes down as perfectly centered in the y-axis as i can detect visually.
* the cleaning pad now gets touched everywhere except a reasonable ~2 mm on each end.
* when auto-bed leveling, it hits the front and back washers in what looks like exactly the same spots.
* it doesn't nick the wiper holder at all any more.

spool organization ideas,"hey everyone.  now with a few miles (1 year) under belt with my taz, i've got a growing collection of filament spools being collected (various color, material, etc.).   i've got them all packed in poor fitting air tight containers.  it's becoming quiet a mess.   i'm looking for some clever ideas and some inspiration from others.   i have some thoughts, but figured this must be a common problem and would like to tap the collective wisdom of (by nature) a creative group of problem solvers ","i'm still using a 5 gallon plastic bucket with the screw-on lid (mentioned in the post scott linked - more detail on the bucket method and making your own desiccant packs here). a bucket will hold five 1kg spools. 

when our filament storage needs expand, i'll switch to the tupperware container scott is using. note that there are a couple of different sizes of containers that are close, but the one scott found seems to be the best fit for standard 1 kg spools.

btw, i can report that the homemade desiccant packs made from fresh step crystals work very well (see description i linked above). the idea detailed in that thread of weighing them after drying them out is a good one. that way there is no guesswork about whether it's time to dry them back out again."
weird print problem,"so my taz was running fine until i had to replace the head assembly. got the new one with the es stops printed on the front (es856). set the new essteps and stored, then did a 100mm calibration print. 100mm printed out as 100.5. totally acceptable. i tried printing and this happened. with 3 top and bottom layers, the bottom is perfect but the top didn't fill and i got these fish bone looking things on the side. can anyone tell me what is wrong? pulling my hair out trying to get it to print properly again. forgot to mention: petg bed at 60, temp at 235. extrusion multiplyer at 98%. 



","pmenotti67 wrote:set my infill to 50%. still having the problem. any other ideas? it looks like the filament is leaking out of the print head from piece to piece. there are 5 cubes on the bed like the 5 on a die. when it goes from piece to piece, even ith retraction, it seems to be leaking out of the print head. then when it comes to the new piece, it sticks a little on the edge. is my print head bad?i had that exact problem just 3 days ago...  

i opened a brand new roll of esun petg, same as previous roll except for batch#.  suddenly had all those weird growths at the end of long travel moves, using the same gcode that printed perfectly minutes earlier (using the previous roll of petg).   i increased retraction amount and speed, but that didn't help.

exactly as you say, those ""fishbone"" artifacts were being caused by ""oozing"" during the long moves.  i suspected moisture, even though i had just opened the reel which was vacuum-packed with desiccant.  but after a manual extrude, i could see it continue to rapidly ooze and bubble out from the extruder.

i put the entire reel in a 150f oven for 6 hours.  after cooling and retrying -- it printed perfectly, without any of that oozing or artifacts. 

so give that a try....   150f for 4-6 hours should dry out the entire spool.  and of course, always store petg in a sealed container with desiccant or the problem will return!

(addendum...  for the top layer:  petg tends to droop, so you either need denser infill, or more solid layers.)"
taz 6 upgrades and questions,"hi, i'm new to fdm printing and taz 6 is my first fdm printer.  i had a pegasus touch before but it was too messy and inconsistent and i like that i can upgrade a taz as things change.  to that end, i'm wondering what is available for a taz 6.  i read a few comments in a few different threads but i hoped i could get a consolidated list of mods that are available or in the works here.

i've read about an openbuilds x and y (what are the benefits of these over the rods that are stock?)
i've seen mention of extruder upgrades but haven't been able to pinpoint which are taz 6 specific.
i've read that a wobble solution is tough due to space constraints but thinking that maybe a loss of 22 mm of travel might be worth it if the solution could be hotswapped (ie taken off or put back on quickly) when needed for prints that require that extra clean look.  

any help would be greatly appreciated.  this forum is awesome btw.  go take a look at the pegasus touch forum and weep for them....","hi there. i designed the openbuilds mods for the taz 5 and the taz 6. with the taz 6, there is less of a driving need to upgrade the x axis to openbuilds because the 12mm stock taz 6 rods are plenty stiff, and do not experiance droop due to gravity like the taz 5 ones tended to do, leading to an apperent ""hump"" in the middle of the print bed because the head is actually closer to the bed at that point than at the edges. the taz 6 bed rods are still 10mm, so the openbuilds upgrades do help there somewhat. but it requires drilling the bed plate to implement, something that not everyone is comfortable doing.  

the taz 6 openbuilds parts are located here currently: 
viewtopic.php?f=16&t=4908&p=33038&hilit ... lds#p33038
they work with the rest of the openbuilds parts located here: 
http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:866604 

the y openbuilds mod is here: 
http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:949082 

there is no taz 6 z axis modification at this time. 

as far as extruder upgrades go, the taz 6 carriage package is actually really nice. about the only upgrade i would reccommend is one of the taller extruder packages. for example: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1355145 
that allows for a 3rd extruder mounting hardpoint. it does add a bit of carriage mass, but the entire toolhead is more solidly anchored to the top and bottom, which prevents deflection due to nozzle drag in the y axis direction."
layer lines visible - tips for a very large print?,"hi all.   i've just received my taz 6 and love it.... but it's been a challenge dialing it in.  my rocktopus printed fine and my first print went alright as well in ngen, however now i'm printing a life size trex skull (estimated over 30kg of filament) and i'm getting heavy banding in the z axis.  i did have one failed first print that resulted in a huge tangle of filament and that caused the z axis things to bind up as well as the y axis belt to loosen but i tightened it up and relevelled the axis and thing i have that sorted out.  i'm just getting heavy banding with pla  (maybe other filament as well but haven't tried) and it's super ugly.





any thoughts on what i can do to fix?  thanks and i'll be on this forum a whole heck of a lot! looks like a helpful place... much better than my previous 3d printer's forum.","i did a video about it a while back that might be give you more details
http://youtu.be/yokdl-t7lw4 

basically an anti wobble device divorces the x and y motion of the leadscrew from influencing the carriage position, while preserving the exact z axis position the carriage should be at. each time you turn a leadscrew,  the leadscrew nut tends to want to shift slightly to one side due to the angle of the threads in contact and gravity due to the tiny amount of play present between the nut threads and the leadscrew threads, and in thevery case of the taz 5, flex in the x end plate. a bent or malformed leadscrew will increase the presence of wobble. 

two contra rotating leads crews would help combat the issue, but they are somewhat rare. de syncing the leadscrew rotations so that the thread positions are slightly different can sometimes also help. it doesn't always. it also doesn't matter which screw. the downside is that doing do places the bed slightly off level. 

how this all translates into cleaner layer lines is related to whether your printer is experiencing wobble or not. to tell if you have wobble, print something, preferably a cube or a cylendar, then hold it up next to your leadscrew. if there is a layer offset pattern that matches the leadscrew thread spacing, you have z wobble. if it doesn't match it's a different issue. if wobble is present, the anti wobble just prevents the offset force from trying to move the print head, leading to no layer offset. 

a sticking or improperly set up anti wobble can also make wobble worse. 

for the taz 6, you would need to lose a good 22mm worth of print travel to fit one in, which is the main reason there isn't one yet. that or rebuild the x ends. the 6 generally doesn't have wobble because the z rods are better placed than they are on the taz 5. where it is present, there isn't a good permanent fix for it."
infill to perimeter issues,i was never too consumed with my taz print quality until recently. i've been dialing in several materials to get the best results for a while now. i noticed that when my printer moves from the infill to the perimeter on a test cube that it jerks very quickly during that step and makes ridges every so many layers on the corners of cubes. you can see it more on the left side of this image. it's pretty pronounced. this was sliced in s3d. i'm about to run a test in cura to see if it does the same. has anyone seen this and maybe have a solution?,i just printed a cube in cura and this is a s3d slicer issue. off to the s3d forums to post there.   
z-axis noise,"i have had my taz 6 for about 2 weeks now and have been putting it through its paces. over the last few days i have noticed that there is a squeaky/vibration noise whe. the z axis has to travel a bit, like when auto leveling from a higher point. it seems to be coming from the threaded bar on the left side. anyone else experience this?","fbords wrote:piercet wrote:the z motor mount on that side has slid down and will need to be loosened, shifted upwards and re tightened. you will then want to recheck the base level with calipers. the leadscrew should not move that much at all. it may also have a loose motor coupler.

well that's a lot more work than i was hoping for after just having this for a couple of weeks. how's lulzbot support's tolerance for helping me fix whatever i may break when trying to fix these?

it's under warranty, if you call support they will probably have you box it up and send it back and send you a new one. if you don't want to wait, sliding the motor mount block up is an easy and time efficient solution."

print temperature: 255
layer height .45

thanks
lee","if i am not mistaken that is a thermal runaway error meaning the machine basically lost track of the temperature. 

assuming it appears to work properly most of the time (after the error happened) i would check all the wiring from the thermistor to the board. hook the machine up to your computer so you can monitor the temperature and wiggle the wiring along the path and see if it spikes of drops (you can do this at room temperature).

it's likely the wire to the thermistor has come loose or been pinched at some point (also check the plugs).

just another note, .45 layer height is very high, are you using a .6mm nozzle or larger? if not that's too high."

"is this ""normal""?","hello, i had noticed a few things yesterday when troubleshooting another issue and wanted to see if this is just normal wear and tear. this is my first 3d printer so i want to set my expectations properly.

the big green gear on the extruder of my taz 6 has some wear marks (slightly lighter color deep in the gear teeth) and there is a some green dust on the toolhead carriage. does this just happen over the course of regular use, or is something wearing incorrectly? aside from having some temperamental filament, everything extrudes properly and i can't hear anything i would consider unusual. 

pics: https://imgur.com/a/t2kpl

also, when the filament retracts during a print, the gear makes a fairly loud clicking sound when it changes direction rapidly. is that normal as well? i noticed this when i had my retract speed setting set to 15mm. aside from the sound, it looks to be retracting properly as a lot of the stringing issues i had have subsided.

lastly, the hot end has some gunky build up that looks like it's from the sheathing of the red wire melting a bit since it is touching the hot metal. this started within the first couple of prints. is that anything to be worried about, or do i just need to give the nozzle a good clean?

thanks again. i'm just looking to figure out what is to be expected and what is a problem.","oh, that's not too difficult. basically you just loosen the 4 bolts holding the extruder motor to the extruder body and back it off slightly. like maybe 1/10th of a mm."
'bad' accuracy of finished parts,"i don't know weather to put this is the hardware or software section. 

i have a pretty new taz 6 that i really love overall.  however, my finished parts have sloppy tolerances. if i draw a part say 2 millimeters thick it can come out anywhere up to 2.29 mm thick.  if i draw a slot 2.2 mm wide to accept the 2 mm part it could come out as narrow as 1.5 mm.  sometimes it comes out right but 90% of the time i need to trim and cut every part and slot.  it gets very frustratrating. 

i am using verbatim pla and the built in settings in cura. i never use the ""speed"" setting and the difference (as regards this problem) between standard and high detail is marginal. if i use ""high detail""  i may not have to trim by hand as often but i still have to trim most of the time.   

so am i expecting too much? is .5 mm tolerances to much to ask? is this the machine or cura?  

perhaps i need to totally rethink my designs but i have had the same problem with every interlocking method i have tried   

this and variations of it are are what i am trying to do. 








","it sounds like you're using the default settings. if you want parts that are very accurate, you need to calibrate the printer. there are a lot of threads around the forum, but i'd start with these to see if you get closer. note you will need the expert settings in cura. 

filament diameter. measure this with calipers/micrometer and enter it in cura. every filament is a little different. 
extruder idler tension. set it so there is about 5mm between the washers to start with. 
extruder e-steps. 
z-offset. make sure the first layer is exactly the height you asked for. 
first layer extrusion amount, this is set high by default. dial it back to 100%. 

start with known calibration parts like the simple 20mm cubes. make one change, test, repeat until you get that setting dialed in. and note you might have to adjust temperature etc. when you change colors etc.. usually not a lot, but it's good to know."
"taz 6 - whats your ""workhorse"" filament?","hi all,
we have just received our shiny new taz 6! i was wondering what filament you would recommend for day-to-day use? we have had a makerbot rep 2 (boo hiss right!?) in the lab for a few years, and we had the most consistent ""print and forget"" reliable results with pla (particularly the darker colours) with the makerware defaults. 

we fully intend to start messing with weird and wonderful filaments and pushing the new machine to its limits, but when you guys/gals *aren't* doing that and just want something ~0.5 kg to just print ok, what filament do you use? i was thinking it might be 2.85 mm pla from a reputable supplier, but seeing as the first print rocktopus was in ngen i wasn't so sure anymore.

thanks!","when i want accuracy i have gotten to like gizmo dorks. it is 2.85 mm +/- .05 mm.  but that was not your question!  

i am printing things 5 foot long (in pieces of course) so when i am printing big and don't expect great accuracy, i really like excelvan pla from ebay. i can get it for as little as 6 dollars a kg but have never paid over $8- there are caveats

1) you get two colors on a roll at 1/2 kg a piece. i have found the red-white prints really smooth and shiny.  (blue and yellow is not bad but the blue is very dull in color. 
2) i have never found a roll yet that was 2.85. it can vary as much  +/- .15 and i usually end up averaging it in cura about 2.93 to 2.95. 

did i mention $6-8 a roll!   

in fact, you can see parts in all four colors i have tried here (scroll down a bit)

white village mills abs clicking sound???,"hello,
i've had my taz 6 since may. i have only printed about a 2 dozen objects using only village mills abs from lolzbot.com 
i've used orange, and red with little to no problems. i loaded some white village mills abs and noticed about once every 50 sec to 1 min the extruder head has a clicking sound coming from it. i tried different z settings but it made no difference. i removed the white filament and reloaded it . . .still made the clicking sound. i loaded the orange i used a few months ago and it is working fine. i measured the white filament with my calipers and it measured 2.85 mm.  does anyone have any ideas what the clicking sound could be coming from? will it hurt my extruder to use the white filament? it wasn't printing the best prints the small object i let it finish. thanks for any advice. maybe i need a different abs white filament??? discouraged because i was printing parts for my race quadcopter . . ..  needed white.

ugggggghhhh.... now the orange abs filament is clicking about once every 1 min from the extruder.","thank you, i will give that a try tomorrow. there are so many things to learn about 3d printing and each machine is so unique."
new taz 6 owner,"well - i just took the plunge and picked up my first 3d printer! a refurbished taz 6 from itworks3d.com. i will do my best to search the forums first for my noob questions before i start shooting off a bunch of starter questions here.  

i researched a bunch of printers (wow - are there are a bunch of 3d printers now) but kept coming back to this brand. my other choice was the original prusa i3 mk2 because of the cheaper cost and similar print quality but in the end... i thought it was worth it to support a locally based company here in the us.

i model in cinema 4d and zbrush so...i will be trying to get up to speed on how to get those converted over to .stl while waiting on the printer to arrive. if you have any of those ""oh i wish i had known that when i first started"" pearls of wisdom... it would be much appreciated. ","wow... that is a rocking list piercet!! thanks...good stuff for sure. going to take me a little while to digest it all. 
piercet wrote:hi there, welcome to the taz club! 

lets see, wisdom pearls huh? ok. 
1. room temperature has a dramatic effect on 3d printing. if you can print fine one day, and the next you have issues with the same settings but it's 5 degrees colder, it's not your settings, it's the weather. also 3d printers cannot live in a cold garage without an enclosure. 
2. cheap filament is worse than no filament. especially when you are just learning, get good quality name brand filament from a reputable manufacturer. village plastic or push plastic both make great stuff. you can experiment with lower quality stuff once you know how the printer will react to good filament. cheap filament often has less plastic and more filler powder in it, leading to brittle and hard to print parts. 
3. you will go through your first roll of filament very quickly and waiting for shipping is a pain, order two. 
4. when swapping filament from a hotter material (abs) to a colder material (pla) you have to heat the nozzle up to the hotter temperature to purge the remaining plastic, run a 15-20mm extrusion at that temperature to get the last of it out,  then let it cool back down to print temperature . 
5. nozzles very rarely clog. i've seen an actual legitimate clog from foreign material (a piece of broken brass from a nozzle thread) exactly once. it's almost always something else, either trying to extrude too close to the bed (the equivalent of attempting to spray cheese wiz through a brick wall), parts lifting from the bed causing them to be too close to the nozzle during the print, or overextrusion
6. make sure you measure your filament diameter with verneir calipers (and get a set of decent digtal ones, you will use them often) and then make sure that measurement is in your slicing program (likely cura) the slicing program comes with a default diameter already specified, usually 2.85mm. depending on the filament, that actual diameter will likely range from 2.6mm up to 3.12mm. it becomes very important to have that number correct because otherwise you get over or under extrusion. think of it like an order for a brick wall made of 6 bricks. if you tell the wall builder (the extruder) you have 6 bricks, but you actually only have 5 bricks (equivalent to a filament diameter setting of 2.60mm when you have it set to 2.85mm) you end up one brick short and your wall has a big hole in it. that right there is the biggest thing people miss when they first start out printing. 
7. print abs on a taz at 240 degrees for the nozzle and 110 for the bed as a starting point. 230c is too cold and it will split. 
8. purchase a good part removal tool. if you pull things up from the bed too hard, you will get bubbles on your pei sheet, which then act as insulators preventing parts from sticking. it is important to wedge parts away from the pei gently using something like a paint scraper, or a spatula. i personally use a caphalon gadgets cheese wedge with the slicer part taped over. 
9. you will read about using abs juice or blue painters tape or whatnot to keep things attached to the bed. you can ignore most of that with the taz pei sheet until you get into advanced materials like ninjaflex rubber, etc. 
10. pla plastic requires fan to print properly. abs plastic usually requires no fan to print properly. the exceptions being when printing very small layers or when ""bridging"" or running a length of extrusion from one layer over a gap to another layer. the barrel cooling fan on the taz extruder should be on full time regardless of what type of plastic you are printing. if you are printing pla, it tends to expand when it gets warm. if that fan isn't running, it can expand just enough to wedge itself into the bore of the extruder, causing ""bore lock"" which looks very much like a jam. if you are printing pla and start to see a bunch of jams, check that fan first. 
11. the idler arm tension bolts should be tightened down to have about 7mm worth of spring between the washers on either side of the spring as a good starting point. pla requires a bit less, abs may want a bit more. 
12. we were all new to this once. if you have a question, feel free to ask. someone here will probably have an answer. 

happy printing!"
"i'll admit it, i like em small.","here's my second attempt at really really small. 






this was printed in abs with a 0.15mm nozzle and a 0.04mm layer height.  i printed two at once to help with cooling.  the first attempt i made failed due to not enough cooling between layers.  the total height of the rook is 1/2"", or 12.7mm (197 layers).  the two are sitting on top of a dime.  i think with a little work, i could get a better result.  note, you can see the double helix through the door of the rook on the left.  i don't think the double helix was successful all the way up, and it's so small, i can't tell how well the spiral staircase came out.  still, it's a small step in the right direction.

the machine is a kittaz upgraded to a taz 5 and then with two other mods.  i added a micrometer stop for adjusting z height, and i converted to a 1.75mm hexagon hotend. 

if i can get the quality improved at this size, i'll have to start playing around with my 0.10mm nozzle!

dual extruder with water-soluble filament,"hi all - i have been watching/researching this forum for a while and i think i am ready to order a taz 6 today (my first 3d printer... so total noob) and i had one quick question. i have been reading about the water-soluble filaments that are available. down the road, if i upgrade to a dual extruder will i be able to make use of this technique? is it supported with the taz 6 using a dual extruder? since i am just starting out... i think the single will be fine to learn with but love the idea upgrading in the future and being able to do the more complicated prints using that technique if it is capable of that. 

thanks,
tony b.","hi there, welcome to the forum!

the short answer to your question is yes, you could use water soluable support. the problem is that most of the water soluable fillaments are basically useless and prone to failure with any moisture in the air. they leave a much worse surface than just plastic support would, and there are very few cases where it doesn't cause more problems than it fixes. it's not so  much that water soluable fillament is an issue for a taz, it's more that it just doesn't work very well on any printer. same thing with using hips and limoene, etc. you will find that you get the most use for a dual extruder by making either multi color objects, or multi material items (a ninjaflex rubber printed socket with an embedded abs flange arm for example, or a rigid structure with different material types to make it flex in different patterns at different stress or heat points) 

hope that helps!"
z-axis binding/grinding (even with no power and level z),"my taz 6 originally came with a wierd z axis issue and support was awesome and send me some of the gray z axis coupler's for free.

the issue:

when i attempt to move the z-axis the left z-axis motor (nearest electronics) binds/grinds and won't move.  if i disconnect the power cord from the left z axis motor it's very smooth.  i've leveled the z-axis using a pair of digital calipars.  another thing to note, i cannot move the z-axis at all through the lcd interface.  cura only.  my firmware is 1.0.2.19.  also, once in awhile it will work fine, raise/lower perfect;  i'll reset the machine and it will now start to bind.  this is without printing anything, just a simple reboot goes from ok to binding (without me even touching any part of the machine)

what i've tried

reset to factory settings in the lcd.
leveled z-axis multiple times
squared the machine according to the docs
adjusted the ""z-nut"" on the black cones.  i tightened each one all the way and then backed them out a 1/4 turn
aligned and tightened the set-screws on the z-axis couplers
removed the left z-axis motor and verified that it worked fine under no-load (it did)

i'm at a loss.  any ideas?","it's a taz 6, it's still under warranty, you're going to want to call support. 

that being said, the most likely causes of z binding are as follows: 
1. loose or broken motor to leadscrew couplers on one or more sides of the z axis. check for loose or missing setscrews top and bottom. each coupler should have 4 setscrews, two of the 4 should be alligned with the flat spots on the motor shaft and the leadscrew shaft. 
2. check that the z motor mounts are slid far enough up the frame. both leadscrews should be at the top of the upper leadscrew bearing, there should be no difference in poisition, and lifting up on the x end / z carriage section should not move the motion segment. if it does move, slide the loose z motor mount up until it is in solid contact and the leadscrew has no play, but is not binding. 
3. if the z carriages are too far offset, the auto leveling cannot compensate and the z travel will bind. check the distance from the bottom of the cone to the top of the center of the lower z leadscrew bearing, those distances should both be identical. 
4. it is possible that the x rods are either pulling the z carriage ein, or pushing it out too far. you can loosen the x belt, then unbolt the idler side x rod mounts and run the z carriage up and down several times. if you observe no binding, lock the mount bolts back down, re tension the belt and try to print again. 

5. if it isn't any of those things, it may be electrical, posibly a loose wiring harness, or a faulting rambo motor chip. you will want to call support."
layers not smooth taz 6,"hi,

i'm trying to print a part in lulzbot taz 6, but the layers don't seem to be coming out right, on one side the layers come out perfectly, but on the other side there is 



. i was wondering if anyone here could enlighten me on how to fix this, or what might be causing the issue in the first place. i doubt that it has anything to do with the room temperature, as the temp is around 31 degrees celsius. the object was positioned with the good side facing towards you and the bad side facing away from you, every time the side that did not have a smooth layer was the side that was facing away from you. the material that i'm using is abs, the printing temperature is 240, and the bed temperature is 111. the bed temperature is 111 to compensate for the approximate 1 degree loss in temperature when the bed moves. 



this is the entire part and how it was positioned on the bed.

second: based on your explanation, i still can't tell  which was the x or y axis, but it kind of looks like your abs is binding up on the reel. 

third: looks like some over extrusion in the corners. 

is this printed with cura using base settings for abs?

it looks like you have a few different problems.

"taz 6, extruder v2.1, clogging after 2-3 layers","i have a taz 6 printer. it has been rock solid for the past 9 months or so that i have had it. however over the past couple weeks the x-axis drivers on the rambo board went bad. i thought it was the motor. but i moved the motor to the y-axis motor and it worked. so i ordered and replaced the rambo board and installed it in the taz 6. i went through the calibration documentation on the lulzbot website. ran the .050 extruder calibration and everything was fine. all the motors are functional, it auto levels, and the nozzle extrudes 100mm of material in the calibration.

then i started to print, using lulzbot 3mm black abs. i used the abs standard profile in the cura v20. the printer used to run with this profile just fine. i tried to print the rocktopus on the sd card calibration directory and i get the picture below. after 2-3 layers the plastic stops coming through the nozzle. 






the next picture shows that the printer continues to try and deliver the plastic and strips the plastic since it is stuck. 






i have double and triple checked the wiring of the rambo board against the assembly manuals. i have also removed the nozzle and cleaned all the plastic out of it and reinstalled it. but the same problem continues to occur. just as a note the extruder head is also brand new because of a fault on the original (that one is in repair with lulzbot but i didn’t want to be down while it was being fixed).

don't know where to go next on this one.","if you have just swapped out extruders, you  are going to want to double check your z offset. each tool head will sit slightly differently, and can be adjusted through the lcd screen.

looking at the photos, it appears the nozzle is a little close on the first layer. this will cause added back pressure, and allow your hobbed bolt to slightly slip. this will collect more filament as the print progress, until a full strip out occurs.

backing your z offset off will allow more room for extrusion, preventing the back pressure, and allow a successful print.

through the lcd screen go to configuration > advanced settings > z offset > clockwise rotation > (click the wheel to save settings)

you can also make this adjustment while the print is laying down it's first layer, and it will change on the fly.

we hope this helps!"
12mm igus linear bearing issue,"hey guys,

recently bought a pair of 12mm rods from itworks3d and 12mm igus bearings from lulzbot and the bearings were almost impossible to get on the rail, and once on the rail were not sliding like the similar 10mm ones i have. this is not an alignment issue with the x carriage its just the single bearing and rail. 

is there a way to file down the bearing or some other method to give the bearing some ease of motion? i have an x axis that basically wont be able to move due to the friction/press fit of the bearing.

taz 6 print shifting,when printing it shifting on the y-axis on our lulzbot taz 6. it shifts back and forth a few times throughout the print only on the y-axis. we are using cura version 21.00 and the taz 6 profile. the belts were tight and it was auto centered before hand. any suggestions?,"frc5837 wrote:is there a way to manually speed up the fan in the electronics portion of the taz 6?

(note: hotend not included)

looks like the motor mount assembly mounts to a standard nema 17.  the motor - driveshaft coupler is printed.  i would have prefered a metal coupler.  from what i can discern, you have to figure out how to mount the motor to the printer and mount the extruder to the carriage yourself since they do not offer a lulzbot specific version.  with the weight savings, the dual extruder looks interesting too.  


i'll be sure to do a thread if i get one.

y carriage support,"i just received my taz 6. during setup i noticed that all four rubber feet on the y carriage are about 4mm off the table surface. is this normal?

i have confirmed that the carriage is properly seated in the frame. either the feet are too small or the feet on the main frame are too big.","that was an intentional design choice. there are ways to un-design it though. adhesive furniture sliders work well, or a longer m3 cap head bolt and some washer s under the flexy feet."
taz 6 grinding / cannot move up on z,"so... just unboxed my shiny new taz 6, following the unboxing and setup directions very careful and was very excited and everything went well til i hit the print button... it moved everything around like it was going to tap the first button to calibrate before hitting the edges, and had no issues at all moving around or moving down, and then it got very close (few mm away) and then began to grind.  badly.  i was using cura 19.12 and trying to print the first print rocktopus.

after cancelling/shutting off motors once or twice, i finally determined that trying to move up in the z axis was the issue.  i haven't tried moving down because it's very close to the bed, and x/y work just fine both directions.  

i made a video showing it moving properly in the x/y directions but grinding when i tried to move the z up -- (at the beginning and end) of the video: https://youtu.be/6tiym5v8paa

the xyz coordinates on the front of the taz show that it think it's moving in the z direction, but obviously, it's not.  i did email tech support but it was right after they were gone for the weekend, apparently.

i saw this thread about the mini: viewtopic.php?f=36&t=4482 but i don't understand a lot of what they're talking about and since it moved down without issue, i'm not convinced it's the same thing.

amazingly frustrated would be an understatement... if anyone has suggestions or thoughts, i'd love to hear them.

thanks","i think i have the same problem. i heard a slight grinding noise from the z-axis right from the beginning. i started the first print and it went ok until it started the nozzle cleaning. it missed the felt pad by 10mm in the x-axis. then the nozzle melted through the felt pad holder and the tool head got stuck. when i tried to drive it upwards i just heard the grinding at it didn't move. out of the box the printer wasn't perfectly stable on its 4 feet on my table so i think the frame wasn't square.

i removed the tool head and tried to square the frame. however the frame was not even close to being square when i aligned the aluminium extrusions flush as per the instructons. right now i can see by eye that it's not square. should i just try to make it square and ignore the flushness?

what should i do about the wiping process missing the pad?"
taz5 z-axis jams/stutters on print start or z homing,"have a taz5 that, other than right when i try to start a print, works fine/prints fine. had it for around a year now, but this issue has just started ocurring. whenever i try to home z axis (or start a print, which homes the z axis), it will typically start screeching, stuttering, and often just jam up completely causing the motors to whine horribly until i power it off. happening more and more frequently over the past few days. lubed threaded rods, checked for loose parts, everything seems fine that i have thought to check.

changed the start g-code line in cura from:
g1 z15.0 f{travel_speed}                   ;move the platform down 15mm

to:
g1 z15.0 f{5}                   ;move the platform down 15mm

which effectively gets around the problem and allows me to print. travel speed used to be 175 or 150 i think, can't remember; i've since moved it down to 100 in a previous attempt to fix this problem. still happens at 100.

can still print fine with the start g-code change, i don't really care that it takes a few extra seconds to move up 15 mm at the start, but i'd prefer to figure out whats going wrong before i can no longer get it to move properly at low speeds as well.","hello ice,

you will need to raise your tool head off of the bed (if it is off the bed, go straight to the measurements). then measure from the metal plate under the heat bed to the bottom of the x carriage guide rails. if either side you measure is higher then the other disable your stepper motors from the lcd display. then adjust the side that is higher to be equal to the other side. you can do this by turning the silver coupler that attaches the motor to the threaded rod.
once you have done this, go to configuration (or control), then select advanced settings, then select v max z and move it to 3, then go back one screen and click ""store memory"" to save the change.

anyone grease the taz 6 z-axis lead screws?,"has anyone ended up putting grease on the ball screws of the taz 6? i know earlier generations had it but they went away from it for this version.

swap one (flexy) extruder out of the flexydually with stock v2.1 possible?,"hi!
with a new taz 6, the stock extruder is a ""lulzbot taz single extruder tool head v2.1"", as far as i can tell.
i am considering to get a flexydually and replace the flexy part of it:

i would like to have a normal ""lulzbot taz dual extruder tool head v2"" (non-flexy for abs + pva support) and a flexystruder. but i would not like the original tool head to lie around uselessly.

it seems not too difficult to swap the flexy part of a flexydually with the stock v2.1 extruder body, so as to end up with a ""dual"" and a ""flexystruder"". ideally, i assume that i just change the upper part (including the extruder body + gears, but without the stepper motor) and i'm set.

i would just like to confirm to be 100% sure: is the hot-end the same in the flexydually and the tool head v2.1?

thanks for the info!!","just need to use the dual extruder v2 firmware.  but i'm not sure what dependencies the nozzle diameter has on the firmware... i don't think there are any.  just make sure your slicer settings are correct.

personally, i'd print a modified wade's extruder body that allows for printing flexible filament... and get the dual extruder.  keep the hardware from your single as spares.

i attached my version of the body (shared only on the forums), but piercet has a version which improves the stiffness for faster printing... its on thingiverse, but i can't seem to find it."
constant extrusion failures,"the initial month or two, the prints have been fantastic with no extra effort to get them working. however, over the last week i haven't been able to get a successful print. this print failure seems to be because the primary extruder fails to feed. 

i observed this during one of the early layers on a really long print where the extruded ngen filament began to ""sputter"" instead of printing a solid line.  so while it was still printing i released the filament from the extruder and pulled out the filament. a portion of the filament appeared to be carved out. after trimming the damage portion, i re-inserted it into the extruder assembly and it was printing fine. this morning it looks like a similar problem had happened.  

i'm printing ngen with the standard settings with the nozzle at 230c bed at 85c which has always worked before. 

under the cool heading in the advanced settings the fan is configured as the following:
fan full on height 6mm
fan speed min 40%
fan speed max 60%
min speed 10 mm/s


since it's colder outside, should i be running the filament at 5c or 10c hotter than normal?

system: taz 6
extruder: dual v2.1","something that helps me in 3d printing and in all problem solving generally is to ask ""why?"" 5 times

i had a similar issue start happening recently and here is how it went for me:

filament is grinding out.  why?
filament is not being pressed against the hobbed bolt hard enough.  why?
idler roller mounting feels wobbly but adjustment screws are in usual location.  why?
idler roller bracket has a crack in it by the bolt thus relieving pressure on the hobbed bolt.

of course there may be dead ends but at each step just think of other causes for the step above. and always check obvious things first--don't get exotic....the proverbial ""is it plugged in"" is a good one for electronics....

of course there are other potential things like binding of filament that causes the hobbed bolt/motor to work too hard, appearance of purging the nozzle--is heat/heater/thermistor working all the time?  etc.

taz 6 reboots manually loading filament,"hi there...in what seems like an ever growing list of issues with my 6 in the process of loading filament to run a 3dbenchy gcode file lulzbot support sent me the machine rebooted in the process of doing so. the steps are reproducible, here's what i did, curious if anyone else's machine does it. i have video of it and will post the vimeo link. i apologize in advance that i ended up turning my phone sideways to show the display and toolhead at the same time so you'll have to turn your head. 

also, i've had odd behavior, for example, while moving the z axis up to 240 (per lulzbot support instructions as part of an x carriage alignment test) i've had the toolhead move to the right by itself, and i've also had the display crap out as shown in the picture below. when i told lulzbot about the issue they replied that it is normal and built-in protection for the lcd from turning the knob too far and to instead turn it a little, then wait, then turn it a little, then wait... that sounds like bs to me.

here's the video of it rebooting: https://vimeo.com/196106831



 display corrupt 


thanks for any suggestions.","dougz wrote:hi piercet. who would have thunk it. but, what about the manual extrude issue in the video, is that the same thing and it caused the machine to reboot?
if so it seems silly, honestly.

that particular reboot might have been caused by your hand position and the less than ideal placement of the primary power switch, which is on a hair trigger. it didn't look like you were turning the knob too fast, but it does look to me like your hand was in contact with the power switch and it takes almost no force to interrupt the power temporarily on that style of switch.  you may want to repeat the experiment with your hand away from the switch and see if it occurs again. mine do not do that from the lcd alone,  though the wire path on mine does go a different route and use a different firmware."
want smoother bottom with abs,"hi all,
i am new to 3d printing and have a taz 6 using cura.
the filament is ic3d abs. it is 2.85mm and that is what i have inputted.

trying all sorts of different settings, i cannot seem to get a smooth bottom layer.
i have tried many adjustments, including bottom thickness, layer0 width factor, layer height, and many other things.

the attached picture of 3dbenchy shows what i mean.

i have seen other who use abs and the bottom layer seems to flow much better and the individual lines seem the melt together more.

can anyone point me in the right direction?

thanks,
darren","in cura it depends on the model taz you have due to the firmware differences. for the taz 6, it's missing in cura and you can only use the control panel. it might be due to bed leveling, but i'm not sure why its not in the cura interface. it's present in cura if you have a taz 5 or below on the main print screen. there is a setting for it in simplify3d though. probably others.

you can also store your z-offset setting in the firmware but going up a level in the menu and choosing save. you really probably only need to adjust it when changing to a significantly different filament type."
my printer just caught on fire.,smoke started pouring out of the electronics box in between prints.  waiting for it to cool down before i investigate further.  anything like that happen to anybody?  it's been fine for almost two years.,"that's your heated been wire harness. i'm guessing there is a short or a loose wire there or possibly in the wire harness that leads from the control box to the bed. you can see how it looked prior to that here

https://ohai.lulzbot.com/project/56d485 ... 7b2/taz-4/

i do wonder if your heated bed might have a loop burned out which happens sometimes.  you can get the heated bed wire harness from itworks3d.com.  if it were me, i would replace the bed with a taz5 spec bed with the pei sheet to be safe along with the harness wire.

bulging when the nozzle makes a sharp turn,"i am trying to dial my taz 6 for about a week now and there is two things i can't seem two fix small ridging on the walls and bulging when the nozzle takes a sharp turn. i will leave the ridging issue for another post but here is a good example of the bulging issue:


i am slicing with simplify3d at a .2mm layer height and both prints printed 4 layers before i canceled the print so you can ignore the extra extrusion found at the top left of each corner as that is just the extruder stopping mid print and pulling off the print. 

but if you look at the right print you can see a little bulging near the inside of the perimeter wall as the nozzle turns to make another diagonal line across the middle of the print. i didn't think much of it but then when i changed the internal fill pattern from rectilinear to concentric i really noticed the bulging as it made this x shape bulging at each bend as it prints a bunch of squares till it fills in the middle.

i have played with so many settings, calibrated the hardware to the best of my abilities and googled around with little to no luck and getting a flat print. 

i don't think it is an over extrusion issue because i still saw it happen when i set the extrusion multiplier to 85% and you could see gaps between the line but still would see bulging on the corners. 

has anyone see this before and has some thoughts?","you hit the head on nail, i thought i covered testing speed but i must have done that before i found the concentric fill pattern. i changed the default print speed setting to 1000 at first from the default 3600 mm/min. 

i could tell instantly the corners were looking way better so then i set it back to default and started to play with your suggestion of looking at the under speed percentage for solid infill. i cranked it down from 80% to 30% and it was about as much as i wanted to tolerate. here is the results:



from left to right: default print speed 1000, under speed percentage 30%, under speed percentage 80%

broken print bed help!,"hello all,

i operate three taz 5's in my classroom, and try to keep the kids as engaged as possible (which inevitably leads to more repairs). recently, we had a project adhere way to well to the print bed. in efforts to get it off, the bed shattered. any advice on how to replace the glass? i have the replacement part, but i definitely want to get the removal of the heater pad correct. 

any suggestions?","stick it in the freezer. that will reduce the adhesion of the bed heater significantly and theoretically allow you to peel it off. go slow, wear gloves, and do not force it. there are thin copper wires inside, if you pull them too hard the wires break and you buy a new bed heater. the top pei surface should come off the same way. 

if you find you absolutly cannot remove it by pulling even with the freezer trick, you can use a citrus based glue remover to remove the heater. this will leave a residue that you absolutly must remove from the heater before attempting to re-attach it. while normally not the best idea for cleaning rubber, several cleanings with a glass cleaner containing ammonia such as windex will probably remove the oils. that may damage the rubber over time, but at that point you probably don't have much choice. you would then wash the surface with isopropyl alchohol several times to remove any remaining windex residue, then use a high temperature contact cement to re-apply the silicone rubber heater."
did anyone ever get their machine to work?,"i never got my lulzbot to work so instead of it being a large paperweight, i dismantled it for parts

taz 6 extruder mount cracked and broke,"just wanted to know if anyone else has had issues will the stock extruder on the taz 6 loading filament and finding it gets stuck where the extruder mount/guide meets the metal hotend (hope i used the right terminology). i didn't think much of it and thought it was normal and you just needed to give it a little force to get it past that part. well over time i noticed extrusion of filament got worse and inconsistent to the point it would not even feed.  

took the extruder assembly apart and found the 3d printed mount was cracked in two places where the bolts screwed into the aluminum plate. i took off the bolts and barley touched the ends on the mount and they fell off. i assumed the cause of the crack was due to the stress of pushing in the filament combined with the heating and cooling around the part. 



i have abs glued the parts back together and even have a new mount on order from itwork3d, shout out to jamie and his store for always bending over backwards for his customers. i called his store since they didn't currently carry the part and within hours he had it up on the site and i was able to get it ordered!

this brings up a few questions for me:

1. has anyone ran into this as well and if so have any idea what may have caused it? 

2. i would like to print a new mount in a different filament to avoid this from happening again do you think nylon would be the best fit?

3. any tips on making sure there is a smooth transition of the filament from the feeder portion into the metal hot end?","you may want to check out the reinforced taller extruder body. http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1355145 

i also have a reinforced extruder mount, but it works best for abs printing, if you are printing mostly pla you may want to stick with the stock mount design. 

the hobbed bolt is essentially indestructible, and can be cleaned with a small pick, or a tiny flat head screwdriver. open the idler chamber, then clean any residue you can see on the bolt, rotate it a bit more to get the rest, etc. it is not possible to have worn it out. you will want to check the state of the bearings. the taz 6 used nice sealed bearings for the idler and extruder 608zz bearings, so they shouldn't be gummed up. you'll want to make sure the idler bearing in particular still turns properly. also check that the filament hole in the extruder body lines up with the deepest part of the hobbed bolt ground out notch. if it is offset, move the large 8mm washers around front to back until it lines, up, potentially adding or removing washers to get a good fit. i've found that adding a particularily thin 8mm washer to the front gear stack often helps get perfect alignment there. 

you will also want to make sure the idler arm tension bolt springs are tight enough. they should have around 7mm distance between the washers on either side of the spring on both bolts. if the filament is still gouging out, tighten them a  bit more. if you are still having issues after that, you may be experiencing a thermistor or heater core issue with your hotend and will want to check and verify the temperatures it is operating at. a partially failing thermistor will report that it has reached a higher temperature than the heater core is actually at, causing the printer to sometimes extrude plastic at lower temperatures than you have it set, which in turn puts more strain on the extruder and can lead to issues."
layers not lining up,"hello everyone, i'm very new to 3d printing and it's been going fairly well, but i'm suddenly having an issue.

anyone know what could be causing this?",that is most likely a loose x axis belt. it's also possible that it is a loose x axis motor pulley or possibly an issue caused by an overheating rambo board if the printer is in an enclosure that isn't vented properly and or has a failing enclosure fan or heat sink.

bonus question

the layers view show the messed up skirt -


any ideas about why this is happening?



best regards, 
pch","i can't 100% tell from the photos but when i had petg loaded (think it's my fave material now!) i had some what i thought to be stringing issues, turns out petg can be pulled like hot sugar.  i'm wondering if the blob elements you describe at the infill are part of that issue.  i can see some stringing in the photo so here's how i would describe the difference for petg.

""thicker"" stringing, this is the nozzle set too low in temp by only a few degrees, where the strings put up a bit of resistance to breaking when pushed by your finger and when doing long curves you get a little bit of a layer popping loose.  this is not a retraction thing.

""ultra fine"" stringing, almost hair like, very little resistance to breaking think ultra fine fibre like a strand of very fine synthetic hair, could move around in a light breeze.  this means your temp is likely right and just need to play with retraction a little bit if excessive.

other issues per the other great comments in this thread."
taz 5 - nozzle temp not set with gcode,"i've been loving my taz 5 for over a year and a half now without much issue beyond user. recently though i have an issue finally....

when i export gcode to the sdcard from cura 21, it does not set the nozzle temp on the taz anymore. i thought commenting out the gcode would work for the temp settings but instead it just wants to immediately print before it heats up. before it used to register the temp setting in cura and would heat up until that point. 

i've flashed the firmware with marlin 1.0.0.1 which was already installed and working just fine. again, i uncommented the temp settings as a thoughful fix in cura for the gcode about bed and nozzle temp but that made situations worse.

thoughts?","so then what you're saying is my taz 5 has been broken for 1.5 years now and finally now it just started working? that can't be the case. 

i just realized maybe we're not on the same page, i'm using cura to export to gcode which is saved to the sdcard. not sure how else you could print from an sdcard though.....

i have always been able to print directly from my sdcard within the panel's option ""print from sdcard"" using the gcode stored on the sdcard and it will then set the nozzle and bed temp. it will then say it is heating until it is completed. it also has always set the temps to the gcode setting, not the abs setting on the printer. this is with 2-3 different firmware versions since i've had this unit. 

i can override the temp with the abs setting after i choose to print, or i can set the abs temp before i choose to print then i can print from the sdcard and it will then change to the temp setting in there.

that's how it used to all work. now my only option is to manually set the temp then print."
hot end temp offset by 25 c?!,"so i have been messing around with the e3d titan extruder, but i have not gotten very good results.  this led me into inspecting the temperature of my hot end.  i used a k type thermocouple to measure the heater block at various locations and the heating element itself.  the heater block varied as you moved around it, which is to be expected, but i was reading low values.  so, i probed the heating element and found it to be 25 c below the set point and temperature reported by octoprint (or any other management software).  i have a couple different heads for my taz 5 and i think all of them have at some point been worked on/ had their thermistor possibly replaced.  the thermistors i have on hand are generic 100k thermistors.  
has anyone ever actually looked at their hotend temp or seen anything like this?","piercet,
i am fairly positive that all my heads are running 100k thermistors.  even the hex heads i have are coming in low.  i havent checked the thermocouple yet, but it did read reasonable values for warm and cool water and ambient.  i dont believe i am getting hot enough on the hot end because when i have the titan hooked up it will extrude a small amount fine (~3mm) once or twice but not multiple times in a row.  this changes depending on how much i try to extrude, leading me to believe that the hot end isn't hot enough and that the filament is getting hot enough if left in the heater block for a little while if left standing.  basically, i dont think i am getting the right amount of power to continuously melt enough filament.  i did set the esteps correctly on the titan, and while it may be off slightly it is certainly close enough to get off the ground."
taz 6 stopped print when i booted into windows,"hi guys,

yesterday i began a print on my sd card and turned off my pc. the print was going fine but then i needed to turn my pc back on to check something unrelated about 20 mins into the print and as my pc booted into windows, the printer just stopped moving but the lcd display said it was still printing. 

i believe this was because of something windows 10 did in the boot process related to loading drivers or it could have been because i have fast boot enabled which uses hibernation to boot faster. is this normal? if so i assume i am going to have to unplug the printer's usb cord when printing off the sd card so that this doesn't happen?

thx","piercet wrote:when you boot a windows computer with a usb attached arduino device, at the driver check portion of the boot process it will reconnect with the printer, usually causing a reboot. it has to do with the way the arduino and the sd card interface is presented to windows. unplugging the usb cable would indeed prevent that issue.

ok cool that makes sense. thanks. "

also, i tried printing using simplfiy3d and it prints the ooze shield perfectly, but i can't seem to adjust the offsets for the heads so it ends up printing with the two colors way off center. i can post pictures later, but i thought for now i would at least come on and see if anyone has any ideas for me.

i found out what was happening about using s3d and the t1 offset. you have to put the gcode command for the offset under the ""scripts"" tab ""start"" script. i tried all the setup locations in s3d for the t1 head and nothing worked till i added it to the script ""start"". 

something like this for start script:
g28 ; all home 
m218 t0 x0 y0  ; sets back nozzle to ""no offset"". may not even need this line.
m218 t1 x-.20 y-51.7 ; sets front nozzle offset in mm from back nozzle.

after i added this  and went back an forth tweaking the numbers i had perfect alignment.

have fun!

i'll give this a try too. i tried to change the offset on the firmware but i have no idea how to do that. i've seen guides online, but it's all greek to me. thanks for all the help guys!"
prime and wipe tower always failing (ngen + pva),"is the combination of materials (ngen + pva) just not work with the priming tower? every print i've tried with this seems to cause the tower to fail and then strands of the filament get dragged along the print. 

is there a recommended course of action for this? maybe run the print bed or nozzles hotter?","hello jason,

it may be a couple of things that contribute to the tower failing. 
one is that the z offset(and the manual adjustment of the t1 nozzle) is having the nozzle just a little too far from the pei, which will not allow the filament to adhere well enough to the pei. the other can be that the ambient temperature is too cool, which can cause adherence issues also.
if you need, you can always take a photo of the first layers and send them to support@lulzbot.com and the support team can see if they can help.
dialing in the nozzle on the t1 extruder is always something that takes a bit of experimenting."
have these issues been fixed? (taz6),"hi all,

i am wanting to buy a taz and have been doing research. i came along this early review with some issues that needed to be fixed with the taz 6. i would like to know if these have all been resolved or which things have not been resolved from this review from anyone who can help. 

https://youtu.be/lojprd2kvnu?t=9m5s

also, not shown in this video, i have read reviews about people having issues with a faulty heatsink on the rambo board that causes the whole board to have to be replaced that lulzbot is aware of atleast as of a few months ago. has this problem been corrected??","cottonfx wrote:

it may be helpful to know which company you were referring to for the filaments. don't be shy you are doing a service to us all. i don't want to have the same issue. also, how is your auto bed level failing each time.. why is it failing or what is it doing? as far as i can tell mine is working so far.

so i'm not 100% on the oem of the filament, it's pla labelled as filaform.  overall it melted ok, stuck well and most prints were usable.  however, i had 3 issues, one as i said was dimensional accuracy.  this was causing some gaps in some (thinner) taller prints and other issues.  initially i thought it was initial layer issues, but the layer at which this would occur was 1, random, 2 a lot higher than when this kind of thing has occurred to me before.  finally i was getting over extrusion randomly throughout the print as well where for example printing the legs of the lowpoly storm-trooper (the one in the vid above) as the print head would move between the shins it would act like a super heavy string, but then no issue as it went further up, then a little under extrusion around the arms.  anyhow over detailed review of that filament, more than +/-.13mm difference min to max, within 1.5m of filament. oh and the third issue was couldn't use the last 4-5m, as it's thicker and it would just break on me as there was a lot of spring tension on it, ie it wanted to be as tightly sprung against the inside of the spool that that tension broke it just as it was getting to the head.  i thought maybe i left it out too long (2 weeks) but i opened a new one and it did the same thing the same day i opened it only this time it was near the start of the spool.  just super fragile and crappy accuracy and it did have silicate pouches.  possibly just a batch issue, but 2 colours had the same issue so minimum 2 batches at issue.

as for the print levelling, it's to do with the method, the machined washers are great, however keep in mind it's the tip of the print head that needs to make electrical contact so longer prints always leave some gunk there that the supplied felt scrubber can't remove completely.  just wait until you try petg, that stuff is so tough and sticky you have to scotch-brite between prints every time to make it work again, but the prints are fantastic, so tough and look great.  i'm going to persist, there's a number of good posts in this section talking about adjustments others have made to make it more reliable overall but i'm finding it's taking me more effort than it's supposed to save (sometimes 3-4 attempts).  i think the best solution to levelling i've seen is hall effect probes seem far more reliable and doesn't require a specific wipe phase at all.  i hope aleph look at another solution for the next generation, this one seems flawed in principal.
oh one more item on levelling, sometimes by adding down pressure you get the electrical contact between the print head and machined washer but it bends the build plate just slightly kicking out the measurement accuracy, so you still end up with first layer issues still as well, only happened twice in 25+ prints but that's yet another thing to watch for."

over time the display has been getting very light to where you had to look at it at an extreme angle to see it. it almost looked like the image was inverted.  is this a temp problem? does it need replacing? can i just replace the screen?






i know the pic looks a little fuzzy but it wouldn't make a difference. that is how it looks.","that's most likely a screen that needs replacing. the good news is you can just swap it out for a new one and fix the issue, no firmware tweaks required as long as it's the same unit. do a search for the fullgraphics lcd. itworks3d.com or lulzbot themselves probably both have them in the us. cheaper alternatives will be non continentally located."
taz 6 extruded harness pinout?,"can anyone point me to the pinout of the taz 6 extruded harness? i'm looking for a 12v source which is always active during a print.

reason: i would like to add a 12v ring led to the extruded assembly to make it easier to see print progress (and potentially for time lapse in the future). on other printers, i've just used the heatbreak cooling fan but on the taz 6, the fans appear to be either 24v or 5v.",the main power supply is a 24 volt supply while many other printers use a 12 volt supply. the 5 volts is used on the rambo for some logic functions and so was tapped for the 5 volt cooling fan. if you want a 12 volt supply then you will need to add a second supply source that gives you the 12 volts you want. you might look into a ~24 volt to 12 volt converter.
diagnostic output,"i work with large industrial cnc machines and most of these machines (modern ones) output their current status (and some, historical) regarding cutting head location, tool part, program running, speed of the head, etc.  

does the taz 6 output similar information, or is it possible to do so?  i'm looking for constant output of print head location, print head temperature, what program/model is running, stuff like that.  we help our customers analyze and detect issues with cuts/prints, and want to use a taz 6 as an in-office demo system of what we do on large scale systems, pushing the data from the printer to our system and then presenting a web based diagnostics panel showing the status of all your printers... one such protocol that is out there is mtconnect, if you're looking for an example of what i mean.

if you can please provide me with any information regarding this, it would be greatly appreciated.

general electric","the quick answer to your question is ""sort of"". most 3d printers in general use stepper motors that do not have any format of positional feedback out of the box. it is possible to add a linear magnetic encoder, and i am working on a project to add that to my taz open builds mod design, but it isn't finished yet. a 3d printer with an lcd does show hotend temperature and theoretical fan speeds. there is real-time feedback of temperature from the hotend and heated bed via the thermistor. there are other sensors you can add, such as fillament width and feed rate sensors. 

with a computer attached, the printer control software shows apparent g code position of the nozzle, g code path, model, temperature histograms, etc. it's not as all encompassing as you would see on a high end cnc, but there is data there."
taz 6 bed leveling chaotic,"good afternoon

i've set up a taz6 printer and almost never get the self-leveling on all four corners properly. the first corner always do well, but the other three fail arbitrarily. sometimes it makes the quick touch but it does not make the slow one, or it does not make the fast one but it tries to do the slow one from a lot of height and it goes to the next corner without getting to touch. from time to time the printer makes the complete sequence and prints correctly. what can happen?

here an example: https://youtu.be/3w6ahghrm6o

thanks and best regards.","your x axis is too far out of level. check the distance from the z leadscrew nut down to the top of the lower leadscrew bearing. i'll think you will find it is different on both sides and it needs to be identical. power the machine off, unplug the motor and manually turn the one that is higher until the height is the same, plug it back in, then try again. 

also those washers on the bed look odd. are you certain they are electrically conductive?"
how much offset is normal for auto alignment?,"as i am still new to the taz 6, i'm not sure i will make sense asking but i'll try.

what i am wondering is, the motors on the left and right of my taz 6 that control the extruder's z axis (up and down if i got that right) are slightly different heights because of the auto alignment. 

what is considered a normal amount of offset between those motors before its getting into the ""this print bed is seriously too unlevel"" area?

another thing i noticed is when the auto alignment happens, on some of the contact points the nozzle touches pretty close to the edge of the washer instead of further in. is this normal or can it be changed so it isnt so close to the edge? 

thanks.","hello cotton,

the x gantry which is what the tool head slides across, should be within 1mm on the left side of the printer, to the right side of the printer. you can measure from the top smooth guide rail(that the tool head slides across) to the top of the frame on the left and then measure from the top smooth guide rail to the top of the frame on the right. if those measurements are different, then turn the silver coupler that attaches the right z axis motor to the right lead screw, to make the measurements the same. this will level the x gantry and allow the z axis to operate more smoothly. 

if you need to adjust where the nozzle touches on the metal pads, you can loosen the 4 thumb screws on the y chassis mounts to move the entire heat bed forward or back in the y axis. if you need to move the heat bed in the x axis to make this better, then you will have to loosen the allen screws that hold the ychassis mounts (holds the y rails to the frame) and then slide the entire y assembly to the left or the right  to try to center where the nozzle touches and then tighten them back down. the nozzle may never touch exactly in the middle on all 4 pads, but you can make it better.

i hope this helps."
"got my new taz 6, have some questions.","hi,

so i finally got my taz 6 yesterday and so far have printed the rocktupus and 2 cell phone cases out of n-gen. everything is working pretty well... but i had a few initial questions that i thought some of the veterans could help me with. 

1. is the plastic piece that the filament feeds into at the start of the filament guide tube supposed to stay stationary and vertical? it has a ring on it that the book said to slide over the mount for it, but that causes it to swing backwards and forwards freely. not sure how it supposed to happen.

2. is there noticable difference in performance from printing something from the pc or directly from the sd card? like if i set it up in cura and save the gcode to the card, then print from the printer... does all that info from cura come over in the gcode and does it print exactly the same as from the pc? (only without having to have both sucking power the whole time.)

3. i am finding that i cannot access or read the sd card using my pc, when the sd card is inserted in the taz 6 and the taz 6 is connected to my pc. i am able to control the printer with cura and everything, its just i expected to be able to save things on the sd card while it is inserted into the printer without having to take it out and move it to my other card slot (which works so there is nothing wrong with the sd card.) 

4. everything i have printed using colorfabb n-gen, i have just printed on a 85c print bed and it stuck good. in cura, it says n-gen is supposed to use a glue stick, but the first print thing didn't call for that either so i am confused on when i would need a glue stick. the rocktopus stuck a little too well. when i tried to get it off, it seemed to make some rough spots on the print bed as it popped off that could not be cleaned off. i sanded the area with some 2000 grit paper until i can't feel it much now then used alcohol to clean it. hopefully thats not a bad move but the book said something about sanding it occasionally.


anyway, thats enough for now  really enjoying it so far and can't wait to get deeper into making.","piercet wrote:1. yes, it is supposed to do that. it allows the fillament to pivot within the guide tube to allow for a smoother allignment path to the print head. it also allows for using a floor mounted fillament spool rather than one on the frame if desired. 

2. no difference in performance under most circumstances. printing from the pc, depending on the program you are using you can sometimes get away with printing a larger gcode file than you might directly from the sd card if your software supports incremental transmit, but you also run risks of failed prints due to reboots, etc. i personally run my main printer via usb, many people prefer sd card simply due to the reboot issue. 

3. i don't use the sd card much, so someone else will have to answer that one. 

4. the gluestick prevents excessive adhesion. many people don't use it, some find that it helps. fixing a rough spot via sanding is fine

great info thanks! now if anyone knows the answer to #3 i'll be all set "
heater resistor stuck in heater block,"i came back to find my printer merrily going through all the motions of printing, but not actually extruding. i had this happen before and the problem was that the heater resistor had burnt out. fortunately i now keep a spare heater resistor around.

unfortunately i'm finding that the resistor won't budge from the heater block. i've tried half heartily tapping it out to no avail (didn't want to damage anything). tomorrow i'm planning on trying to use a dremel to remove enough of the resistor for the pieces to come out.

is this a common issue? and if so, is there a trick to freeing the burnt out resistor from the heater block?

thanks in advance!","ended up using a deep wall socket to support the heater block and a punch to pound the resistor out. drilling the resistor did not work as the resistor is ceramic and extremely hard. just had to get fairly aggressive with the punch and hammer. printer is up and running again, so apparently it survived the experience no worse for wear."
upgrade 4 to 6?,"i have a 4 and am having horrible problems with the z axis binding. i see that the taz 6 has a radically different setup for the z ends and x carriage. if i print new z tops and bottoms and x ends can i use the rest of my current parts (screws, rods, nozzle, etc) to upgrade my printer?","yes, though you would need the larger 12mm rods and bearings for the x axis. you can get most if not all of what you need right here: https://itworks3d.com/product-category/ ... z-6-parts/ 

you will also need to upgrade to a hexagon hotend and implement the auto leveling setup, because the 6 parts do not have a manual z height adjustment target. a 6 style bed is $20, a hexagon kit is around $70ish. the corner bits for auto leveling and the harness are probably going to be another $30-$40 or so. 

you may also want to look at the openbuilds x, y and z axis projects:
http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:866604
http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:949082
http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1038673

all that being said, you really need to track down and understand what the z binding issue you are running into is before you attempt an upgrade that may compound that issue. to eliminate that, try the following first
1. with a  set of verneir calipers, make sure the distance from the bottom of the x axis end leadscrew nut to the top of the lower leadscrew bearing is the exact same on both sides. 
2. look at the top leadscrew bearing. is the top of the leadscrew up the center shaft all the way, and the same height both sides?
3. check the bottom z motor mounts. are they both down on the leadscrews all the way so there is no leadscrew play? 
4. watch the z motor couplings for a couple of layers. do either of them look like they are compressing on one side? are there any breaks
5. does each leadscrew coupling have all 4 setscrews, are they down and tight and on the motor and leadscrew shaft flat spaces for at least one setscrew per side? these can easily fall out and cause binding. 
6. if none of that was it, check the frame front and back with a 90 degree square
7. if it still has issues, unbolt the x axis bearing rod setscrews on the idler side, then run the axis up and down the z axis agin. move it back to the middle of the axis, then retighten the screws. this will eliminate either pinching or over bowing. 
8 if it still is binding, try loosening the bolts holding the z motor in place on the side it is binding and see if that has any effect.

you also want to put white lithium grease on your z axis leadscrews if there isn't any already."
"difference between ""north america"", ""european union"" and ""australia""?","hi!
does anyone know if there's any difference between the three versions of the taz ""north america"", ""european union"" and ""australia"", other than the power plug?

the product brochure says about the specs of the psu itself: 
power requirements: 100-240 vac

so i understand that it's a modern switching power supply, which can handle a wide range of input voltages. so is there any other difference except the psu cable, which has the plug corresponding to the relevant country?
thanks for the info!!","all three variants use the same meanwell power supply http://www.mouser.com/ds/2/260/rsp-500-spec-806407.pdf specifically the rp500-24 24 volt variant. the different versions are likely only due to the plug, and possibly any different regulatory notices or shipping compliance rules (for example, european union has different rules regarding packaging materials than the us does)"
stepper motor unresponsive in e01 port; unsure as to how to switch,"hey there! running a taz 4/kittaz with stock standard equipment. except for a few cosmetic modifications. my extruder motor stopped responding a little while ago. assuming it dead, i replaced it. still nothing. when swapped from the e01 port to the z axis port on the rambo board, it works fine, leading me to believe it's an issue with he connection port on the board or the firmware. 

i noticed i have a spare board port for an extruder, e0, but i'm not sure how i'd go about swapping the extruder to it. plugging it into said port gets no response. otherwise, the machine responds as expected.

anyone have some insight as to how to fix this issue? i haven't got the scratch to replace the rambo board at the moment.","did you build this machine, or did you buy it assembled from someone? the reason i ask is that the stepper with the default firmware should have been attached to e0 already. the only reason to move a single extruder over to e1 is if the e0 motor control stepper driver chip has failed. otherwise it's a bit of work for no good reason. having even one of them fail by now would be pretty rare, but not unheard of. having both fail would point to either inadequate cooling (machine in an enclosure without the control box vented, failed fan, wrong fan firmware, etc.) or possibly inadequate grounding of the rambo board. if it was moved and adjusted in firmware, it may be due to the other extruder port having already failed. 

to switch to using e1 if it isn't already enabled in firmware does require some firmware surgery. cura can probably do it automatically. if not, it's going to be in the configuration.h file for the printer, or you can just flash back to the stock taz 4 firmware (or the taz 5 firmware if the machine has been upgraded to a hexagon nozzle)  here are the kittaz instructions on where everything should have ended up. https://ohai.lulzbot.com/project/ad3648 ... 5e059ccf7/ 

it would require more effort to switch the harness over to e1 than it would to just set it up using e0 if nothing was wrong. 

if it turns out it is melty, you can source an inexpensive used board from https://itworks3d.com/product-category/ ... ectronics/ 

if you want a brand new one, ordering directly from ultimachine https://ultimachine.com/products/rambo-1-3 is the least expensive option. you can also source them directly from lulzbot. 

if the extruder motor is the only part not working, it's not likely to be the fuses unfortunately."
time lapse print recording,"what are you guys doing for time-lapse videos of your prints? i am curious about doing this but have no idea how to do it.

thanks,
chris","a turnkey solution is matterhacker's touch https://www.matterhackers.com/store/pri ... -touch-t10, but i use octoprint, which is lower cost.

all you need for octoprint is a raspberry pi, a case (which you can 3d print) and power supply (5 volt 2.5 amp maximum depending on what raspberry pi) for it, and pretty much any usb camera, probably $100 maximum for all. i highly suggest a raspberry pi 3, as it has wifi built in to it. 

to make it easier, use the octopi, which is a preconfigured software build that you just load onto a micro sd card, modify a file on it to change your password and ssid for your network, and start it up. it's literally that easy. there are a number of step by step tutorials on youtube to walk even the clueless through it. one gotcha is that you need to make sure you format large cards as fat32, which you can use the free utility fat32 utility found here http://www.ridgecrop.demon.co.uk/index. ... format.htm.

taz 6 dual upgrade options,"is the servo, hotend, ect the same parts on this as the single head that comes with the taz 6 https://www.lulzbot.com/store/tool-head ... ol-head-v2

there are also experimental options:

you can also fit something like an e3d titan extruder to a taz that will theoretically output flexible fillament, though fitting it to a dual carriage might be a challenge.

can anyone advise me on how to solve this? i'm guessing it has to do with the retraction or the nozzle switching settings but i have not had to time to mess with it yet.

thanks in advance","xyzaidan wrote:i think you may have misinterpreted my information. the ninjaflex and pla print behind the pile of ninjaflex comes out almost perfectly, it's just that the ninjaflex nozzle oozes a lot when not in use. i'm using the ninjaflex profile provided by the lulzbot-edition of cura. the temperature is at 225, which is well within the materials printing temperature. there is no filament grinding, and i am in fact using real ninjaflex. i've already spent the past month printing calibration prints and following lulzbot's tutorials for calibration. to reiterate, the print itself comes out nearly perfectly, so i don't think my printer ""isn't even close to being correctly dialed in"".

taz head v2.1 clogging,"hy

i changed to the new toolhead because i thought i can eliminate the clogging completely with the help of the bigger cooling fan.
however i still get domrhow clogging from time to time at various heights in my prints....

i print my pla with 195°c and 50°c on my bed.
retraction is on, 1mm with 15mm/s speed

and still i get this kind of clogging:






what else can i do to prevent this from happening...

andy","hello gecko,
as piercet said, initial layer height, z offset will have a lot to do with stripping. one of the issues with pla is that as you increase resistance due to the nozzle being too close to the heat bed and the filament trying to extrude through a road block, it allows the filament to slow down in the extrusion and remain in the hot end longer than it should. this affects the pla by transferring heat up the filament. then the filament becomes more malleable (ever so slightly) and then increases the resistance to feed through the feed tube. ultimately resulting in stripping.
once this has happened then often you will heave residual filament in the hot end that has remained there too long and will crystallize. this then will add further resistance to the feeding of the filament.
please raise the tool head off of the heat bed and manually extrude 50 to 100 mm of filament. if when it first comes out of the tool head, it tries to curl up, then it will indicate that you have clogging in the hot end and you will need to do several cold pulls to clear the hot end before it will operate correctly. if you do have the curling, then please look at this link for cold pull information:
https://www.lulzbot.com/support/unclogging-tips

once you have done this, then set your springs on the tensioner to 5mm, in between the washers and set your z offset up properly. a good starting point for the taz6 is about -1.39.
then start your print and see if you have better operation of the tool head. 
hope this may help."
worth repairing?,"i've just had a taz 4 delivered. i purchased it second hand. 
due to the packaging the printer has arrived smashed. 
all the corner brackets have snapped so the frame is in two pieces. 
is there any other damage i should be looking for? 
are the parts available to repair this? i couldn't see them in the store. 
i need to decide whether to try and repair it or send it back to the seller.","the parts are available, https://itworks3d.com/product/taz-6-cor ... cket-v2-0/ 

you will need 7 ot do a full set if you want to swap out to the taz 6 metal style ones, or they have new carbon fiber ones. the metal ones are $7 each, and they are stiffer than the acrylic ones which helps with frame stability. 

they also have the extrusions there if any of those are damaged. allignment is going to be the other big issue. you can see the allignment and build process here:  https://ohai.lulzbot.com/group/a16b1f2d ... 8cca5d62c/ (the taz 5 build process pictures show more of the frame allignment steps. they also have the 4 pictures there) 

if you got a good enough deal, and the seller is willing to pay for the replacement parts, and the leadscrews and bearing rods appear intact, it may be worth keeping and rebuilding."
taz 5 pei sheet replacement?,"ok, i have come to the breaking point, well the pei has at least.

it has bubbled to the point that its virtually unusable in major portions of the bed.  it started several months after i got the taz and has slowly progressed.  and this week, one of the bubbles tore when removing a part from the bed rendering the front half unusable because i am afraid the nozzle will catch on the torn edges if it traverses over it on the first few layers.  if that happens, it will destroy more than the pei.  its got to be replaced.

yall have both the pei for $45 and a whole print bed (heater/glass/pei) for $150.  so, how much fun (read pita) is it going to be to get the existing sheet off, clean glass and a new one on?  is it worth $100 just to get a whole new kit and be done with it?  or is it fairly easy to remove the old one and attach a new one?  if i replace the whole schebang, i can keep the old one and remove the sheet/glue as time permits and have a pure glass bed if i need one.  or a heater for doing acetone smoothing.  so its not a total waste.

is there any instructions anywhere on replacing it?  like how to remove the old one and the adhesive, etc so i get a nice clean glass to apply a new sheet to?

anyone replaced their pei on a taz (or other printer)?  what was your experience?  i don't want to have the printer down for very long but a weekend project to swap the pei is acceptable.  if it turns into weeks, then its worth the extra $100 to get the kit.","i've replaced 3 pei sheets on my mini, it's not really that bad.

1. take off glass bed and put it in the freezer for 1 hour.
2. remove bed from freezer (optional: remove pizza rolls from freezer and make those as well to eat while working on this)
3. pull off pei sheet. the cold allows the pei sheet to come off very easily.
4. using a sharp razor blade and ipa, scraps the adhesive off the glass plate until clean.
5. place the edge of the new pei sheet against one edge of the glass and slowly remove the paper backing exposing the adhesive as you use a straight edge to push out bubbles as you go.

granted the taz is a bigger build plate, but for me on the mini, the entire job after removing it from the freezer takes about 30-45 min.

it honestly wasn't that bad. my uncle did his last week for the first time and it took him about an hour after the freezer. i'd say diy!

taz 6 retracting too much before leveling?,"working with a brand new taz 6 and some ngen blue pla.  

so far most of the prints are turning out great.  but there have been some issues in starting prints recently.  

it seems like the printer is retracting too far before cleaning the nozzle.  even with a large skirt around my part, the extruder is often still just pushing air when it should be printing the part.  

this means cancelling and cleaning/auto-leveling all over again. 

is there some way i can prevent this from happening?","you can use some purge gcode in your startup gcode to make sure the nozzle is primed before printing.

i have taz 5 machines so, you might need to adjust the x / y positions for a taz 6.

this is the code i use just after homing the printer before the print starts:
g91                            ; relative positioning
g1 z+10 e+10 x+20 f3000   ; move z up a bit and purge filament move right

temperature controlled enclosure,"hey everyone, 

i had a wonderful idea the other day, i'm just not knowledgeable enough to pull it off.  with winter coming i'm finding myself needing a heated enclosure for my taz to help out those 48hr abs prints from cracking.  

it occurred to me the other day that there is an extra temperature probe connection on the rambo board because i'm not using a dual extruder. therefore, if i were to use the second temp probe to measure the ambient air temperature then the gcode can be used to set the temperature of my enclosure.  

where i am getting confused is where a output signal could be located on the rambo board to close the relay and bring on the heat when needed.  any thoughts?","i've been considering building an enclosure too and find myself wondering just what exactly is needed/useful? looking around i see everything from cardboard boxes (way to ugly lol) to some really sophisticated endeavors (the hot box comes to mind... i'd let the designer build me a house).  
i'm still relatively new to 3d, but have experienced enough warpage/layer separation with a few large abs prints to consider the enclosure route. on the other hand, i see some very skilled printers here who do not appear to use one and seem to manage well sans enclosure? that leads me to think that it may be easy to indulge in overkill with enclosures. just how much temp control is warranted? i've heard the number 40c (104f) bandied about as ideal ambient for abs. i'm not sure if there are other exotics that would benefit from higher ambient temps?  i've also seen lots of peeps using acrylic enclosures with no additional heat source (other than a heated bed) and maintaining temps about 90f, ~32c and giving rave revues about results. i wonder also how much benefit is gained just creating the dead air space/removing drafts?

 i wonder where the sweet spot really is and how far one really must go to get there?"
two printers one computer,"looking to hook up a second taz 6 so when large prints are running we can run smaller parts on a second machine.  what needs to be considered when hooking up two printers to one computer? is it as simple as opening cura in two windows and operating them separately or are there other things to consider?

thanks for the help.","i would avoid printing using the usb interface at all.  save the .gcd file on the included sd card and print from that.  in the end it's way less hassle and avoids several failure modes.  i have never had a print fail while using an sd card as the source.  i have had a few fail when using a laptop, mostly due to communication glitches, windows updating, or any other random cause that i was never able to figure out.  

the only thing i use the usb interface for now is updating firmware.

using this method, you could conceivably print on a unlimited number of printers from just one computer.  i'm also pretty sure this is how lulzbot prints all the parts for their production parts."
taz 6 thermal runaway,"so i have been printing with my taz 6 for a couple of weeks now and have been pretty happy with it.

a quick forum search suggests that the issue is that the fan duct design is cooling the extruder too well.

should i be concerned about this? would i be fine with trying to print the same file again?","okay, this is an interesting topic.  i'm in the process of upgrading my taz 5 cooling fans to the taz 6 design. i printed out the parts last night, but still need to print the extruder fan mount. i've seen a couple of designs, the one from the ao site is pretty much just a fan mount w/o a duct.  it seems the designs that include ducting may be over cooling the hot end too much?  

do you find disadvantages to simply using the fan mount w/o duct? it seems to me that sans ducting could cause print cooling too since the hot end fan stays on, that'd be okay with pla i guess, but would it negatively affect filaments like abs? 

i really respect your design expertise piercet, what design do you use?"
practical minimum layer height with taz-6 with ngen filament,"besides the large print volume, one of the specs on the info sheet that sold me on the printer was the minimum layer height of 0.05-mm. 

after receiving the printer and using the ngen filament, i've started running through the stock profiles. diving into the profiles the layer_height variable seems to translate pretty closely to an actual mm thickness. i'm using a cheap digital caliper, so it's likely closer than my measurements.

using this filament, practically how low can i push it? after i finish printing one of each profile as a reference i'm going to start tinkering with the extrusion settings. the layer_height of the ""high quality"" profile is 0.18-mm and i would like to push this to at a maximum of 0.09-mm. 

does anyone here have experience minimizing the layer height? some of the parts on the machine itself seem to have a much smaller layer height than what's currently printing on the machine. are those profiles known?

any help would be appreciated.","the biggest key to layer height is getting your fillament and extruder dialed in perfectly. you need to be extruding perfect calibration cubes at 100% infil and other calibration objects that measure exact to the fraction of a mm before you try going for the extreme thin layers. good, consistant width fillament is a must. on a modified taz 5, 0.01 is possible with abs for sure. a taz 6 should be able to get into that same range. another thing to watch out for is any evidence of z wobble. the thinner the layer, the more likely z wobble will be apperent at the edge of the part. 

super thin layers also sometimes result in super annoying adhesion to the bed, to the point the object can be extremely difficult to remove without destroying the bed.  

at super small scales, any imperfections immidiatly magnfy. nozzle goobers, loose carriages, etc. all are catestrophic at that resolution. it takes patience, and a great deal of time to get good parts at that scale. if you are going for super fine layers, you may also want to consider going with a smaller nozzle, lime a 0.1mm or 0.2mm. that will add considerable time to your prints, but will make it easier to control the smaller layers."
taz 5 to taz 6 v2.1 upgrade,"question #1:

jamie at itworks3d.com tells me i can upgrade my taz 5 single extruder to v2.1 using these componenets:
                - (bug upgrade) 5v heatsink cooling fan https://itworks3d.com/product/fan-5v-40mm-pelonis/
                - here's the extra 24v filament cooling fan, you want the 2 wire version https://itworks3d.com/product/fan-24v-40mm/
                - heat inserts you'll need for the printed parts https://itworks3d.com/product/metric-br ... -plastics/

is there an official ohai or lulzbot guide to this upgrade that will show me all of the printed components i will need, the sizes of the brass inserts, wiring, programming?

question #2:

i see this guide on thingiverse: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1149597  which appears to be a taz 5 extruder upgrade, but is this more than what i want or need vs. the v2.1?

i am a mechanic by trade, so i am familiar with wiring and mechanical aspects of these upgrades, but relatively new to 3d printing (7 months), so the programming part/gcode is where i would need help.

thanks in advance,

chester","there isn't an official guide for upgrading the extruder to the new version of the extruder toolhead, but the general steps are going to be as follows:

1. split the fillament cooling fan power lead and attach it to two 24v 40mm fans to cool from both sides. 
2. replace the 5v squirrel cage fan witha  5v 40mm fan
3. print the stock carriage and the upgraded fixed idler that relieves the stress as found in the tech bulliten in the forums. you should be able to reuse the stock body. or alternativly print the modified one you linked. or my variant of that one. 
4. add heat set inserts (m3) to the fan mount hole hardpoints. there should be two per side fan, and one for the middle fan. 
5. print the fan shrouds from the stock taz 6 download.lulzbot.com folder or the ones from the modified set."
filament material used for production printed parts?,"i am thinking of re-making a few of the printed parts for my taz 5.
i can download .stl or gcode files but nothing tells me what material the production parts are printed from.
e.g. gcode files do not have it commented and do not have set temperatures in the code so i cant tell from this.
.stl file of course are totally independent of material.
can somebody make this clear please? ","taz 3d printer parts are in general printed out of villiage plastics abs, printed at 85% infil on 0.5mm nozzles at 0.35-ish layer height. temperature range i would start at is 100c for the bed, 240c for the nozzle. the green parts might be ngen, i'm not sure. the flexible parts are ninjaflex and require a flexystruder to produce."
getting axis shift on taz 5 all of the sudden,"hey everyone, this has just started happening this morning. the blank spaces in the middle are supposed to be filled in by the double-triangle looking shapes (like the on the second to the left on the top left), but 90% of them are offset by being too much to the left or right. has this happened to anyone else? i have no idea what has caused it as i've never had a single problem with this printer ever before. 

http://imgur.com/a/nbftj","piercet wrote:there are three things that can cause axis shift.
1. a belt is loose in the direction of the shift, tighten the belt and inspect the belt path for damage
2. a belt pully is loose in the direction of the shift. even if the belt is tight, this symptom can still present if the setscrews in the pulley itself are loose or missing. 
3. electronic overheating of the motor driver. usually caused by having a printer in an enclosure with inadequate electronics venting, the main enclosure fan failing, or one of the on board heat sinks falling off.

the first two i checked and nothing's wrong with them. i checked the main fain that's attached to the enclosure and that's also fine. i checked for any fallen heatsinks, but everything's attached. anything else that could be causing it?"
failure at height issue?,"hello, i have a taz4 with new extruder head (so basically a taz5).
i have not changed filaments, or anything else.  but all my prints are failing after around 3 inches of height, they magically come unstuck from the plate and wind up a mess.    i have the taz 4 glass plate, i have tried abs slush, white glue, hair spray etc.  the plate is tacky to the touch now....  i have expanded the brim, adjusted the temp of the plate from 50 to 70 degrees, adjust the filament temp up and down as well.
what else can i try?  is there perhaps a mechanical problem i should look at?
it used to work,  on the same spool i printed successfully, now the identical files are all peeling off.  so something is wrong somewhere.
my printer is used to make products, some of these have print times in *days* so i have yet to catch it actually failing... it seems to wait until i leave the room or look away for a few minutes.","it doesn't look like anything other than a halted print that got knocked off the table, and then the natural spaghetti you get from extruding with nothing under it.  i can post pictures though once i get home.

there is no enclosure.   room temp is around 60 f

if i set it up to print again right after it happens everything starts fine, so that would mean there is no clog or chewing.

1 kilo roll (matterhackers pla white).   no damage to the feed tube.  it flows normally until it gets to some height.

idler arm should also be fine, i can print normally on shorter print jobs (both in time and height).

i am puzzled... and annoyed."
taz 5 w/ dual extruder not reaching temperature,"i have a taz5 on which i've installed a dual extruder. i'm only using the rear extruder at the moment. it seems like the extruder is slowly degrading in terms of the temperatures it can reach. last week, attempting to print polycarbonate at 290c, it wouldn't go over 278c. today, it's maxing at 259. this problems seems to be exaggerated when printing from a card. the computer seems to bring it up to temp quicker and closer to the desired setting. printing off the card, it takes forever to even get to 239c.

does this seem like hardware? could the way the software (simplify3d) or hardware monitors the temperature be responsible?

i'm going to give the front extruder a try and see if the issue repeats with that tool.","printing from the front extruder now and it's a totally different world. apparently, i've been fighting what seems to be a bad extruder for months without realizing it. i've been tweaking settings galore to make very marginal prints. i'd even started questioning the quality and shelf life of some of my materials and purchased an expensive drier. i'll be making a call to lulzbot monday."
"brand new taz 4 won't feed filament, only strips it","right out of the box it won't feed correctly. there is a setting of the idler tension screws where it will feed well for a few seconds, and then stops as the hobbed bolt chews into the filament. nothing from totally loose, to springs fully collapsed, works. so have not even made it thru setup.

the setup instructions tell you to ""...tighten till top of screw is 10mm from plastic clip..."".then later ""...tighten again until spring is 5mm +/- 2mm"" . on my system, the spring is already fully collapsed at the 10mm, and can't be tightened further.

that in mind. i tried removing the pair of flat washers on each screw to pick up another mm or so. didn't make a difference.

the nozzle is in midair, so not a nozzle spacing issue
the filament is fresh lulz 3mm abs right out of sealed bag, so not humidity or size issue
shavings are cleaned out after each attempt (probably about 20 by now).
nozzle is at temp (230c)

i contacted tech support 3 days ago with zero response (yes, checked my quarantine).

appreciate any advice or suggestions.","there are 4 things that can cause filliament stripping:
1.  a blocked nozzle. filliament is produced by melting plastic beads and extruding them under force from a larger nozzle. it is very unusual to run into filliament that contains any sort of obstruction, but it does happen, usually with cheaper filliament where someone tried to use filler powder. if you are running decent filliament this should never be an issue. 

2. filliament spool or feed drag. if the filliament can't move freely into the cold end of the extruder, it can jam

3. extruder tension too high or too low. for abs you want it fairly tight. a good indicator is feeding a section into the hot end, and then pulling it back out. if you see a nice even and consistant tooth pattern on the hobbed bolt side of the filliament you are pretty much right where it needs to be. if you see uneven pressure, or intermittant shallow areas of partial stripping, you need to tighten the screws a bunch. if it just instantly strips out, you might hav ethem too tight. 

4. last but most common, is nozzle backpressure. molten abs plastic is not a compressible liquid. it doesn't get smaller in volume when it heats. if you are pushing on the melted plastic on one end, but it has no where to go, its the exact same equivelent to trying to extrude directly into a solid brick wall. if you are too close to the bed, you effectivly temporarily plug the nozzle and your filliamenty strips. if your part lifts and your nozzle ends up to close to it, your nozzle is temporarily blocked and your filliament strips out. if your upper right hand corner is too high and your nozzle gets too close to it, the excess plastic build up in the melt chamber causes overpressure and results in a filliament strip. if your filliament setting is smaller inside the slic3r profile than the filliament diameter you are actually feeding, the machine will overextrude slightly, building up gradual excess filliament and eventually cayse a temporary nozzle blockage that will cause your filliament to strip. 

it's all about spring tension and flow. if your springs are tight enough, you have a flow issue somewhere."

taz 6 top surface pattern,"hello,

i was hoping someone could help me troubleshoot an issue with the top surface of my part (pictures attached top(1st picture) and bottom (second picture)). first off i am running a relatively new taz 6 bought in august this year and i did not initially have this problem. this print was done with verbatim pla at 30 mm/s, 210°c, 30% infill, 7 top layers.  i get a surface pattern that appears to be 2 lines then a gap repeated. it also happens when i try other filaments.

i have done my best to calibrate the extrusion, to do this i have calibrated the extruder e steps by measuring the filament and extruding, but this was only a very minor adjustment really as it was already pretty good.  i have also printed test extrusion pieces: 1) a hollow box that is one 'line' thick 0.5 and 2) http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1622868.  both of these tests when i originally started using the machine suggested i needed to lower my flow rate to 0.95 to be accurate.  as before the one 'line' thick would be 0.58 or so and the test piece would be slightly over extruded as well.  so i have been using a flow rate of 0.95 and going to 1 does not seem to change the issue.

googling this i have found that this pattern may be caused by backlash and to check the belt tightness, but the belts seem pretty tight (although i don't know what i am comparing this to) and there does not seem to be any play in the extruder or bed movement. adding additional top layers also does not help. i typically print with simplify3d but the same issue is seen using cura.

does anyone have any ideas as to the cause? should i try and tighten the belts more?

thanks,
sean","scraw089 wrote:i went back to a flow rate of 1.0 and did a small test print and that seemed to fix it. ...

taz 5 idler snapped,"hi all

the idler snapped on my taz 5 (again). i know there's the service bulletin (here: https://www.lulzbot.com/sites/default/f ... lletin.pdf) but i'd already printed a spare so i'll use that for now, and print the upgrade once i'm back up and running.

what i don't know and can't find, is the sequence of bolt/washer/nut. i know the nut fits in the hex socket on the inside face of the idler, as per the top-left picture in the service bulletin, but what happens on the other arm? does the bolt just loosely sit in the hole which is way bigger than it? seems the bolt should fit into another nut or something on that side too but i can't see any mention of the build sequence online and the photos are generally really dark. any advice much appreciated!

also, does anyone recommend a modified idler over the stock one for the taz 5?

thanks
danny","yes, the far end of the bolt ends up in the large hole. there is room for improvement on that particular latch, but it works decently so most people ignore it. i have a variant that uses a heat set insert in place of the nut. there is also the new version available for testing here:

print freezing - large herringbone gear from sd card,"i'm attempting to print the large herringbone gear from the sd card and it keeps freezing at the same spot early in the print.  it prints the outer diameter (extrusion warm up), 3 of 4 of the inner circles and then half way through the 4th one it just stops short and freezes.  the lcd display still says it's printing.  pausing and resuming does nothing.  i've restarted the printer, re-calibrated stuff, but the results are the same.

is this an issue with printing from the sd card, this particular gcode file, or something else?   i'd like to print spares and thought this was the simplest approach.  should i download and print from cura instead?    

fwiw - i printed the small herringbone gears fine from the sd card.","i have a similar intermittent problem with my taz5, usually within the first layer or two. it simply locks up and refuses to budge, saying it's still printing when it's clearly not. if it happened more than a few times in a row, i'd reformat the sd card. if it still gave me grief, i'd restart the printer. 

i think the issue may lie with removing the sd card from the pc after it's written the gcode, like it may not be done when it says so."
taz 6: large prints shifting while dual extrusion printing,"hello,

we've checked the belt tensions and they're all even and right, the guide rods are all straight, we've checked the g code in a visualizer, and we've tried printing at half speed. we've also tried setting the files up for dual extrusion in both tinkercad and 123d design, but get the same results for both.

we're out of ideas on what could be wrong and any help would be greatly appreciated.","kaempfer wrote:ok, i don't know which set screws you mean, so i checked all of them and none seemed loose. we also tried printing from an sd card and it happened again, but in the middle of the first layer. the control box doesn't feel hot, but the x and y motors do.

snapped nozzle - with solution,"so each day in 3d printing brings new challenges and learning and figured i would pass on a solution in case this happens to you. this one was on my taz6 but i imagine it could happen on any fdm printer, and i found a creative solution. so my extruder really clogged with htpla, and refused to unclog with the usual techniques, etc and ultimately i decided to remove the nozzle and unclog it. 

the nozzle snapped off at the threads as it was so encrusted with plastic. support at lulzbot told me i needed a whole new hot end? really? tried a whole bunch of things to get it out, then it hit me, and brought in my bolt extractor kit, and voila (a tad scary to unscrew a ""nut"" at 165c but it nicely backed it out easily and smoothly). now back to printing...

has this ever happened to anyone?

","this is a known issue with the way the hexagon nozzles tighten up against the heater block and become over stressed when the heater block expands. i had a lot of trouble with this on my printers. to fully eliminate the problem, i switched to e3d v6 nozzles. they are longer and tighten internally against the hexagon heat brake rather than the heater block. just something to consider if you continue to experience fractured nozzles.

failed prints,"ok, so i'm having trouble re-printing a part.  i printed this part a few weeks ago, and it was by far the best large print that i've done.  since then, i've tried 5 or 6 times, and it's always failed as it makes the transition from the large horizontal bottom to the vertical sides.  the failure that i see is that the filament stops feeding.  the hobbed bolt then grinds away the filament, and nothing else is extruded until i cut off the filament and re-feed.  

when i correct the problem, i pull the filament out, cut off the last couple of inches, then push it back into the extruder by hand.  i've never seen any blockages in the nozzle, so i'm not sure what's causing the problem.  i've taken a picture of the part, and attached the stl file and gcode.  anybody have any thoughts on what else i can try?","nopick wrote:pla? if so, try pointing a small fan at the printer. if that corrects the problem, you probably have a faulty hot end cooling fan. i have had massive problems with those small stock fans.


yes, push plastic brand pla, in red.

that's about what my guess was as well, so i've been moving to faster print speeds and thicker layer heights to try to combat the problem.  what do you mean by a small fan?  i've got some 40mm fans sitting around, or some 4"" desk fans (i'm guessing that the 20"" floor fans would be too much?)"
use only one extruder of dual extruder v2,"have been using my taz 5 off and on since december. last weekend, i upgraded to the dual extruder v2. i am currently working my way through figuring out all the cura settings, including creating my own profile by modifying the three that are there, and just getting good prints.

i would like to do a standard one filament print, but i would rather not go through uninstalling the dual extruder and reinstalling the single extruder. is there a way through settings to tell it to only use the back (t0) extruder?","kmanley57 wrote:cheesejam wrote:anyone used just one extruder on the taz 6? none of these solutions seem to work for me.

i have a number of times. i basically do what is recommended by the support group on using the start and end code for the single and then make sure i do not heat up the front extruder in the slicing software. if you are trying to use the front and not the back one then you have to use both in the start and end code as the back is the one used for probing and it needs heated to clear any filament on the tip of the nozzle. then after the leveling routine you can probably turn the unused back extruder off to prevent cooking the material in the nozzle.

i am trying to use just the front, flexible, extruder on my taz 6. how do i tell cura that i am just using this extruder? when i load two models in for dual extrusion and merge, the first model loaded in prints from the back extruder. but if i am just printing with the front extruder, how do i do this? how does it know i am not trying to just use the back extruder?"

i've been using my taz6 for about 4 weeks now with pretty good success.

it appears to be called black magic.

i can't find this in cura anyplace.
i'm using cura version 20.01 because that's the version i downloaded per instructions that came along when the taz6 shipped.

any words of wisdom would be appreciated.

thanks
gary","i tried out the black majic settings.
i used the default settings on the 1st 2 parts which worked perfectly and the parts even held water.
on the 3rd part, i changed the retraction from 1mm to 1.3mm.
that appears to have caused a couple of extruder noodles to be slightly under extruded.
the 3rd part does not hold water perfectly.
but that gives me a reason to try filling in the under extruded lines with an abs/acetone slurry to see if i can correct that problem
without reprinting the part.

idler tension,"hey guys, i'm a noobie and have only had a printer for two months. i looked around but didn't see any specific instructions on how tight to set the idler. i don't want to over tighten it but i've also had it to loose and the gear stripped the filament. any tips? i'm assuming it will be different depending on type of material.

thanks in advance.","just thought i'd chime in here with my experience, which is not much but, here goes.
i was nearing the end of a spool of ngen material.
looking at the spool, as the print was running, i thought, i wonder what happens if the filament sticks because of the
way it's wrapped on the spool?
i found the answer pretty quickly!
when the ngen filament somewhat stuck because of the way it happened to unwind from the spool, the hobbed gear
spun on the filament and the print failed.
..
lesson learned.
..
when nearing the end of a spool, either unwind the spool and place the loose stuff on the spool holder, or
really watch and assist the spool to rotate so the filament does not, in any manner get hung up.

taz 6...continued z issuea,"ok so here's the story. from day one the printer has z artifacts. have done the following as suggested by lulzbot. it's the taz 6.

resquared the frame and loosened the z nuts housings. no effect.

performed pid tuning on both bed and extruder. no effect. 

recalibrated esteps. no effect.

checked all belts and retensioned. no effect.

rebuilt entire frame and z motor and lead screw assemblies. no effect.

replaced extruder with e3d v6 and returned pid calibrations. no effect. 

tried both cura and s3d. same results on all settings used. 30 plus test prints.

anyone got ideas?","hello cjay,

if you have tried everything, then get with support and put the stock tool head back on and let them set up an rma to see if you have an issue with a lead screw on the printer. it may be that they will need to be replaced. it is not common, but not unheard of."
how to clean extruder after fail,"i started a big job (about 175 g) and when i came back in this was the mess surrounding the print head. i removed the extruder head and the big gob is not coming off easily. i called support since the printer is under warranty, and they suggested sending the head in.

any suggestions for me to try before sending it back?









","hello profhuster,

like jballard said. just heat the hot end to operating temperature. then you can pull the filament of the hot end. then you will want to clean up the hot end with a piece of ""scotch brite"" pad. it is non conductive and will clean up the residual filament that will be stuck to the hot end. please don't use anything metal, so you don't damage the rambo. scotch brite works well and then you can make sure that the hot end will properly extrude filament once you are done. test the tool head while it is in the air and make sure that it will extrude filament in a straight line. if the filament tries to curl up, then there will be some blockage in the hot end and you will have to do a few ""cold pulls"" to clear it up.
then try another print. 
hope this helps."
issues printing small part,"i am currently trying to print out a small part with my taz 5. the image below shows the original part on the left and my two attempts so far at printing. i used tinkercad to replicate the part. the middle part is printed in abs and the far right part is printed in pla. i am using cura for my software. i did notice that cura is not allowing me to use supports. i believe this is because the part is to small because if i scale it to a bigger size, the supports show up. 

i did attempt a third print using my dual extruder and using dissolvable filament (i used tinkercad to create a box around my part hoping that is would work as a support), but the dissolvable filament was not sticking well at all and was globbing up terribly. i canceled the part after a couple of minutes of printing. 

any advice would be much appreciated. if anyone needs to know individual settings that i used please let me know.

idler arm finally cracked on taz5,"printed up a replacement, around 3 months of use, just thought i'd use this thread to remind users to check if the idler arm is still intact as it can cause filament to stop feeding and grinding.","i had to replace the idler on my mini last night as well. i had already printed an abs replacement using the new design from lulzbot, and swapping it out was pretty easy. i think i'll print another one, and maybe the one coparatech designed as well while i have the abs loaded. might as well have spares. 

another spare that would have been handy was a fan shroud for the heat-break. i replaced the blower with a 25mm fan and it had a connection issue in the middle of a print and stopped. that in turn caused the shroud to melt a bit on the heater block. i cleaned it up, but the shroud was damaged and air leaked out onto the heater, it was only able to maintain about 215c. thankfully, that was enough to print a replacement. now i have a spare one printed as well.

lulzbot taz 6 - bottom layers?,"hello,

i am having frustrating issues with both abs and pla bottom layers print. i can't get it right, it always turns out ugly and i'm not experienced enough to tweak too much around with the settings. however, i did try to change the temp for abs print by -5c as suggested somewhere on the internet, but the bottom few layers are still rough and also signs of squished? or over-extrusion? i am not sure :/ i am still new to 3d printing.

please see my pictures below, i also attached my settings in cura. let me know what should i do.","hi brent, thanks for your suggestion. i printed marvin with tweak as you suggested, lower temp. and higher fan speed at lower layers. however, as you can see in the picture it still failed at bridging on between the legs and the top part of the eye. also you can see some stringing at the top part of the keyhole. it's almost perfect, but not so to get good reviews at 3d hub. i have attached the new cura setting, let me know what went wrong.

the reason why i set initial layer line width at 95% instead of 100% is because i don't want big elephant foot, it makes a lot of my prints ugly. the heated bed is already good with adhesion out of the box, i have no problem with adhesion so far. any suggestion for this fix as well?"
"failed print, messy print head","hi!

i'm a 3d printing beginner. i just received my taz 6 and the rocktopus printed great. but when i tried to print the rock2pus, it did this:



how do i correct the taz to stop doing this?

thanks!","thank you, that gives me a bit more to work with. 

the x axis actually does look pretty level, the other picture showed an angled persective, which i thiought might be one of the motors off, but they look ok. your idler arm spring tension looks good, the carriage looks seated correctly, so mechanically you should be ok. 

you have good starting layer adhesion, and the bed heat settigns look correct since i don't see any lifting. it definitly looks like the nozzle dragged itself through a significant amount of plastic through. i'm guessing one of  a few things happened. 
1. you have the wrong nozzle profile selected. your taz shipped with a 0.50mm nozzle. if you have it set to 0.35mm for example, it will only go up enough to allow for a 0.35mm nozzle each layer, dragging the larger nozzle through the plastic. 
2. your fillament diameter setting is off and you are overextruding. most 3.00mm fillament is actually closer to 2.85mm in diameter. most of the taz profiles have 2.85mm as the base fillament size. if you actually ended up with 3.00 or even 3.12mm fillament, that can cause overextruding. 
3. you have the wrong print material settings loaded. i'm not entirely sure what that green material is, but it may be a hips or ngen sample. the user manual would say what it is, or there might be a sticker on it. the point being that if you have the pla or abs profle loaded, and it's not one of those materials, your printer may not be heating it up enough, or may be overheating it and causeing the mess. 

all is not lost though. heat the printer up to around 190 or so, then shut it off and unplug it. use a pair of rubber handled needle nose pliers to remove any chunks of  plastic still stuck to the nozzle, being careful to avoid the wires going into the heater core (the larger cylender) and the thermistor (the small one) in the rectangular heat block. use a hobby knife or a pokey thing (a nail can work) to get any plastic out of the nozzle crevises.  once the nozzle is reasonably clean power the printer back on, remove the failed print from the bed following the instructions in the manual, and try again. if it does the same thing, it is possible that you have a taz with a bad z axis for some reason, and you should at that point call support for warranty services."
daydreaming??,"hi 
i'm printing a tall thin (2mmx32mm) object using my taz6 and flexystruder  v2 print head.
i'm printing from sd card using the display.
this is a 4 hour print.
things were going good until the print was about 97% complete.
then:
i noticed a gob of filament hanging on the nozzle.
on the 1st iteration of this project, i left the gob on the nozzle and it deposited the gob in a very unfortunate spot.
so
i decided to interrupt the print by using change filament.
the machine stopped and the printhead moved to proper changing position.
i wiped off the gob and pushed resume.
then
the printhead moved to proper position and started to go through the motions of printing.
i could see the extruder gear spinning, but the printhead looked to be to far above the print.
i watched for a few minutes and saw that a few gobs of filament came out of the nozzle, but it was not feeding the filament.
i ended up aborting the print because i did not know what to do.
when i aborted the print, there was a message saying ""day dreaming"" on the display.

i truly believe that i need some instruction on this subject.
any words of wisdom would be appreciated.
thanks
gary","thanks for your comments.
i really need to look into what makes up a gcode file.
..
but
for now, all i' looking for is a procedure that will not cause me a disaster when i see a small gob of filament stuck on the extruder nozzle.
i run my prints from sd card because my printer is located in my woodworking shop.
when using the graphical lcd controller pushbuttons i've pressed pause the print, but that causes a burnt gob to happen in my parts.
on this project, i decided to push the change filament.
the start of that worked good because the print head lifted and moved out of the way of my part.
i think that there was a filament retraction that happened before the print head moved away from my part.
all i did was wipe off the nozzle and push resume.
what part of the procedure was i missing?
i'm thinking that i should have extruded enough material to make up for the retraction that happened when i pushed change filament, 
but it would seem like that should have happened by the taz6 when i said resume.
..
i hope i'm making myself clear here.
i'm very new at this.

simplify 3d frustration,"so i have had my taz 5 for about a month now.  it prints fantastic...when the the printer starts.  

using simplify3d, whenever i try to start printing, the extruder heats up, then the bed. they both reach temperature, but they don't start printing. this is hit or miss. mostly when it is a larger print.

this does not happen when printing from sd card and this does not happen in cura.

i have tuned the pid and this only works temporarily. i have tried the m500 command afterwards and still no go.

this seems to be a problem, but it must not be too common as i haven't found a lot of posts in this forum.

is there anyone who can help?","there may be something else going on if the prints aren't starting when the extruder reaches temp.  i usually keep the check box ticked to wait for extruder to stabilize temp.  i leave the wait for bed to stabilize unchecked.

i don't use s3d to control my printer, only to slice.  but my typical workflow is to heat the bed to 80c, then start the print.  when the extruder reached extrusion temp, the bed should also be close to 110c (abs) and the printer starts printing.  

i use octoprint and upload the gcode files sliced from s3d. to help with pre-heating the bed to 80c, i use a ""before start print script"" with just ""m190 s80"".  when i select the g-code file and hit print, the bed heats to 80c, then the extruder starts to heat (at the same time the bed is continuing to heat to the new temp point of 110c specified in the s3d).  when the extruder stabilizes at 245c, the bed reaches 110c and the print starts."

yes, using the limit switch as a failsafe should work well. you need to wire them in paralell for a normally open (no) setup, not serial, so either one of them can close the loop, and a normally closed (nc) loop would not work well with two switches since the loop would always be closed unless both switches were tripped. you can also build a hard limit into firmware somehow, but i haven't played with that.

extrusion problems,"sorry if this is long winded, i am just inexperienced enough that i'm not sure what details are important. 


our school purchased the taz 5 spring of last year. someone other than myself set the printer up and performed the initial test prints. so now this year, i got the printer, and tried a couple of quick prints of just some basic shapes such as a convergent, divergent rocket nozzle, and it printed fine. so i tried a larger print of a two-part skeleton jaw, using a basic 3.00mm pla filament. the print started out fine, but as time when on, i noticed the print getting stringy and became worse and worse until it was clear the print was a failure. after much frustration and hair pulling, i noticed one of the extruder idler tension screws was not even screwed in. i readjusted the idler tension and tried a test print, thinking it was the problem. now, however, it begins by starting to print the raft, but then skips and jumps around, with the filament balling up and extruding without even being against the bed. pausing the print, i raised it up and noticed the filament was continually extruding. (is that an idler adjustment issue?) 

i've checked a few other places for tutorials and troubleshooting tips but so far, nothing has helped. (for example, i've tried tweaking extrusion speed and having a separate fan on the bed to assist in cooling to solve the stringy problem, but so far i can't even get back to being able to print something big enough to have the stringy problem again.) any ideas?","you could have several potential issues here. to start with, check the bed leveling. let the machine heat to operating temperature, then move the nozzle manually to each of the 4 bed corners, and use a nonflammable metal feeler guage to check that its the same distance from each corner. next run the bedcalib.gcode file from the sd card or download.lulzbot.com and make sure the spacing and thickness is right. then attempt some calibration objects and post them here. 

your idler arm tension springs should have about 8mm space between the washers on either side of the springs. also make sure the fillament can feed smoothly off the roll."
ripples on flat surfaces not from oscillation,"when printing abs on my taz 5 (upgraded from kittaz) i get these irregular surface ripples that start from the first layer and continue through till the end.



  if you look at the bottom of the first layer there seem to be strange printhead jogs that are the source of these ripples.



  the ripples are perpendicular to the direction of printhead travel.  i'm using lulzbot cura 19.12 and the high detail profile on the lulzbot website.  anyone have any ideas on what's going on here?","your initial z height will be slightly too close to the bed. essentially what is happening is there is not enough room for the filament to be extruded. this builds pressure within the hot end, and will slightly raise the hot end to release this pressure. once pressure is released, it drops back down and continues to build again. as the bottom layer infill is so consistent, this pressure will build in approximately the same spot creating a ""wave"" type pattern. a 1/8th to 1/4th turn counter-clockwise of your z axis adjustment screw should get you fixed up. here is another example of the same issue:"
taz 6 auto-leveling ends up too close to buildplate,"we've had this printer working ~8 hours a day for a month and this is a new issue. after auto-leveling the extruder ends up being too close to the buildplate, not leaving even enough room for any filament to come out on the first layers and then smearing progressive layers once it does lay down filament.

i've tried cleaning all the leveling washers with rubbing alcohol, replacing the felt wipe pad and cleaning the nozzle until it almost shines but still no luck. is there a cura setting i'm missing?","i have the exact same issue. any luck figuring it out? out of the blue i am experiencing leveling issues as well. i have heard a weird grinding noise once or twice. today, it was going through the nozzle cleaning about 100mm above the scrub pad? i turned it off and on, reset to factory settings and it cleaned and started ok, but the print is definitely to close to the bed? help??"
"removing gt2, 16 teeth timing pully","i have been trying to remove the gt2 timing pully https://www.lulzbot.com/store/parts/gt2 ... ing-pulley from my x & y axis motors on my taz 6 in order to adjust it for some motor vibration reducers.  i was able to remove the x axis using a 1.25 mm hex wrench with a little work, but the y axis motor's seems stuck on. the set screws are either stripped, the threads in the socket are stripped or both. i tried a fresh, unused 1.25mm wrench, with no change.

it would be nice if that set screws used a larger wrench size, like 1.5 or 2mm.

so would anybody care to recommend a better timing pully replacement that would be easier to adjust, with perhaps larger set screws?

"enclosures and ventilation (of the machine, not the print)","short background:
i recently convinced my employeer that we needed a taz 5. it has been printing nearly daily since we got it--building parts for an enclosure in which it will reside. the enclosure includes a filter for scrubbing the nanoparticles and odors and a blower to do the work. inlets will (for now) simply be ""leaks"" where the panels meet the frame, but it should still maintain some nominal negative pressure. if not, it will be upgraded to more filter flow capacity.

moving on to the point!

the box fits snugly (not too snugly) around the taz 5, but currently does not have any external holes for the electronics enclosure (which clearly has a fan and vent holes). there is probably a 3/4"" gap between those holes and the external wall. 

question 1: will this be enough to satisfy the ventilation (cooling?) requirements for the electronics during a print job? or will things get too toasty? those of you who've built hot boxes will probably know the answer. if i recall, i've seen some with ducts to the electronics fan. temp in my office just inside one of the non-fan holes is about 83f/28c.

question 2: can i shove the power supply in the box too? it's got a substantially loud fan on it and this would quiet it down a bunch. but since it has a fan, i assume it gets warm. too warm? quick thermocouple measurement says it's dumping hot air at around 90f/32c or so which is pretty toasty. 

add the two above to a heated bed and warm lump of plastic and it might be too much. what do you all think?

upgraded taz 4/5/6 color lcd screen,"forgive me in advance if this topic has been covered but i didn't find anything in the comprehensive list of mods thread so i figure it hasn't been asked.

i would love to replace my stock lcd with a nicer (color) lcd.  i've wanted something like this for some time and it occurred to me once again last night as i was looking on ebay for a voltage regulator and came across this cool looking item with an awesome color screen. it seemed to be overkill for the sake of overkill... which is exactly what i would like for my taz.   






i won't lie, the primary reason would be because it would be cool looking but i would also like to extend the cable on it and mount it on the outside of my enclosure and possibly even mount it on a ball joint so i could tilt and position it for easier reading from any position.  bigger text, customizable colors etc.  

has anyone seen a project like this.  also, i'm quite familiar with other solutions like mattercontrol touch and octoprint including the different plugins for touchui etc but neither is quite what i'm after.  also, i print directly from simplify3d and not from the sd card.  i would really just like all of the content seen on the lcd today but on a color screen.  i realize that like has much to do with the firmware, and maybe that's why this doesn't exist yet??  thought it might be an interesting discussion at least.","this one should theoretically work, though the pins it uses might be a bit scattered on the rambo. www.makerbase.com.cn/en/product/detail.php/id-18.html"
new to the taz 6 and hairy prints?,"hi everyone,

i bought myself a taz 6 a couple of months ago - but do to house repairs taking my attention, i haven't been able to get it completely set up until last weekend. it is a very impressive piece of equipment, but i think i need to do a bit of tweaking out of the box to get it to work a bit better.

i have printed 4 roctopuses with the included ngen filament. only one of them was successful. the first three all had the same exact problem. they were so stuck to the bed, that i thought that the glass would break before i pulled them off. i was able to get all of them off the bed, but they all lost their arms in the process and one of them almost felt like it welded itself to the glass. it took a lot of convincing to remove them. so, i figured something was wrong and it wasn't just me. i looked at the roctopus that was included with the taz. it too had a broken arm, but more importantly, i noticed that the bottom of my print had a hard shell (no lines) and the sample that came with the unit looked very different (lines diagonally across). i did a google search and found some posts about the z-axis not being set correctly from the factory. i looked at the skirt and noticed that it was super flat. looked in the adv. configuration and found that the z-axis was around -1.400'ish.

i turned it down to -0.300. the next print's skirt didn't stick so well. in fact, the skirt pulled up and was interfering with the actual print. so, i turned it to -0.749 and it seemed to be just right. it adhered well. finished printing and popped right off with only a few taps of the removal tool. so, my guess is that the roctopus sample was not printed by the printer that i have or whomever printed the sample, over road the machine configuration with cura. either way, i think my machine has some more adjustments that may need to be done.

which brings me to my new issue. all 4 roctopuses (and the included sample) all appear to have a fine webbing between the tentacles and the bull horns of the hand. it is most noticeable on the hand. it appears to be so much so that it has a peach fuzz hair quality to it. unfortunately, the sample that came with the printer had that particular arm broken and missing. however, looking at the sample's tentacles - i am sure that the sample had the same issue. i did some google searches on this and i found that it may have something to do with retraction settings (sucking it back into the extruder?). i saw an eiffel tower piece with the same issue but much more excessive than my own test prints.

at the moment, i am using octoprint on a raspberry pi. i have the ability to hook a laptop to the taz directly and use cura, but i would like to stick to octoprint as the webcam, remote control capabilities are a necessity long term.

does anyone have any suggestions on the webbing issue?","not sure... i was actually really disappointed with my initial print on the taz 6. i actually found a calibration rocktopus on the lulzbot website that prints a really looooong skirt relatively slowly and is meant to be used at the factory for setting the machines z-offset. you can go into the advanced settings and change it while the printer is active so as the skirt was printing i'm slowly rotating the knob to bring the number closer to zero then wait a little bit for the layer height to take effect. after a few adjustments turn the printer off then measure with calipers and go back to the offset that seemed the best. another test print of a regular model, etc. after a few tries i got it to consistently be pretty darn close to the slicer's specified initial layer height. 

i got the mini first, the first print was incredible and i was hooked right away. the build volume as well as the inability to print more than one thing at a time were the two main excuses i kept nagging my wife with to get the 6. my first print experience on the 6 was actually a bit of a letdown and i actually wonder had it come first and the same initial print experience would i have been as excited right from the start. probably so, but just as i tweeted not long ago the mini was just an awesome choice for a first printer.

i think the ngen might be some of the problem with the hairy prints. i did notice a lot more stringiness on my first 6 rocktopus using the ngen than i did on the mini using the supplied hips. even subsequent prints on the 6 using other filaments than ngen. a lot of folks rave about ngen and i know colorfabb makes great stuff, just haven't had the chance to really use any yet. i have about a $1k of filament screaming to be used...

updating taz 5 firmware,"is there a tutorial somewhere how to update taz 5 firmware?  what is the latest version?  where do i download from and how do i flash?

i am trying to see if this will fix the problem i am having with the printer randomly freezing mid-print, but i'm also curious in general.

my printers are currently on marlin 1.0.0.1 which they came with.","updating the firmware of a 3d printer is generally more complicated than it sounds, and isn't generally going to provide a connection fix like a firmware update for a computer motherboard might. think of firmware for a 3d printer as generally something that will change your printing paramaters and occasionally add new features, but its much less about bug fixing than other devices might be.

if your computer is driving the printer, it's more likely that the computer itself is the source of the pauses. if you are driving off the sd card, either a corrupt sd card or a heat issue in the controller box is likely the issue. 

 you can upgrade with the precompiled lulzbot versions, but going with the taz 6 firmware for example would require you to disable the auto bed leveling and change a few bed parameters. you can upload a custom version using the arduino ide and compile it yourself and change configuration.h and whatnot to match your printer configuration. the extruder esteps is going to be different for each printer, and things like the z steps often change from model to model with different leadscrew hardware. 

if you are running a windows computer, make sure your power settings are set to ""high performance"" and the usb ports are set to ""never sleep"""
lulzbot taz 6 end,"hi,

you can say that i am very new to 3d printing, but i covered the slicing and modeling part already. long story short, my lulzbot taz 6 arrived a week ago, and started printing just today. i followed all the guidelines and user manual clearly and print out the rockoctopuss nicely. 

now, as i am really new in this, there is no mention of the finale part about the extruder when the print is done anywhere in the manuals. should it move back up? well, why is it not? the extruder stay way behind and lowered near the print bed. how should i power down the printer? just press the off button to o? should i pull out the filament? what is the step after i removed the print? i believe these are the questions a lot of newbies will ask, and i can't find it anywhere on the forum too. i'm lost after removing the print, all i did is switch off the printer. why do i have a feeling that i'm killing it slowly, and it's not the right post-print step?

the end gcode in the printer profile will tell the print head to go to some position when the print is done. the important thing is that it is off the print so the hotend is not in contact with the part. usually the bed is set to move forward as well to enable removal of the part. the location it goes to is user configurable. the coordinates can be absolute or relative, and are in units which in this case 1 unit = 1mm. if you tell it to go to x10, y200, z 50, the nozzle would move 10mm to the right, 200mm back and 50mm up from the front left bed corner. 

you just power the printer down by turning the power button off. you do not need to remove the fillament. after you remove the print, you clean up any leftover plastic from brim layers, make sure the bed is clean, then play with your new part."
print temp,"i'm having trouble printing benchy. i've researched and experimented, but for the life of me i can't seem to correct it. i assume it's temperature related, but nothing i do works. here's my latest attempt.


























i've watched it print, and have noticed that overhanging areas, like the lower hull section, or the the tops of the arches over the doors, curl up as it's printing. even the top stack was soft and moving around as the nozzle moved. the best i can tell from my research is that this is a temperature related issue, but i've tried high and low extruder temps (215-240), bed temps (100-110), and fan speeds (40/50-80/90), and no matter what combination i use i keep getting the same result.

this attempt was printed with lulzbot hips, nozzle @ 240, bed started at 110 and dropped to 100 after .5 mm, fan speed @ 40-50%. it's also worth mentioning that i'm having trouble with bubbles in my pei sheet (pictures on this thread: viewtopic.php?f=36&t=5133), but since it seems to print the wheel-house walls well enough but still has the same issue at the top of the arches i don't think it's related.

any suggestions?","i had similar issues with the hips and kept trying until i got a good print. try this...
reset your profile by switching back to the hips quickprint (standard) then go back to advanced settings mode again...

change these settings:

print temp to 230
bed temp to 100
filament diameter to 3.05
flow (%) to 100.0
layer height (mm) to 0.2

let me know how that turns out for you. this is black hips printed that way on my mini






i may have changed the initial layer thickness and width as well, can't remember on this one (and not in my notes)."
taz 6 nozzle touches print when printing solid layers,"i have been trying to print smaller and smaller layers and right now i am just trying to .1mm layer high. when i do start printing smaller layers i notice the print head starts to touch the print after a printing a few solid layers and the filament ends up warping a little on the edges while printing but then evens back out once it hits a spot of infill less than 100%. 






i have tried making sure the filament size is correct in cura, messing with the feed setting and setting it lower, lowering the hotend temperature and i have been able to help a little but i am starting to think it may be a physical adjustment on the printer itself any ideas why i would run into this issue the smaller i make the layer heights?","i believe i've seen a ""minimum print time/layer"" setting somewhere in an app which will delay the printing for layers that don't take x seconds to print so you could set it to like 20 seconds and if it takes 5 seconds to do a layer it will pause for 15 more before it continues. i have only used cura and simplify3d but not sure atm where i've seen it. however i'm not sure if that would help because the hotend needs to move away from the small antenna for it to cool more and i think that will just pause for x seconds at the last print point before moving on. that part is so small even when the nozzle is in the middle of the figures head it's still just a cm or so away from the antenna so it might not get a chance to cool enough. i'm really just guessing now. i haven't used that feature but remember seeing it and the description."
taz 6 noise damper?,"has anyone tried installing a damper onto the taz 6 and have any recommendations?

i'm eyeing up picking up a nema 17 motor vibration damper (https://www.lulzbot.com/store/parts/moo ... tor-damper)  but the lulzbot store page says it's only compatible with the lulzbot mini, though i think this is the same motor). not sure if there's any known issues with putting it on the 6?

from what i take on this thread on experiences with installing a damper that installing on the y-axis is the easiest and doesn't require additional modifications on the mini .. would that translate to the taz 6?

yes i have them on my x and y. they were both easy to do. the only issue with the y was mentioned above in that you have to raise the taz up 1/2"" or so off the surface it's sitting on or the stepper won't clear the bottom of the frame, but the x is easy to do and no modifications needed."

new lulzbot taz single extruder tool head v2 (a work of art)
new bearings, linear and axial
fabricated new harnesses (only got 8 pins backwards!!  )
note: my old napa nw 726603 crimpers worked much better than the ratcheting crimper i started with.

loaded firmware and the z would not move ether direction and the y would not move away from switch it also said the y switch was closed when it was not.

assumed the board was fried so i ordered a new rambo 1.3..flashed... switch problem went away. i am ready to burn in the z but i get no z or y movement.

any suggestions?

i have switches all normally open. m119 verified all are opened after i flashed firmware. will check build instructions again for proper pin assignments. i also checked for pins that may have shifted within the connectors. all was well. i have rung from board connector to components.

x, extruder, bed heat, and nozzle heat are working fine. sd card reader sees files.

y growled when i moved it 1mm i have triple checked the board connection. rang out internal cable, extension connector and that the servo wires matched at the extension. also double checked internal and external chassis ground.

z does nothing upon command and rambo flashes red instantly. i can turn z with fingers with power off - not bound.
i operated temp and move axis from the panel menu, not cura.

switched power off when z did nothing. didn't want to make things worse. i was scared to hit home all.   it's got to be something simple that i'm overlooking.

using the latest cura on the latest mac os selecting taz5 with proper nozzle, then click install original firmware.

taz 6 e3d,just a quick question - if i were to upgrade the hotend to the e3d v6 is the overall process the same for the taz 5 extruder or is it a bit more complicated (other than the autolevel sensor). here's the guide on the taz 5 conversion. http://matterhackers.dozuki.com/guide/h ... ot+taz+5/5,oh and i guess which hot end voltage am i looking at - not sure about the heater block voltage

i have a taz 5 and have been printing for a couple of months and was wondering if its possible to dial my settings in any more than what i currently have.

i have started with a benchy in white abs for your viewing pleasure and would appreciate some assistance with dialling this in.

see attached files for those in the know.

i use simplify 3d, have done since i got the printer; research i did prior to my taz purchase said not to bother with cura.

edit: forgot filament type.","[quote=""piercet""][/quote]

thanks man - very detailed, appreciated. 

ok, i have checked/ changed.

1. first layer extrusion set back to 100% from 110%
2. hobbed teeth seem clean and fine.
3. i have tensioned the idler arm by 2mm
4. e-steps are exact @ 100mm extrusion as factory.

see attached picture for proceeding prints.

left: no active cooling, ambient temp 20'c - cancelled due to obvious overheating.
middle: active cooling, ambient temp 20'c - clear layer separation issues.
right: no active cooling, ambient temp 30'c - massive overheating.

is it possible the layer speed isn't allowing passive cooling so its overheating majorly?"
hacking the taz6 to make a larger bed?,"hey guys;

a friend of mine bought a taz6, and i really must say, i'm impressed.  i have a need for one with my business, but unfortunately, i need a larger print area (x, y axis).

has anyone modded their taz6 for say a 16x16 print bed?  i've sourced the heater already, and getting the extruded pieces and thompson rods are no big deal.  having a machine shop make the bed, and buying the glass surface is easy peasy too.

the only difficulty is extending the x/y maximums along with locating the pads for the auto leveling.  i asked lulzbot about making a larger printer, and they said not at this time.  i then asked if they would assist with the coding if i made the mods, and i was ignored.

there is a competing usa made 3d printer of the size i need, for comparable pricing, but i don't like the frame build on that machine.  i much prefer the thompson rod precision of the lulzbot.

thoughts?  ideas?  snide remarks?","piercet wrote:the programming required would just be changing the size of the bed travel inside cura or whatever slicer you want to use, the firmware  bed limits, and potentially electrical values for the larger bed, which may be the tricky part. extending the frame and rods itself would be easy, you just need longer 20mm extrusions and rods. you may run into some deflection issues as you go larger though.

measuring print bed temperature,"hi there, i just got my taz 6 a couple days ago and am in the process of dialing it in.  ive printed several cubes (1""x1""x1"") using pla and abs using the stock configurations available in taz 6 and have noticed some warping on all prints up to the bottom layer thickness.  once past that it gets better.  also having what appears to be some retraction issues but that is a different topic.  so i pulled out my trusty fluke 62max ir thermometer to see if the print bed is getting up to the right temps.  during the current test print the bed is set to 110c which is 230f.  depending where i measure on the bed the temps range from 221f to 245f.  has any one else tested their beds with sim results?  any insight is appreciated!","that's normal. you can see the flir camera image of the bed here in the forums if you do a search for it, or in some of the taz 5 bed review pictures. the heater element in the taz 6 is identical to the taz 5 one.  a metal bed plate can improve the heat spread but they are slightly difficult to find flat ones."
"pei bed burnt, cracked, & peeled","ok after seeing the t-800 print from another thread, and having a lot of success with my current setup (after moving) i decided to give it a shot.  i also wanted to try my hand with a print from sd card for gcode i create from cura.  

well, the print went well mostly.   48 hours.  .15 layer height, abs, 228 nozzle temp, 100 print bed, 20% infill.   

the print was good.  some z banding (which i've never been able to get rid of entirely).  i had a small z shift half way up.   the main issue i had where cracking at various layers, so i thought.  after removing the print i tore the pei right off, which was burnt along with the bottom of the abs.   im guessing 100 was too high.  (i now recall an updated recommendation of 85 degree for abs). 

images attached 

my big question now - how do i repair the printer bed?   is this just a matter of pealing the rest off, cleaning the glass, and replacing the sheet?    are there instructions available (haven't looked yet)?   do i need to be concerned with any other possible damage?  

ps taz 5 printer.","the temperature was a little too high for the grey plastic, but it should have been fine for the pei sheet. that looks like it was up closer to 120. the main reason the pei probably failed was due to removal technique. grey abs tends to discolor above 235 or 95 on the bed. it's cosmetic, and you can generally ignore it or sand it off. to remove that part properly though, you need to use a careful wedgeing action around all edges at approximatly 60 degrees. fully cool parts are actually harder to remove. the removal tool of choice varies, many people use paint scrapers. i personally use this cheese slicer: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/b000sdqgl6/ with the slicy part taped over with heavy gorilla tape. the thin leading edge which is dull at the front, but thin enough to get under almost any part, and reinforced at the sides is basically the ideal 3d printer part removal tool. i keep trying to get someone to make them without the cheese slicer part, but so far no luck. 

as far as replacing the pei, you're in luck, it's a fairly easy process with two paths you can take. 1. you can remove the existing pei and adhesive and replace it for $45 https://www.lulzbot.com/store/parts/lul ... -pei-sheet . the process to do that involves freezing the entire build plate for an hour or so to cause the adhesive to relax, carefully removing the remaining pei, using a citrus based adhesive remover (such as goof off) to remove just the pei adhesive from the pei side of the glass (and being extra careful to keep it away from the heater side), then cleaning the glass very well twice with glass cleaner and adhering the new sheet. 

you can also just buy a new bed heater and glass pei sandwich assembly: https://itworks3d.com/product/lulzbot-t ... ter-glass/ the blemished ones go for $49 or so. 

to properly remove a part, wait for the bed temperature to lower to 60, or reheat it to 60, then starting at a corner, work your removal tool under the brim or part edge, being careful to not gauge the bed. then slowly work your way around the edges and towards the center, striving to wedge the part away rather than pull it up off the bed. if you end up with a discolored white spot under the part, thats an air bubble and it means you didn't do it correctly. next time you print that will act as an insulator, and either make things not stick correctly, or trap heat and cook your pei. you may also have been slightly too close to the bed, though for a tall print like that it's better to err on closer. 

edit: you shouldn't be too worried about other damage. you'll want to check the bed for level/tram once you reinstall things, and maybe look to see if a rod looks visibly bent or anything like that, but that would be rare. 

hope that helps!"
igus bushing clip/sleeve,"has anyone tried putting a circlip or putting a metal sleeve over the igus bushing to try and pull the slop out?  i know igus wants them to be put in metal retainers and the printed parts are oversized to try and compensate for this.  i know lulzbot has spent a lot of time deciding on the igus or bronze sleeves or linear bearings, so maybe they have tried something like this.  i also know you can upgrade to a openrail or similar linear guide, but there has to be a way to solve this problem without having to invest another couple hundred.","i assume you are referring to the fact that the igus bearings are designed to be a press-fit and that the plastic lulzbot parts are not precise enough to achieve this. thus in reality the igus bearings are not really being used correctly in most 3d printers?

an interesting question if that's really what you are getting at. to answer you question no, i built mine from scratch and am currently using lm8uu bearings in mine, but they are horrible and i am going to print / replace mine to igus-style bushings soon out of i180 tribo filament. i'm personally not all that worried about the press-fit thing. to me it's a ""good-enough"" situation, but i am curious to see what you come up with and/or the responses you get.

i have been toying with the idea of having the plastic lulzbot parts cnc machined out of aluminum. not necessarily for press-fit tolerances for the bearings, but for aesthetic reasons. i mean come on it would just be cool."
solved: taz 5 shifting first couple of layers,"i don't recall when this started or whether it's been doing this since i got the printer and i'm only really noticing it now.

the first 2.5mm or so of all prints are slightly shifted on every single print that i do. the shift happens both in x and y but oddly, it's not the same distance of shift on both sides of the print.

i've attached a bunch of pics because i can't come up with decent words to describe it. i've tried playing with belt tightness on the x axis and nothing has changed.

this print was pla but i get the same issue when i print with abs too. temperature variation doesn't make a difference, neither does slowing it down.

any ideas?","dougz wrote:i'm curious what would happen if you bump the filament diameter to 3.0mm, flow to 100%, and start the fan on full at layer 2 (for the pla at least.
the print i showed is black formfutura - i've measured the filament diameter and it's the 2.79mm average from measuring over a 11 points so i suppose i could up the flow marginally since it's currently at 100%. fan turns on on the second layer with pla and not at all with abs.

i would disagree because after it gets to about 2.5mm on the z, it straightens out and prints nicely from then up with no change to anything

possibly but it doesn't seem to make a difference with different temperatures or filaments.

switching to .35mm hot end,"i've just ordered a .35mm hot end for my taz 6. i'm wondering what changes i'll need to make in cura if i'm starting with the proper .5mm profile for my filament. of course, i'll change the nozzle diameter.  speed? layer thickness?  has anyone been through this transition?

extruder calibration frustrations,"greetings,

i recently began to work with bridge nylon filament on my taz 5. i haven't made any hardware modifications, nor have i updated the firmware. i'm starting to take tolerances into account, so i decided i would look at proper calibration. i also understand that a nylon filament might not be the best to calibrate with, however, i will be predominantly printing in nylon, so it seems sensible to calibrate for it.

calibrating the extruder is quite frustrating and tweaking the esteps seems completely arbitrary on my machine. i've been following the ohai guide. my esteps was set to 860 by default. for the following results, i ran 100mm length and 100 mm/m speed five times, then took the average. at an esteps of 860, it was typically under-extruding by 55-60mm. at an esteps of 760, it under-extruded by 50mm. at an esteps of 660, it under-extruded by 50mm.

since that wasn't making much of a difference, i went in the other direction. at an esteps of 1060, it under-extruded by 50mm on average. i've even cranked it to an esteps as high as 1460 (under by 100mm) and as low as 460 (under by 55mm) and my results got me no closer to a calibration. every time it would under-extrude. i've also raised and lowered the extrusion speed and i'm still getting wildly inconsistent results.

i'm hoping there is some obvious thing i'm doing wrong. i'm sure i need to provide more information, but i'd appreciate a push in the right direction.","in the hopes of helping someone who might come across this thread later, one thing to keep in mind is that while calibrating in pronterface, we are using an extrusion speed that is measured in mm/m. so if i plan on doing my standard bridge nylon prints at 50 mm/s in cura, that would be around 3000 mm/m. is this correct?

so if lulzbot tells me to use 100mm and 100 mm/m, it seems like deviating from that will make it harder to be consistent in how we calibrate. i feel like we should be limiting the variables, not adding more. since this kind of extruder calibration is taking into account the amount of filament fed into the extruder and not the amount actually extruded, do we really need to consider the desirable cura printing speed of a filament?

i will begin looking around for information on the idler tension and those additional suggestions. i understand that some of my assumptions in this post might be way off. i'm only just beginning to get a decent grasp of these concepts. up to this point i've been satisfied with the stock calibration and the standard lulzbot cura profiles. however, since i'm getting into custom gearing, i need to be able to anticipate tolerances in order to make sure a print comes out how i need it to."
consistent jams with pla on taz6 heat creep issues,"hey guys, new owner to the lulzbot line of printers though i've used them before.  i have a taz6 and after about 20 hours of successful prints, i've been having consistent issues with continuing prints.  for the first 2-3  hours, the printer works just fine but anything longer than that, jams seem to occur where the filament gets melted and jammed up on the grub screw in the extruder.  forcing it down doesn't work as its firmly implanted into the grub screw area and sides so the only option is to disassemble and unscrew the grub screw from the hotend and remove the filament from it.  all fans are functional, i don't have any other material to test with but the test filament worked just fine (though shorter print times) and now with my pla, its been nothing but issues after a few hours.  i've read heat creep being an issue on the 5 and people fixing it with 40mm fans but not much on the taz6.  i'm using simplify3d on default settings for the taz6, print between 60-80mm/s, 60,70, and 80 all failing due to the same issue, temps set to the manufacturers suggested temps.","the taz 6 has a larger fan on the barrel, so it generally isn't subject to the same fan issue the taz 5 had with the partially failing squirrel cage fans. you do want to verify that the middle fan is operational and running constantly. it is possible to overcool your nozzle block and cause jamming. overextrusion can also cause jamming by making the part surface too close to the nozzle. crappy filament can also cause similar effects. 

if it seems to be a hardware issue though, you should definitely call support since you are under warranty."

too much rocktopus settings,"hey all,

i've had the taz 5 for about 9 months and i actually printed for the first time from the sd card the other day (toying around).  i printed the too much rocktopus print with abs.  i was surprised at the speed/size of the print.  i was wondering if anyone knows what the equiv. settings in cura would be (basic stuff like print speed, layer height, infill %, etc.).  i have been focused more on slower quality prints, but was pleasantly surprised with the speed/quality ratio i got from that run. 

just curious.","yup. from inside cura, change to advanced settings, then on the file menu select ""load settings from gcode file"" and locate the file you're referring to on the sd card. it won't load the model on the virtual print bed but it will load the print settings on the tabs for you. you can then choose file -> save profile and save the print settings using the file name of your choice."

so it begs the question what if i am not so lucky getting the machine back working enough next time to create a replacement part.

head shoot to top of z axis after prints,"i am not sure what happened but i flashed the firmware of my taz5 and it seems like i am having 2 issues. 

1) the printhead shoots to the very top of the z axis after prints and i find this annoying. is there some code i can tweak in cura before saving my gcode to maybe just lift the head 10mm off the print and stop? where is this code found in cura?

2) the left stepper motor and right motor must not be isync because the left side ends much higher than the right. any suggestions? is there a hardware or motor issue or can this be in the code?

thanks a lot!

chris","the z axis not level issue is usually going to either be hardware or allignment. to get them bacl where they should be, run the z axis down to the bottom, then power off the machine and unplug the z motors to prevent electromagnetic pulse back into the board. now manually turn the right hand motor until the distance with calipers from the top of the lower z axis bearing to the bottom of the z axis leadscrew nut on that side is identical to the measurement from the other side. then reconnect the motors and power the printer back on. then re-level your bed. you will also want to check for a loose z axis motor coupler. you should have at least one of the two setscrews per top or bottom of the coupler resting in the center of the flat spot on the motor shaft and the leadscrew shaft, with the other screw on each side down tight. if any setscrews are missing, replace them before operating the z axis. 

after that, lubricate the z axis leadscrews (and just the leadscrews, not the smooth rods) with white lithium grease. then run the carriage up and down a few times. if the issue occurs again you either have another allignment issue, a failing z motor, or your measurement was off. check that the leadscrews are up and tight to the top of the upper bearing, and the lower z motor mounts are all the way up and the same height on both sides. then check for frame square. you may want to also try loosening the idler side x axis rod retaining bolts and running the z axis up and down a few times to make sure that isn't pinched or bowed out."
taz 6 - z offset & level issue,"hey guys, looking for some advice here. i own two taz 6's that i use nearly 12 hours a day, every day. i find myself constantly fighting the leveling & having to adjust the z-offset. every time i start a new print, it's either too low or too high. it is never as level as i'd like. i print on most of the bed area so a level bed is crucial. both of the printers do this, so i don't think it's an isolated issue. does anyone else have this problem, and if so, have you found a way to fix it? i clean the print head after every finished print and it doesn't really help. why lulzbot decided to use the print head as the leveling sensor is beyond me. why not use a standalone probe that doesn't get plastic all over it??","jjones86 wrote:hey guys, looking for some advice here. i own two taz 6's that i use nearly 12 hours a day, every day. i find myself constantly fighting the leveling & having to adjust the z-offset. every time i start a new print, it's either too low or too high. it is never as level as i'd like. i print on most of the bed area so a level bed is crucial.

all i'm asking this, is because i have found out that different material, many times, require from me to adjust the first layer thickness. for some reasons, unknown to me, when i switch between abs, pla, petg, pett, ngen, nylon and some others, i need to adjust in the slicer the first layer thickness, otherwise i come across the same problems you describe. added to that, the fact that i have an e3d and i'm constantly swapping nozzle sizes   

so, if that's your case (different materials) then i think you only need to check and mark in your slicer the desired first layer thickness for each type of filament..."
layer consistency,"hey guys. so been printing great for a while and all of a sudden the prints are coming out kinda funny lookin. nothing has changed and before i was getting way better surface finish. 

see pics below. printed on taz 6 using n-gen high quality settings. almost looks like uneven extrusion. possibly over extrusion? odd since nothing changed in settings haha. any suggestions would be helpful. results are really the same on s3d and cura. tried pla and n-gen with similar results. don't think it's z wobble as that tends to be one sided and more consistent. belts are all tensioned correctly etc. 




","hey cjay,

it may be a couple of things that you are dealing with. one of them may be that the hot end is over extruding a bit. you can check your esteps and see if that is the case. there is a calibration guide at https://ohai.lulzbot.com/group/calibration/  i would check that first just to see.
 i agree that it doesn't look like z wobble, but what if the x gantry is binding just a bit as it moves up the z axis. if this is the case, you can loosen the 2 allen head screws on each side of the x gantry. 2 are on the z axis motor and 2 are on the z axis idler, on opposite sides of the printer. both go down through the conical shaped guides that the lead screws go through. just loosen them a bit and run your next print with them slightly loose and see if it helps. this will allow less resistance on the z axis moving up and down.
just a possibility."
taz 5 fr control,"i'm trying to print emmett's geared bearing -
http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:53451
my taz is well calibrated, but i've mostly printed with abs to this point.
i have a nice roll of lulzbot pla so i decided to give it a shot.
(i haven't checked calibration with the pla yet)
the bearing (planetary gears) is printed all at once so close tolerances are very important.
the first try was fused solid (over-extrusion?).
i tried lowering the fr via the taz control panel to 95% - still fused.
again at 90% and i was able to free the parts fairly well (still a few rough spots) with judicious application of maxwell's silver hammer....
i still need to print this so that all of the parts are separate as they print. 
my question is what does this fr control actually do?
it seems that reducing the flow of filament 10% is pretty drastic.
i have a feeling that i'm not understanding what this control does.
i am pretty sure i can lower the extrusion rate in cura, but am curious about the fr control.
any other suggestions would be welcome.



best regards,
pch","yeah that gear bearing is incredably difficult to print in abs compared to pla. i say this as someone with 3 of the abs ones sitting on my desk here at work. 

feed rate is the rate at which the extruder pushes fillament into the hotend but also all the other motion axis. increasing this number increases the speed the printer moves in all axis. in a perfectly calibrated machine, a feedrate of 100% on an extruder that is set to extrude 100mm of fillament would send 100mm worth of fillament into the hotend. in actual practice, the calibration of the extruder might be off, or the calibration is correct and the fillament diameter setting is off, so people tend to use feedrate to compensate for other issues. for example, if your extruder is calibrated perfectly but you are sending 3.2mm fillament down the extruder when it thinks you are sending 2.85mm fillament, you would be overextruding. lowering the feedrate to 85% would appear to compensate for that, but it would be a workaround rather than the actual fix of measuring the fillament diameter and inserting the correct diameter value. flow rate on the other hand just adjusts the amount of plastic extruded. 

with pla, cooling issues can also falsly show up as overextrusion sometimes, since overheated pla tends to expand. a part without adequate fan, or a part printed with a failing barrel fan will show up as lumpy and slightly oversized even if the actual extrusion amount is fine. 

if your extruder calibration is fine, check your fillament diameter setting against your actual fillament, increase your cooling, and verify the small barrel blower fan on a taz 5 is still functional. they sometimes fail in partially working, but too low of flow mode.

edit: clarified things. nickp is correct."
need to replace filament mid print with filament that arrives tomorrow,"hey,  i couldn't find my exact problem, so here goes.  

i am 75% done with an 80+ hour print and i am about to run out of filament (i know, that's probably way longer than i should run it).  i thought i had enough, but i don't.  anyway, my new spool arrives tomorrow evening and its going to run out tonight.  i am running off the sd card with gcode made in cura.  is there a way to pause the print where it sits and let it sit for a day until my new spool comes in tomorrow?  i don't want to throw this print away due to the time involved.

thanks for the help!

minor print gliches in taz6,"i am currently a mini owner and love it but i am starting to find i want to print objects larger that a 6in cube so looking at getting the taz 6 since it looks to be the daddy to the mini with all the bed leveling features and head cleaning but with a dual extruder option. did some looking online for reviews of it but only found people who reviewed the pre release models and they ran into some minor printing issues that said could be fixed by the time it was released. 

that was in may but now i can't find anyone who has gone back and reviewed it since then so i just wanted to know did lulzbot get all the kinks worked out that were issues in the builds that the reviewers were using? if you need examples of what those issues were i will go back and see what they were, i am just lazy and wanted to avoid having to go back through all the reviews i looked at. 

i do know the belt that ran the bed was one issue and the extruder felt loose and the z-axis had some issues.","@shawnbot, yes, the 6 feel slower, but at the same time i also feel like it feels slower because it has twice the distance to travel (ie during the probing sequence). but for prints, not it doesn't seem 5x slower. i was reading your earlier post as i was getting off an airplane earlier today otherwise i would have put together a quick print off between the two. i will be back home thursday night and can print the same thing on both printers. i'll load something up in cura, maybe the 3dhubs marvin keychain, set it on quickprint - standard - pla. save the gcode to an sd card for the 6 then switch it to the mini and print it directly via usb and see how long each one takes. 

regarding bed adhesion, what is your current z offset? the lulzbot green filament sample that came with your 6 should have been colorfabb ngen, not pla. if you used pla settings for the initial rocktopus that may explain the issues there as the ngen should be 230 and the bed at 85. however you said you tried actual hatchbox pla and still experienced the same issues. 

the reason i suggest you check the z-offset in the firmware (you can check it via the taz 6 control panel, as well as the cura control windows with the m501 command) is that my z-offset from the factory was way off. i was actually a little disappointed after the first taz6 rocktopus experience. i could barely get it off the bed, i had to scrape at the skirt to get it off in tiny bits it was really smooshed smooshed down. there was even an outline of the rocktopus lightly carved into the surface of the pei bed. i used some 2000 grit sandpaper to get rid of it.

my z-offset was -1.350 from the factory. i added .2 to make it -1.150 (go closer to zero to move the nozzle away from the bed). that was too much and i've settled at -.1250. .1mm doesn't sound like a lot but it seems to have made a huge difference for me. i habbitually measure the skirts and they're typically right on the money with my slicer settings. 

so i'd check your z-offset to start and adjust as necessary."
print stopping in the middle of a print,"hi -

i'm printing a relatively large object (maybe 5 in x 3 in x 3in), and during the last two print attempts the print has stopped mid-print several hours into the print process - and at different points on the print (at different heights, different locations on the print bed and different points in the model). the head stops moving and extruding and the bed stops moving, and the object ends up with a little 'dimple' of abs where the print head stopped.

does anyone have a suggestion as to how to debug this? i've successfully printed this model several times over the past couple days. after that i made a slight model tweak, but the print didn't fail at that changed point in the model either time (in x, y or z) - it failed at different x@y@z each time.











thanks,

- chris","dougz wrote:i had something similar, except my print (also from sd card) failed in literally the same spot (on the z-axis, and i think the x) both times. on two different .gcode files for different models (but they were of similar shape). these were failures many hours in each time. i was able to continue from where it left off as i just sunk the model below the bed using the z value shown on the taz6 display then glued the two pieces together. but if you place the two parts side by side from both failures you see them glued line at the exact same height in the print. again these were two different .gcode files of different sliced stl models. 

i entered a support ticket with lulzbot but didn't get very far. they thought it was binding up on the z-axis and provided great resolution steps if that were the problem, but it goes all the way & down like a dream. didn't hear back from them but will follow up.

here's where mine stopped on the second model (didn't take pics of the first one). notice it was just over 16 hours (print speed was set very slow) but also notice the nozzle temp and bed temp in the second photo...
pic1.jpgpic2.jpgpic3.jpg

if you are printing from the sdcard and the print stops at the exact same spot, it's not z axis binding. it's either a corrupt file, or a bad sector on the sd card. possibly overheating as well, but thatsm not likely. try replacing the sd card, make sure you get an actual sd card, not a mini sd card in an adaptor."
taz 5 pei plate bubbling?,"the bed of my taz 5 has began to form bubbles or ""air pockets"" all over he bed. these pockets are effecting the part adhesion to the bed drastically and causing the prints to detatch from hte bed. has anybody else experienced this? what should i do?","menissalt wrote:are yall following the bed removal temperature guide?

clean bed
abs - 50
pla - 45
hips - 50
laywood - 45
laybrick - 45

gluestick - gluestick is required for these materials or they can bond to the pei
t-glase (pet) - 45
fliexible filament - 35
nylon - 50
polycarbonate - 50
n-vent - 50

you shouldn't let any print cool down all the way before removing it (i learned the hard way and was corrected by support). if your print can't be pried off chances are it's cooling down too much and/or is squished too close to the bed.

you should have this as part of your ending script:
code: select allm140 s** ; turn bed to **c

replacing ** with your needed temp. so for pla it would read:
code: select allm140 s45 ; turn bed to 45c

note that this will keep your bed on until you manually turn it off. this will greatly help save your pei bed. it's also a good idea to rotate parts around the build plate.

i second menissalt. i added this code to my end g-code after my 3rd bed replacement:
code: select allm190 r50                       ; wait for bed to cool to abs removal temp
g1 x145 y175 z156 f1000         ; move to cooling positioning
m140 s50                        ; turn bed temp to abs removal temp
m84                             ; steppers off
g4 s21600                       ; hold bed temp for 6 hours (hours*3600)  s<time in seconds>
m140 s0                         ;shut off heated bed

the only two things that might change print to print. one is change the bed temp on lines 1 and 3 to the removal bed temp for whatever material you're using. second, i added a small line of code for the number of seconds the bed should wait before turning off. this is really just there as a safety measure if i leave the house for days on end and forget i had a print going so eventually it will shut off. the value for this is in seconds. this is useful if you know a print is going to finish about 3am and you'd like it to hold the bed temperature until at least 8am. i have mine set for 6-8 hours which works great if the print finishes right after i hit the sack.

i've also been trying better removal techniques than prying up on the corner of a thick part. if the part is taller, i hit it lightly on all sides with the blue end of the knife and that helps loosen most parts up nicely so that no prying is needed. so far after many prints the bed still looks new. hopefully i'm onto something here. hope this helps!

taz 5 extruded filament buildup,"a couple hours into a build i found two spots of filament buildup on the edges of the print. could anyone help me figure out what is causing this?

also, upon clicking pause in cura, the lulzbot takes a couple minutes to finally come to a stop. is that normal?

thanks in advance for any help, i'd appreciate it.","nopick wrote:i think the nozzle might be plowing through the over extruded filament causing plastic to build up and eventually come off of the nozzle as a nice glob.

have you measured you filament diameter and entered that value in the slicer? if so, you might need to tweak the extrusion multiplier in the slicer a little. if you are at 100%, give 95% a try and see if the top surface of the part cleans up.

i have another print running right now so that i will be able to see if the problem reoccurs. if it does i will begin changing the extrusion settings as you have described.

(heated) enclosure for taz 6?,"hi guys,
new to 3d printing here and running a taz 6. apologies if this has been answered before, but i couldn't really find any answers on the forum specific to taz 6.

printing primarily with abs and running into plenty of warping since my parts are pretty big (car parts, abs due to lowest cost & higher glass transition temp than pla, please correct me if i'm wrong)

has anyone done a heated enclosure (or just an enclosure) for the taz 6?
how did you set it up?
did you build an enclosure around the print area only like this?
https://printedsolid.com/products/lulzbotenclosure

or did you enclose the entire printer?

i also heard that you should vent the electronics in order to avoid frying the rambo board, how do i go about doing this for the taz 6?
how about the stepper motor? i heard that they will fry if its too hot in the enclosure too.

would prefer not to split the print into separate parts as much as possible in order to avoid incurring additional labor cost.

i heard from #reprap irc that the optimal enclosure temperature is 60 degrees celcius, whats your thoughts on this?
is it necessary or will just an enclosure heated by the ambient heat from the bed and hot end be enough?

i also wish to install octoprint with a raspberry pi 3 with the camera module, how should i go about doing this?

i saw from the world first 3d printed kayak on youtube that the guy used these aluminum things to set up his heated chamber instead of the acrylic like many enclosures around. what's your thoughts on this?
http://www.grassrootsengineering.com/bl ... g_2030.jpg

thanks for taking the time to read and apologies for the many questions. i wish to learn as much as possible from the very experienced community here!","hi

i've got a taz 5 and was running into the same problems with warping on large abs parts (i also require the higher glass transition temps). i have bought some nylon to try but i built an enclosure anyway. i really like some aspects of the hotbox enclosure (https://grabcad.com/library/hotbox-diy- ... printing-1) - the documentation is great, but i'm not keen on the hinged door as i often want to stick my hand in to clean any mess off the nozzle just before printing starts, for example, so i decided a sliding acrylic front door would be a better bet, as it doesn't pull the hot air out as you open it.

here's a link to a few photos of mine:
https://drive.google.com/folderview?id= ... sp=sharing

i can upload the cad files too if anyone is interested - i got it cut from 6mm mdf and it went together nicely. they cad is done in inventor.

otherwise it's doing a good job. there's no heater - it just relies on the thermal input from the bed and extruder and gets to around 58°c. there are some drafts getting in, mainly around the door and electronics box, and more insulation needs adding in a few places. the warping has almost all disappeared, but isn't perfect. i'm not sure whether that's to do with the average temp not being high enough or occasional drafts in there.

other things:
* it has a sliding opening for the filament to feed through to keep a reasonable seal around the filament as it enters the enclosure.
* the idea for the cut-outs at the top is to allow for springs to counter the acrylic door but i haven't printed them yet.

other issues:
* basically, i should have made it slightly bigger internally, as i designed it for thinner insulation than i ended up using. i think 25mm foil-covered celotex is ideal, whereas in places i've had to use foil/bubble wrap insulation.
* the hole on the left-side for the electronics is slightly too high too - i had to print some feet to raise the printer by 6mm.
* i haven't finished designing a lock to hold the door up yet."
whats going on in this ngen print?,"i am using 230/85 and everything on my taz5 seems to be dialed in. 

any suggestions?","been printing with ngen lately. you've probably done this, but check the following:

1. use the lulzbot supplied ngen profile as a starting point. worked great on my mini.

2. print a skirt and measure the skirt thickness. it should be roughly 0.425 if you're using the standard profile. if your head is too high, you'd get material releasing from the bed. too close and you'd get material smooshed out like it kinda looks like you have.

3. measure your filament diameter and make sure it matches your slicer so you're not over extruding.

start there and we can move from there.

switching off cooling fan mid print in cura?,have several tricky abs prints with small footprints but large overhangs that have a tendency to squish down on the lower layers due to weight. to combat that i lowered the bed temp after 3-5mm from 110c to 70c and bumped up the fan speed to 70% which works great. however it's cooling down the print too much further up the model leading to cracks - can i reduce the fan speed mid print or do i have to manually edit the g-code?,"there aren't buttons to control the cooling but i have adjusted the cooling manually using the commend entry in the cura control panel. during the print you can enter the command referenced in the post above (""m106 s0"" will turn the fan off). just type it into the command box in the lower right and press enter. it won't take effect immediately but should within 10~15 seconds or so."
help. taz 5 head pulls up already laid filament,"i am noticing as my head travels it pulls up the filament that has already been laid. the bed is leveled and the print head is aligned correctly. i so far noticed this with pla and abs. what do i need to look at ? i am using the standard print profiles provided in cura and i am not sure what to look for next. my bed temperatures are standard too. is this a retraction issue? i was thinking the filament is not hot enough so when the head goes to travel it can't detach the filament. maybe i should raise head temp?

what do you guys think?

thanks a lot.

chris","well my z height is tight. the paper has a lot of resistance between the bed and the nozzle head. i don't think z height is the issue. maybe retraction speed?? i don't think this is the issue because i am using the cura defaults for everything.

taz 4 to e3d light,"i got tired of pla leaking between the extension and the peek area on the stock taz 4 hot end. i don't need high temp ability right now so i thought i would try the e3d light. that also means i am doing a conversion to 1.75mm. i printed a mount off thingiverse so it can bolt up to the extruder. i bought the taz 5 harness and internal blower harness add on. so that would get my wiring up to taz 5 standards. 

the e3d i ordered was with 24v heater and fan. do i need to get a replacement 5v fan to mount on the hot end shroud? 

will the harness changes and flashing the firmware as if upgrading to a taz5 tool head keep me from going back to the old way if things don't work out?

i want to keep some of the original tool head parts as is, so i am printing replacements. one thought i had was print the flexystruder body. the e3d light has a ptfe tube that runs all the way though the hot end to the nozzle and extends out the top. since i am needing that anyways it seems like it supporting the filament all the way through the extruder is a good way to go. 

or should i just print another standard extruder body and just run the ptfe to the bottom of the bolt and use a 1.75 guide on the top (from the adafruit 1.75 conversion parts)? would using the standard bearings pressing the filament into the extruder bolt work better with normal filaments especially on retraction then the flexystruder setup?

any thoughts on this?

thanks guys!","the e3d light hot end uses the same mount as the v6 model. the only difference is that its limited to pla/abs temps since it has a ptfe tube that runs though the body of the hot end and the cooling fins are stainless steel not aluminum. e3d says the v6 is a direct replacement if i want to upgrade that later. i did print a nice mount (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:971339) that holds the hot end really well, or at least it seems like it. when i compare the length of mount plus e3d it seems to be about the same length as my budaschozzle. 

it seems like your mounting plate is for the taz5 extruder body. the taz4 extruder body is flat on the bottom and would not let that plate design sit flat to the extruder.

i did print it in pla but high temp pla that prints at 230c which is what the abs i used way back also printed at. 

i thought the firmware update was required for the taz4 to use a taz5 style tool head. i understand the e3d uses the same temp probe as the taz5 so would match other then doing the pid calibration so maybe if i had a taz5 the update would not have been needed?"

sd card not being read...,"hello helpful people...

i can’t find the sd card that came with the printer but downloaded the .gcode file for the print bed leveling. put the card into the reader slot, and on the display it says card inserted, or something similar. when i go to the menus option, it says “card xx” (i think, or something similar) but doesn’t list anything being on the card. then it says there is no card.

with the makerbot units i am use to, any .stl or .gcode file comes up from any card you seem to slap in there. does this need to be formatted in some fashion? i can’t find anything that explains why the card or the .gcode wouldn’t be read. it concerns me as i don’t want to tie up a computer for printing.

converting to e3d-v6 hotend,"ok, i am going to do this and already ordered the e3d-v6 hotend (genuine not a copy) and an aluminum mounting plate for the e3d (didn't want to go to a printed one, it just feels like metal is needed here).

i know i need to auto tune pid.... <i think i can look this one up>

i can wire it in (already have extra plugs/pins).

so am i missing anything? it seems pretty straight forward, is the included 100k semitec ntc thermistor plug & play or do i need to change something in the firmware? i am a hardware and electronics guy and i can barely do software if i have step by step instructions.

is there a better fan shroud than the one i linked to?

thanks for any input.","well the conversion to e3d-v6 is complete.

i did have to make my own filament fan shroud as both the ones i got on thingiverse were not the right height. piercet yours was too high up and could not be bolted to the original mount (i did not want to reprint the entire set you made). the other i got (linked to in first post) was actually too low and it would have crashed into the bed.

also i ended up printing the e3d mount myself as the nice aluminum one i bought was very sloppy and i didn't want that. i made my own and made it fit very snug (i posted it on thingiverse if anybody wants it http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1749234 ).

in the end the only other thing i had to do was run the pid auto tune (it was hard to find instructions but easy to do once i did).

i have only printed a few things so far and all in abs but i am hoping that pla has no more heat creep issues.

taz 6 power consuumption,"how much power does the lulzbot taz 6 use when printing? i started a print and there was either a power out or a electricity-surge which reset the computer so i had to start the print over   . so now i want to get a ups with surge protection but i don""t which is best for the taz 6. thx","for surge protection, you really need it normally to cover at most, say 1 minute of time, but must be capable of supplying the full power for that minute.

i have a taz 6, and these are actual measurements. the power used by each electrical component are;
support electronics about 9 watts, 19 va
bed heater - about 325 watts, 350 va
each extruder heater - about 30 watts, 32 va (times 2 for dual extruders)
motors - about 26 watts, 30 va

thus the worst case power usage is about 430 watts, 465 va. of course, your mileage may vary. for my raspberry pi 3 and octoprint, i would add another 10 to 15 watts.

hence a 500 va unit would probably be good enough.

i might add, the average power usage for a print is much less, especially in an enclosure. once the heaters are at temperature, there is little power usage maintaining the temperature. i know i had some measurements, but can't seem to find them right now, but something like 110 watts rings a bell."

anyway, this got me thinking, i have a taz 6 and was about to go looking to see if there is an update firmware for my version (olive), but how does one know whether a firmware update is ok to use, other than its simple existence for download but no accompanying docs (http://devel.lulzbot.com/taz/olive/software/firmware/)?

2. the belt pulley is not tight on the motor shaft. the small setscrews sometimes work loose in shipping. check the pulley and ensure that there is at least one setscrew is on the flat spot of the motor shaft, and the secondary setscrew (if the taz 6 pulley has one) is also down and tight.
3. the rambo board is overheating due to a failed fan, or a heat sink chip that fell off the y axis motor. if the other two causes are not the issue, call support before opening the control box."
"electrical issues with taz 5: printer ""reboots"", stops mid print","hello,

i'm having some weird electrical issues with my taz, which may be unrelated, but here they are:

sometimes, when i'm moving the z-axis up and down for whatever reason, the printer reboots, which is more annoying than anything else.

the other thing i've had happen a couple times is that i'll start to get long prints which just stop after 10-12 hours. the heaters are still on, and i can move the axes, but not the extruder stepper. i will get it repeatedly - the only solution i've found is getting a new sd card, which seems to solve the problem for a few months and then it happens again. i think the lcd is messing up sd cards?

has anybody else had similar issues?

thanks.","kmanley57 wrote:if you are making large z moves(30mm or >) on the lcd, you can get ahead of the controller and it will reboot.

on the print stops you did not say if you are doing this from the sd card or the computer which does affect what the cause might be of either situation.

oh that's good to know about the z moves, thanks!

yeah i print from sd, otherwise my concern that the lcd is messing up my sd cards wouldn't make a lot of sense.

stripped hex nut on extruder idler block,"i have a new taz 5 that's been working well so far. today for some reason (probably too much pressure) the extruder idler block broke in two places. i managed to abs-fuse it back together, but now i can't get the bolt out - the abs around the hex nut is stripped and i've been unable to wedge it enough to be able to unscrew the bolt. does anyone have any suggestions, or can i just purchase a new extruder idler block and associated hardware?

possible to use the mini's flexystruder in the taz 6,"bit the bullet and bought a taz 6 and now trying to find a new home for my mini but i got a flexystruder for the mini that it i would like to use on the taz 6 if i can if anything just so i don't have to deal with trying to sell it separately. 

most of the mount is 3d printed so if i track down a way to switch out the mounting on it will it in general be compatible with the taz 6 as far as wiring or would that be an additional project to get it working?","well the mini uses a 2x10 connector and the taz uses a 2x8 connector, plus i think some of the wires may be in a different pattern. i know i had to make a mini to taz adapter when i started working on mini tools heads on the taz tester i use.  the thermistor pins are different pins on the mini connector i can see on my adapter(pins 15/16 - taz 17/18 - mini)."

taz 6 - hardened steel nozzle / hot-end,"hello,

i have a problem with my taz 6. i completely broke the nozzle and the thread stuck into the hotend.
the meterial of choice was cf-abs.
there is a lot out there for the taz 5 but i need to have some recommendations for the taz 6 with a single extruder v. 2.1.
lulzbot is not selling the stock extruder at the moment, so i have to make the changes by myself.
so my questions now are:
1. what hardened steel nozzle does fit into the ""single extruder v 2.1"" (http://e3d-online.com/e3d-v6/extra-nozz ... -3mmx0.6mm)? what diameter do you recommend for printing cf filled material? 0.6mm seems legit?
2. is there a hot-end kit or something like that which will fit?
3. any other general recommendations?

thanks a lot and kind regards.

carlo.","nopick wrote:i can answer one question. the e3d nozzles do fit the hexagon hotend. they are a little longer so you might need to adjust the nozzle wipe gcode if the nozzle tears up the wiper pad to quickly. i am running a v6 nozzle on my mini which has a similar nozzle wipe feature and i have not needed to adjust the wipe gcode. it works great.

there is a known issue with the hexagon nozzles fracturing. lulzbot might replace the broken part under warranty, if you wanted to go that route.

if the nozzle is longer then you may encounter issues during a probe fail sequence, where the firmware settings are used to do an additional wipe.  that wipe height is not set in the gcode."
updated electrical box for taz 5,"hey guys!

i ordered a taz 6 electrical box from it-works ( https://itworks3d.com/?v=7516fd43adaa )  and although i did have to extend a few wires and buy a few new bolts, i think it makes the print look much more elegant. i also installed a raspberry pi on the inside (the box suits come with pre drilled holes to mount a pi but if you put it inside, it won't fit right without right angled usb adapters). i also laser etched the cover panel, printed and installed the lcd bezel, interconnect housing and cover.lastly i used a cameo silhouette to make custom stickers to put a rocktopus and the text on the front of the box (it was too big to fit in my laser machine). i plan to do a few more things to it but i wanted to share what i had so far.

to this point, the project took about 12 hours.","cfipilot wrote:can you take some pictures of the inside, i would like to see how its organized inside.

thx

not sure how much it helps but here is a quick photo of the inside. i mostly followed the ohai for the taz 6 control box(https://ohai.lulzbot.com/project/taz6-c ... bly/taz-6/). the biggest difference is i added connections to the 115 v so i could add a 115 v to usb adapter and any other higher voltage extensions (like an leds). as for the cables to the printer i just removed them from the printer itself and ran them through the box. i had to extended the cb extruder 1 harness,cb extruder 2 harness, cb xz harness and the cb heat bed harness. now, i didn't extend every wire, just the ones that were short. i the mounted the old female connectors to the top of the power supply with zip tie mounts. so between the mounts and the interconnect housing, it keeps all the wires secure. 

anyway, i hope this helps!"
"improved filament tube path parts for taz 5, 6","[[ updated -- new filament guide, centered better over the idler ]]

when printing particularly brittle filaments ( carbon fiber, glass filled pla, metal filled or wood filled pla ) the filament tube often is the cause of filament breaking near the extruder.  

i have attached two stl parts to improve the filament path.  the first is an improved filament guide above the idler.  you will need to replace the m3x12 bolt provided by lulzbot with a longer one.  i used a m3x20.

https://tinkercad.com/things/cobqh6unjxg



the second is a re-designed filament idler for the wade extruder.  i seem to be having issues with thingiverse setting the license wrong... i've emailed them to ask them to match the license for the original wade parts ( gpl )

https://tinkercad.com/things/3qudmttngab



print them at 0.35mm layer height, 78% infill, line infill.   ( first layer height 0.425 mm )

i used the following speed settings:

first layer speed : 35
top/bottom speed : 40 
infill speed : 100
inner perimeter speed : 95
outer perimeter : 60
small perimeter speed : 20","i printed out the filament path to hold the tube and it is perfect.  thank you for this!

one thing to note, when the extruder retracts the filament during bed leveling, the tube does not move and the filament can sometimes not retract as well.  i simply plug the tube in after all is said and done with the leveling.

also, when i bought m3x20 bolts, they only came in a 3 pack so if anyone needs, let me know and i can put one in the mail for you!

how long can you run the taz 5 for?,i have a print that will take about 40 hours to complete. is it ok to run the printer for that long straight? is there anything i should do/take into consideration before i embark on what could be a lot of filament waste.  thanks!,"i have run a number of 2+ day prints, but when you run that long you need to make sure you prevent sudden air cooling. i keep my taz 6 in a small closet(6'x6') that i keep the door closed on and it has printed great for several months now even abs."
spare parts filament,would it work well to print spare parts for a taz 6 using ngen filament? or does it need to be abs?,"ngen should be fine for most parts. but i would recommend that you use the ngen for anything that won't be under any torsion or high temps(most of the printer don't have any parts like that except maybe parts in the extruder itself). for anything around/near or touching the nozzle or bed (the nozzle scrubber, fans nozzles on the extruder, the extruder's main body, etc.) i would recommend abs.  ngen will hold up better than standard pla but it's not as heat resistant as abs and the last thing you want is a replacement part that will bend or warp. hopefully this helps, if i am wrong i hope someone will come along and let us both know. i've been printing for awhile and i've replaced several parts on my own printer (mostly trying to upgrade things and decrease heat creep) and i've used pla for everything but the extruder housing and a fan nozzle (for cooling hexagon when i replaced the mini blower) with abs and alloy 910.

hopfully this helps."
lulzbot taz tool head v2 skips filament,"hy

recently i upgraded my taz4 to the new toolhead v2.
with my timelapse camera i discovered some strange behavior for the first and sometimes second layer.
i uploaded a video to youtube: https://youtu.be/-nhitc6y6_k

on the right upper corner you see the filament spool turning. but suddenly it stops turning but the print head is still printing. so no filament is now printed just air. but then after a few moments the tool head started to feed again the filament.
what might cause this? do you have an idea?

ps: filament is normal pla

currently it is not reproducible however i will try this with the fan. i will switch the main fan already on for the first layer and not just for the 2nd and higher.

the filament cooling fan you can control won't have any effect if you have a heat creep problem. it is the small squirrel cage fan that can become weak and cause heat creep."
hot end clogged? it is slow and sporatic to extrude,"hi all,

i'm really struggling here to get a consistent and complete print. 

lately i've just been using the bed calibration file from lulzbot to troubleshoot. i'm attaching pictures. at first it appeared that the bed might not be level- i've done a lot of work on this and am getting a consistent z- zero so i'm confident it isn't the bed being out of level. when i extrude the filament manually in cura it extrudes ok but is slow to start and seems to flow slow too. also after running the bed calibration file i am noticing that the hobbed bolt is chewing into the filament, and as you can see from the picture, the bed calibration run isn't successful. all of this seems to indicate that it might be clogged. 

so far i've tried doing a few cold pulls but with no luck.

do i actually have a clog or is it something else? and how do i solve this?

i'm using the taz 5 with the .5mm hexagon all metal hot end. with abs.

thanks!","bed is not level.

top right corner is touching the nozzle and blocking the flow, which is effectivelly a clog. and then the material can't move, and so the bolt keeps turning and grinds a divot into the  material."
z layer problems every 30mm,"i've been having serious print problems for the last few months. prints fail after 30mm in height. the filament either stops extruding or i get really poor layer adhesion or actual splits. on tall prints, the problem seems to happen around every 30mm. makes me think there's something wrong with the z axis screws, but i don't see any physical problems. it's driving me mad!

using a taz 5 flexy dually print head with pla at .3mm layer height.","the interface is a little rough on the model at the bell join point, but it's failing above that and it is manifold. if you can, i'd try extruding the center section down into the lower bell section 3-4mm to clean that up a little bit, but it should still print anyways. you could try bumping the layer temperature up a little bit (2-5 degrees) and see if that helps. you do have a little z wobble evident, which is not uncommon with a heavier x carriage. your bed leveling seems to be slightly lower on the right side, that could also be an x axis offset."

step by step assembly instructions are here for most taz versions. https://ohai.lulzbot.com/ , downloadable stl files for printing are in download.lulzbot.com. 

if the price is right, upgrading a taz 3 is very feasible and can be done in stages. the motion segment to 5 or 6 spec is priority 1, then the pei sheet and hotend. you will need to know how to install heat set inserts, crimp wires, change arduino firmware, and print parts in the first place ( or source them)

also consider the openbuilds x and y axis upgrades."
heater cartridge question,"i was thinking about purchasing a few heater block cartridges as back ups for those ""just in case"" moments. i know that the taz 5 uses a 24v 30watt heater cartridge. i found a deal on a pack of two 24v 40watt heater block cartridges for the same price as one of the 24v 30 watt units. could the 40 watt unit be used if its dimensions are the same as the original in the hexagon extruder head? i don't think it will draw more power if i continue using the same profiles i have been using, i should just be able to get higher temperatures from it if i'm not mistaken. or would i need to modify the 40 watt unit with a resistor to lower the output wattage?","nopick wrote:keep in mind the heaters don't fail often. i have thousands of printing hours across five different printers. i have never had to replace a heater cartridge. you can get a quality unit from e3d for $12 shipped. to me, it wouldn't be worth having an unknown quality part at the core of my printer. from a cost, durability and safety standpoint, i would go with a quality unit from lulzbot or e3d.

the units in question are from the same manufacturer that supplies lulzbot. i just work in an industry where i have access to parts direct from the manufacturer. they normally stock the standard 24v 30 watt version that lulzbot carries, but offered me the 2 pack 24v 40w option and was considering it for the possibility of using it at higher temps. not to aid in printing but for combing. also i am stocking up on ""just in case"" items. when we get into our new facility about our taz is in its new enclosure, it will be running at all times when the business is open so customers can see it in action. it will also be used extensively after hours for my own prototyping and product development needs. 

im upgrading to the dully v2, upgrading the belts and pulleys, and printing as many components as i can to have on hand because you never know what can happen. when our taz first arrived we had no idea it was damaged in shipping until i started to print parts taller than 40mm. one of the corner brackets had cracked and separated so the machine would wobble when the x and z axis would get above 40mm. we couldn't even see the break in the part until we moved the printer to a room that had more climate control and a more stable bench. alphobjects sent us a replacement under warranty, but the wait was excruciating."
dual extruder tool head v2 installaion issue,"hi guys,
i recently bought a dual extruder tool head, but when i followed the instruction to install it, i found some issues that make me to stop.
here is the first problem.

the tool head cannot properly align the x axis carriage.
so i have to tilt it a little bit then i can secure it.

and here is the other problem which is severer i think.

even if i turned the leveling screw to raise t1 extruder as high as possible, i still cant make the two nozzles the same height above the bed.

btw i am sure the bed is level (...at least in y axis)

has anyone encountered these issues before?","hi ,
thanks for replying.

thermal blanket,"i noticed that the aluminum plate below the glass plate gets rather warm, just from radiant heat from the glass plate heater.

is there a reason not to put an infra-red reflecting blanket on top of the aluminum plate (something like a space blanket, but rated for the temperatures it will encounter) to reflect the ir radiation back at the glass plate? this should keep the parts under the glass plate cooler, and might make a noticeable difference in the power used when printing.","insulating the bottom of the silicone heater has been on my list of things to do.  its a common common recommendation for folks who want to improve the efficiency of a 12v heater pcb/pad.  similar to your idea of reflecting infra-red back into the bed and protecting aluminum plate.  my purpose was to help maintain heat in the edge of the bed where there may not be heating elements.

i've used an insulation called reflectix in the past with good success.  its like mylar bubble-wrap... probably need 3m 468mp tape as an adhesive.  adding the insulation should heat up the bed quicker and hopefully maintain more heat on the edges of the bed.  a detracting characteristic may be the cooldown of the bed may be prolonged.


on my previous printer, a sheet of the insulation for the top of the bed helped reduce the pre-heat time (100c) from 10min to 6min.  luckily we don't have that problem with the 24v heat pad on the taz..."
sealing the electronics box air tight?,"hi there

i've been building an mdf enclosure for my taz for a while now. it's almost complete, but the issue of ventilation still remains. i have a hole on the side of the enclosure that is vented directly to the electronics box as intake for cooling. i need to exhaust that air too, obviously, but the problem then becomes that when i print with something like abs that releases styrene, the exhausted air will also be contaminated.

long story short (happy to share more details if requested or needed though!):
i'm looking to make a separate, isolated ""air passage"" for the electronics enclosure. the important thing here is that all the air that goes into the electronics box for cooling is exhausted without mixing with the air from the rest of the enclosure. is this feasible in any way? assuming that my enclosure is otherwise sealed air tight, of course. i was thinking of using something like a garden hose to exhaust the air.

obviously the electronics box will need to be insulated for this. would something like sillicone sealant do the trick perhaps?

i've made a paint drawing trying to depict what i mean.


could this work?

thanks","piercet wrote:nim wrote:
what do you mean by ""sort of"" exactly?  is there a better way to do this?

it would work with a bigger air path. the idea is sound, the garden hose idea part isn't. another option is to bring in cold air into the box, but use the positive air pressure to vent the heated air directly out the sides to help heat the enclosure. you want a bit stronger fan to try that approach, but it can work well.
nim wrote:
ahh yes, makes sense the hole must be bigger. no biggie. another challenge would be making a detachable (so the printer can be easily removed from the enclosure for upgrades/repairs etc.) system for this while still keeping it air tight. or maybe just unscrewing the electronics case when removing the machine? this is starting to seem overly complicated.
you can make a detatchable fitting setup using pvc pipe and quick disconnect fittings. there are also computer case mod ducting kits tjat would be the right size that have special fan tubes and disconnect fittings. performance-pcs.com used to carry them, they might still. you can also just do the compression seal method. make a silicone gasket to press up against the printer cold air intake and just squish the printer against it. that can backfire if the printer ever accidentally moves though so you would need to also secure the printer in place with clips or something.

excellent - thanks for the clarification.

3) some of the parts on the printer were rather coarsely printed. any reason not to use a higher resolution?
4) what is the ""mini"" directory inside the various part directories for? there is gcode in those directories, is that for lulzbot mini parts?","i printed parts in alphabetical order using abs medium profile modified to 85% fill up to the z stage, but the z stage parts were suffering layer separation.
a bit of googling suggested that the temperature of the print head used was too low. to confirm this i went looking at the gcode that was posted for the mini, and sure enough, the temperature used there was 10 degrees hotter. on top of that the fill density was only 60%.
i think the suggestion of 85% fill was a bit simplistic.

i went through all the parts, and found that not a single one used 85% fill, the densest fill was 78%, and varied all the way down to 20%
print head temperature also varied from 235 to 250 degrees c.
i made a spread sheet that picked out the primary settings for all of the parts.

i need to go through the list and see which parts i've printed are weaker than they should be. it could be all of them since they were all printed with a print head temperature of 240 degrees c.

i'm on my 4th attempt to print the z- stage parts. turning up the temperature to 250 degrees c was insufficient to get a good print. it still suffered from layer separation, but a lot less that previous attempts. this 4th attempt has turned off the cooling fans.

when it touches the 4 corners during leveling, compare the z-axis numbers for the 2 on the left side to the 2 on the right side. mine had a difference of almost 2mm! sure the script can compensate as it's printing, but it's working the z-axis the entire time to do that. i'd rather have things as close to level as possible so it doesn't have to.

so my right side was higher according to the numbers. i basically did as piercet suggests and shut the machine off, manually turn the right z-axis counter clockwise to lower it a bit. then did the bed level process again to see how close it was. i repeated that 2 more times until the right and left sides are now within .1mm of each other. much better.

first layer,im in need of help to get a better first layer. the attached photo of a pla print was originally face down on my taz5. how can i improve this print as this is the side i need to look good.,"i thought it was overextrusion as well at first, but not really anymore.  i have previously dialed down from 205 deg c to 190 deg c, to help with that.   and i did previously increase the retraction from 1 mm to 5 mm and from 10 mm/sec to 35 mm/sec.    

the interesting thing that makes me think its not a retraction issue is that the rib is always for the entire length.   its not like a variable length dribble.   and watching the test part print, it is the final final pass it makes.   its like it finishes the layer, then does one more pass, directly on top of plastic already laid for that layer.    the pictures below show the time sequence.   the 2nd picture shows that the ""slit"" of not yet laid plastic is the last area to be filled in.   it is being filled diagonally from left to right.   the final pass is on the right of the slit, and that is where the pronounced bump / rib is deposited.    on more complex parts, this happens numerous times when the slicer has decided to go fill a region that was previously left empty.

could it be a cura g-code generation issue?   or a positioning issue in the xy axes where it's not locating the nozzle in xy space exactly correctly and depositing in the wrong location?   or play/slop in the xy axes causing the same?   i don't detect any play in the x or y axes linearly (along their travel directions), but the y axis does seem to have some play rotationally, i mean that i can twist the bed and feel some play/give in the y-axis bushings.   however i'm not familiar enough to know whether that is the same play that has always been there or if this has developed over the past year of use.

difference between 3mm and 1.75mm hexagon?,"hi all:

stupid question.  what are the differences between the 3mm and 1.75mm hexagon hotend?  i assume the heatblock is the same, and so is the heatsink?  is it just the heat break?

thanks in advance!","there are potentially 2 to 3 differences, depending on which model you are looking at. the first difference is the size of the plastic melt chamger area in the nozzle tip itself. the 3.0mm one is bigger. the second difference is that the 1.75mm hexagon barrel itself has a narrower 1.75mm insert threaded into the top to narrow the fillament path. the third potential difference is that many of the 1.75mm hexagons are the ""nn-ao"" eddition, and will have a shorter heater block."
defaut e-step in cura and on lulzbot,"so i followed the instructions when swapping to the flexystruder on my taz 6 a few days ago.  i wrote the number down on the back of the head and entered that into cura when told in the directions for the e-step piece.  today, i switched back to the standard/default head and now i can't remember what the e-step number was prior.  i think it was 0 so i entered that and it seems to be printing well.  now, if i go into the lcd of the taz itself, it has a number of 866 there for the e-step.  should i put that in cura instead?  or leave it how i have it at 0?  will the machine settings override cura?  i feel like i made such a rookie mistake!

thanks for the help!","0 in cura box = use machine/firmware e steps

number on flexy in cura box = use that number instead.

so if using the flexy you enter the number on the back of it in the box in cura. if you re-install the original you enter 0 in the same box so that it uses the number in the firmware that matches the e steps for the original extruder."
favorite dual cooling fan?,"hi gang,
have had my taz 5 a couple of weeks and can already see the advantage of having dual print cooling. i've heard there's a couple of options to print. would appreciate input on favorite duct/ducts? i'm assuming i can get the actual fans on lulzbot or amazon? am i to new to be doing this, i'm not all that familiar with things like fan speeds yet, but have noticed a kind of lopsided print, slight, from one side being cooled more readily. thanks","i used all of the taz 6 stuff, had to take a chunk out of my fan with some side cutters to clear the z bed screw, but ive probably got 1000+ hours on it since doing that easy."
post cleaning/prep of pei bed on taz 6,"gents and ladies,

was curious.  after printing with t-glase or ninjaflex, or any material that requires putting down glue stick for the print, what is the proper cleanup procedure on a taz 6 pei glass?  is it safe to scrape the residue and then do final cleanup or do not scrape the bed at all?  wasn't sure if the glass is treated or simply glass and whether it was ok or not to scrape it clean with a putty knife.

thanks, rich","hello,

i recommend using warm water with a soft cloth to clean glue off the pei."
taz 5 retraction,"i have a taz 5, and in spite of every setting we have tried, when it comes to the point where it must retract a little, it retracts so much that it looses the grip on the filament.

the following have been done so far:

i have narrowed down the problem to one of retracting the filament too far, and then not being able to advance the filament and/or the tension between the idler wheel and the hobbed bolt, but nothing seems to help.

1. disabled retraction in the cura software, including basic tab, advanced tab, expert settings.
2. cleaned the hobbed bolt, and the rest of the gearing ? mechanism.
3. blew out all debris with compressed air, and vacuumed out all debris.
4. adjusted the tension between the idler wheel and the hobbed bolt from virtually no tension at all to filament grinding and every tension in between.
5. adjusted all settings that might have something to do with this, including move speed, fill %, bed temperature, hot end temperature, every retraction setting i could find, including ""don't retract for xmm"". i set this to 100mm, and it still retracts.

help!

thank you.","nopick wrote:you might check your hotend fan. make sure it is clear of debris and spinning. you should hear a whine from that fan when the printer is running. i have had a couple of these fans partially fail and cause heat creep related filament swell in the cold section of the hot end while printing with pla. if you are printing pla, you might be experiencing something similar.

thanks nopick. i have gone over the hardware in detail, the fan was and is working fine."
simple filament runout sensor,"i designed a simple microswitch based filament runout sensor here http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1698397. i appreciate lulzbot adding the pause function to cura, but i really get tired of waiting for the spool to run out.  sebastian's version of marlin supports filament runout.","thanks for fixing the url.

here is some additional info on  how to wire up the sensor to the taz5.  hopefully it will save somebody else some time.  as a software base i used the version found here: viewtopic.php?f=18&t=4464&p=26568#p26568.  for the physical wiring, you need to connect the switch to the rambo board. 



 i wired it such that the switch is open when there is filament present and closed when there is no filament.  i wired it to pin 24 (circled in red in the circuit board image).  



the switch is wired to the two rightmost pins of the x-max header.  pin 24 is used for the x-max limit switch or for servo2 (starting from 0).  so if you use either of those, you will have to find a different pin.  

you need to make changes in pins_rambo.h,  configuration.h, and optionally in marlin_main.cpp.  in pins_rambo.h you need to define the filrunout_pin.  i added the line after the fan pin definitions as follows: code: select all#define fan1_pin           6  //fan1 --- extruer0 fan
#define fan2_pin           2  //fan2 --- case fan
#define filrunout_pin 	  24i also set the x_max_pin to -1, but i don't know if that is really needed:code: select all#define x_max_pin -1

in configuration.h you need to enable the function and also set the sensor to uninverted. code: select all//===========================================================================
//========================= filament runout sensor ==========================
//===========================================================================
#define filament_runout_sensor // uncomment for defining a filament runout sensor such as a mechanical or opto endstop to check the existence of filament
                                 // in ramps uses servo pin 2. can be changed in pins file. for other boards pin definition should be made.
                                 // it is assumed that when logic high = filament available
                                 //                    when logic  low = filament ran out
#if enabled(filament_runout_sensor)
  const bool fil_runout_inverting = false;  // should be uncommented and true or false should assigned
  #define endstoppullup_fil_runout // uncomment to use internal pullup for filament runout pins if the sensor is defined.
  #define filament_runout_script ""m600""
#endif

this works great, but for some reason marlin only enables the function when the print is run from the sd card.  i wanted it to also occur when i ran from cura.  so you need to make the following change in marlin_main.cpp.  change the line (somewhere around line 7258) from 
code: select all  #if has_filrunout
    if (is_sd_printing && !(read(filrunout_pin) ^ fil_runout_inverting))
      filrunout();
  #endif
 to:
code: select all  #if has_filrunout
//    if (is_sd_printing && !(read(filrunout_pin) ^ fil_runout_inverting))
    if (!(read(filrunout_pin) ^ fil_runout_inverting))
      filrunout();
  #endif
  there may a good reason why it was only enabled when printing from a sd card, but i didn't know what it was and it checks that there is a lcd panel.  anyway, it works when running from cura, but i would appreciate knowing why it was disabled.

good luck!"
flexystruder v1 with taz 5,"hello, 

i own a taz 4 but recently upgraded to the taz 5 single extruder head v2. with all of the re-configuring that i had to do for this, i'm now realizing that i probably won't be able to use my old flexystruder v1 with this. can someone confirm? if so is there a way to re-configure the old flexystruder to upgrade it? hope i don't have an obsolete part sitting here now..  

thanks, 
emily","the 'e steps' is the number of steps the motor has to perform to pull a set amount of filament in to the hot-end. this is used to determine the amount of filament/steps needed to extrude a solid bead for any printing head movement by the slicing program. it is based on the distance the hobbed bolt surface travels in one rotation, which usually is different between each bolt. thus can be different for the two extruder heads.

   the re-flash is needed to control the amount and rate of power sent into the heat element of the hot end. the buda uses a power resistor which will burn out of it is supplied the same amount of power/rate the hexagon heat element can handle. so if you forget to flash back to the taz4 code it will burn out the buda heating resistor during heating.

the unused blower wires can be ignored since they have no problem with connecting to nothing on the extruder.

but you may need an adapter depending on which hexagon connector you have, as the v1 flexy has the 4 individual connectors and some versions of hexagons have them combined into one 2x8 connector."
problem with extruding filament in unsupported areas,"the elephant's legs move so there is a gap between the body and the leg.  this area cannot be scaffolded.  on all four legs the same problem occurred when the printer would attempt to lay filament in areas that had no support beneath.  in one case it created a glob of loosely connected filament that it began to drag around.  i paused the print and manually move it out of the way with tweezers.  some photos of what happened are attached.


















my question is:  what is the remedy to this problem?

taz 6, beginner mode, ngen, 230/85","to kmanley57's point, try more cooling via the fan or lower your extrusion temp slightly.  the lower extrusion temps and increased cooling should ""lock"" your overhangs in place.  keep in mind to stay within the filament manufacturers suggest temperature range.  check thingiverse for some overhang test prints... there are a ton of them.

if you're using cura, the ""tweak on z"" plugin should allow you to adjust the fan temp.  you'll probably want to keep your current settings in tack for the iniitial layers to ensure adhesion to the print bed.

hope that helps!"
"taz 6 : better filament path, prevent filament snapping","i have been experimenting with changing the filament path of my taz 6.  i've been getting snapped filaments from the amount of torque and force brittle filaments like laybrick, laywood, polywood get when they go through the filament tube into the idler.

this is the best solution i have found so far -- mount the filament reel on top of the machine, not the side.  this eliminates the need for a filament guide tube, and the friction that the tube has.   ( same problem delta printers have with bowden tubes ) 

these filament holders are easy to print, use standard 3/4"" pvc pipe has the spool holder, and so the job very well.  so far, they have fit all the spools i have purchased from lulzbot, makergeeks, hatchbox, and others.   when you put a pvc tube in them, they support themselves, but i chose to ziptie mine to the machine and 3d print the tube.



http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1424791

","i had a similar problem with my taz 5 filament breakage but for a different reason. i was printing with matterhackers pla and was having frequent breaks, particularly near the end of the spool. initially i thought that there was  problem with the filament, and contacted matterhackers, who very nicely sent me 2 spools of pla gratis. turns out the problem was temperature. it must be warm where matterhackers lives, but in december-january here in new england it gets cooold, particularly in our house, where the daytime temps are in the low 60's, and nighttime at 55 or so. (my wife says we don""t heat the place!) what was happening was that as the filament cooled, it would break, sometime at several locations in the feed tube. so i made a mount similar to yours, which was an improvement, but the filament 
still broke if we were away and the house temps were set in the low 50's. the solution was to mount a small floodlight (25 watts or so) directed horizontally at the filament spool centerline about 6"" to the left of the single spool while printing. (i haven't graduated to dual filaments yet.) i haven't had a break since, and now that it is summer i don't need to use it.

taz6 dual extruder v2 extrudes a bunch of excess filament before starting print,"i have been running my taz6 for a couple of months and just put on the dual extruder head v2 today. i'm printing out the calibration squares, and having a couple of strange issues.

(1) it was retracting far too much. at one point, one of the extruders retracted so much that it expelled the filament out the top and i had to reload it. i managed to fix this issue by going into cura and changing retraction > dual extrusion switch amount from 30mm to 10mm. i don't know why this was set so high initially?!? i certainly didn't change it. i mention this just in case it is related to my current problem:

(2) right after auto-leveling and just before beginning the print, it spits out a bunch of junk filament. first, the primary (t0) tool head extrudes a bunch of filament. then the secondary (t1) tool head extrudes a bunch of filament. by a bunch, i mean like on the order of 60-80mm - almost enough to form a life-size hershey's kiss abs booger. if i pause the print and remove this, it completes the print ok. 

any advice on booger prevention?","here is the code from start2.gcode that follows the wipe process:
code: select allg1 z10                       ; raise extruder

i am new to gcode, so is it the line code: select allg1 e0 f100  that causes the problem? does this indicate extrusion of 100mm of filament? i am unsure as how to modify it."
taz 4 stopping mid-print...sometimes,"i have a taz 4 and suddenly it is stopping mid-print. one thing that has me wondering is that the fan in the rambo enclosure is not on when the machine is running. is that fan controlled or is it on all the time, i never noticed before. thanks.","depending on which firmware you are running, it should kick in automatically at the start of print. it may not be running at idle. if the taz is stopping mid print that can be heat, or that can be usb or processor overhead on the host computer. mine will sometimes do that as well on a very complex model driven from the pc. try the same model from the sd card and see if the issue persists. if its only occuring on the sd card with no computer attached, you may have an overheating issue."
debris appears in extruded filament,"dark debris appears intermittently in extruded filament.  my uneducated guess is that filament that gets dragged around or contaminants from the cleaning track get on the hot tip and it flakes off occasionally into the extruded filament.  the hot tip is dark around cone of nozzle.  an image of what is happening is included.

on taz 6, ngen, 230/85 beginner mode.

my question is:  how do i not have this happen?","try bringing your nozzle close to extrusion temp and clean it with a scotchbrite non-scratching scrub pad. remove everything. i just pinch the nozzle with the scotchbrite and twist.

then make sure your wipe pad is clean so the nozzle won't pick up any debris while cleaning itself. i pick out little plastic pieces with tweezers and an exacto knife after each print. try not to rip the pad up when prying away stuff as you don't want the hard pad to become a fuzz ball.

then print.

also when changing filaments, be sure to extrude/purge the old stuff out completely. there could be little pieces of burnt leftovers in the nozzle, so really try to clear everything out and extrude like 8"" of the new filament until it's pure. i think this is especially important when changing the type of filament you are using and not just the color."
"extruder decision advice for library - flexidually, dual extruder","hi,
i am looking for advice. i am trying to make a good decision for my patrons. 3d printing at my library is new. i did my best to read as many post related to my questions as possible.  here is where i am at.  i am purchasing accessories for a public library users, so there will be a range of printing needs.   we have a taz 6 and a printrbot play.   we have the grant money now and won't really have it for sure in subsequent years.  basically our budget on going will be for basic maintenance and filament (which depends on use). 

i am looking to definitely provide dual extrusion and also flexy filament options. i had been prepared to fork up the money out of grant money to buy the dual extruder, flexydually, and flexy - about $1,300.  however, after reading some posts here i see that there are people that are printing their own extruder heads or attaching a single extruder to the flexydually (swapping out the flexy extruder) i am unsure what is the best approach.  also, i believe i read that a best practice is - if you want to offer different types of filaments you may want to have a dedicated extruder for each - not just a nozzle?  we have only printed with pla and ngen so far, i am not sure how abs will print, we do not have an enclosure. so if printing parts with abs is necessary that may matter.

so my question is should i --
a) just buy all three - you're over thinking it, this opportunity won't happen again. 
b) buy just the dual extruder and single flexy (with the idea i can put the flexy on the dual for a dual flex and non-flex extruder) - spend the rest on filament.
c) buy just the flexydually and single flexy (with the idea i can put the single non-flex extruder on the flexydually to make a dual non-flex extruder) - aside: can the flexi extruder from the flexidually become a single flexy? 
d) find the money - just buy all three and add another single extruder for ""exotic"" or metal filaments.
e) if i were to buy just b or just c - would you buy a second single extruder for ""exotic"" or metal filaments.

thanks for you collective wisdom and advice,

sarah","i'm no expert, in fact, i've really just started in the process of 3d printing a month back with a taz 6. but i have an engineering background, so it may be easier for me than others.

however, let me give you my take on things.

1st of all, the taz 6 supposedly can take 1.75mm filament (though not supported) and works well. i mention this as there are more choices in this size, and may be cheaper.

2nd, make sure you check amazon prices, newegg prices as well as lulzbot and matterhackers for filament and tool heads. amazon prices vary often, so check often. the dual head is typically about 6% off at amazon. filament prices vary a lot (as well as quality) so check all these sites. if there is a microcenter near you, they carry some of these things, and occasionally (read rarely) they have some of these things that they do carry on sale in store.

dual extruder and fleydually. i have been experimenting with the start, start2, end and end2 gcode. the initialization files that come with lulzbot edition of cura for the dual heads seem to be limited for types, e.g. pla-pla. in fact, finding that page that has some configuration files is difficult on the lulzbot web pages. however, if set up correctly (and i don't know if their cura or the new version of cura), you can use a either dual extrusion head as if it was a single head (so you can have both filaments loaded as choices). simplify3d may well be worth it, and may be better at this as it comes. it is considered the best slicer, and i have yet to use it. but simplify3d may also be cheaper for an educational facility such as a library. same thing may also be for solidworks or other paid cad or support software.

so, in my opinion the single head that came with the taz 6, a dual extruder and a flexydually may be all you need for the greatest flexibility with the lowest cost. i would probably leave the dual extruder as the primary tool head though.

the tool head cable pins can be easily damaged if not inserted carefully when changing tool heads, so i recommend changing heads only when absolutely necessary, and limiting those that can. i changed the tool head screw that holds it on (an m3 x 10mm screw) to knurled knob screw, which allows me to change the head without a tool. i have a lot of spares of these, and if you wanted one, pm me, and i could mail it to you.

usage by many people issues - i have found if you load the wrong firmware (which you should do when changing heads, particularly switching between dual and single) it will do bad things in the homing process (noisy things like pressing the bed down near the homing switch) which can't be good. wrong configuration files can mess up heads and the bed. bad removal techniques will destroy your pei bed. so what can you do? 1st of all create a checklist for changing heads so users can always follow the sequence. teach users how to prepare the bed (e.g. tape, glue, etc) if needed, how to remove the objects from the bed, and how to insert and remove filaments from the tool head. have people be careful of the tool head extruder heat (up to 300 degrees c) and the bed heat as well when turned up to high temperatures. you don't want people to get burned! and tool usage and safety (e.g to remove objects) is paramount.

learn and teach how to align the z axis when it goes slightly off on one side or the other.

consider using octoprint (or octopi) to run the actual gcode, so that you don't tie up a full computer while printing, plus you can stream video so patrons can watch their print remotely. you can use the mattertouch product, but cost will be higher.

don't use abs unless you really, really need to. the smell may be bad for a library environment unless you can enclose it and vent it out. nylon may also require venting.

use the least damaging filaments (non-specialty) in typical usage (ngen, pla, xt, petg) to preserve your tool heads. i believe the nozzle wear is the primary issue, and while can be changed, is not a particularly easy thing to do.

stick to a minimum of colors, as they can be painted with various degrees of success depending on type. i would stick mostly to white or a light gray.

let me just repeat, i am far from an expert at this point and others may be much more qualified to talk on the subject, but i think all my points above are correct, particularly for a shared environment.

good luck."
z-axis trouble?,"i've taken some pictures of a problem i'm having on one of four (4) taz 5 printers we use.  it appears that the something is wrong with the z-axis as the parts looked very elongated.  i've printed an individual part out just fine.  the pictures show one of thirty parts that were printed all at once on the printer.  this part has been printed many, many times successfully on this printer and the other three.  

from looking at the pictures can anyone suggest a likely area to investigate to resolve this issue?","thank you for your help.  my issue was a heat problem as you suggested but it was due to the enclosure temperature being too high such that benefit of the heat sink was not realized (my theory anyhow).  solution was to simply open the enclosure door during printing and let the temperature remain relatively low and also not be able to build up high enough to cause precise loss of the z axis control.

thanks for your prompt reply and for helping us zero in on the area to look at!"
y_idler_mount_v4.0.fcstd file not the same part as on my taz 6,"i have been building all of the parts used on the taz 6 to get some experience with the taz 6 printer, and to have spare parts on hand.

i found the hard way that x_carriage_guide_v2.stl has the part upside down but x_carriage_guide_v2-x4.stl has 4 parts right side up.

but the biggest problem i have run into is that the y_idler_mount_v4.0.fcstd is not the same part as the one that is on my taz 6.
the one that i printed has the cylindrical cutout in the base extending under the smaller of the shaft supports. this is a structure that can not be properly built without support material since there is a part of this bearing support that hangs down.
the one that is on my machine does not have the cylindrical cut out extending under the shaft support. on this one, the base is solid, and the shaft support is not hanging in air.
i verified that the one i built is the same as what it looks like in freecad, so the design file is wrong.

could someone please direct me to the correct design file?
thanks.

taz 6 bed leveling - auto vs manual,"as i was going through the taz 6 auto bed leveling, the firmware returned this data

< bed x: -9.00 y: -9.00 z: 1.469375
< bed x: 288.00 y: -9.00 z: 1.519375
< bed x: 288.00 y: 289.00 z: 0.850625
< bed x: -9.00 y: 289.00 z: 1.685000
< eqn coefficients: a: -0.001320 b: -0.000760 d: 1.671742
< planenormal x: 0.001320 y: 0.000760 z: 1.000000

based on the 4 ""z-axis"" values in the above, it looks like the measurement seems to be in 1/8 of a .001 millimeter jumps, in other words, accuracy of .000125 mm. the values vary as much as .83 mm from each other.

so i was wondering whether leveling the bed on the taz 6 manually made any sense.
1. what is considered a good bed leveling accuracy for a manual bed leveling system?
2. is the taz 6 capable of being manually leveled? if it could, i suspect it would either just be a little more or less tight on the appropriate leveling washer, or else some small ""shims"" in that corner that needed it. perhaps the metal plate holder for the bed should have some metal angle brackets or similar on it to keep it from flexing (which it clearly does).
3. would it produce a better print than just doing an auto-leveling?","there is no mechanism on the taz 6 to level the bed. the corners are fixed in alignment. that being said the plate is usually pretty flat, and the corner thickness is usually pretty consistant, so it should be pretty flat already. you could convert a 6 back to manual leveling if you built it some retrofit corners and made a new motor mount with z alignment target and endstop, but that would be a lot of work."
taz 6 1st layer slightly too thick.,"i have been having an issue with narrow protrusions of parts not sticking very well. i have noticed that the fill on these protrusions is not making contact with the table (round cross section, no flat spot to show contact). 
i have increased the 1st layer line width to 135%, and this has helped, but the thin protrusions still show significantly less contact than the broad regions on the 1st layer.
i had printed a part with a brim, and decided to measure the 1st layer height.
the 1st layer is set to 0.425mm, but the brim measured 0.4826mm.
is there a way to adjust the calibration?","what's the z measurement on a calibration cube?  that's probably a better gauge of the z accuracy.  or design your own calibration print for fitment accuracy (ie, solid cylinder, and hollow cylinder). here's one from thingiverse.

personally, i think .05mm isn't enough to worry about.  it could be many things... overextrusion, probe disc or nozzle machining tolerance, filament color (additives in certain colors can cause dimensinal inaccuracies.), caliper accuracy... 

here are a few options you can try increase accuracy:
- reduce flow rate by 2 - 5%.  this will cure the possible overextrusion.  ultimately, double check your e-step calibration (mark filament 120mm above idler, extrude 100mm, measure distance to mark... if not 20mm, calculate new e-step found in link above).
- adjust z-offset through the lcd panel.
- there's also a gcode command to offset the z axes... it might be m206 z###.  my machine is in the middle of a print, but a m501 should show the current setting.  make sure to issue a m500 to store the new m206 value."
trouble all of a sudden,"hello all,

ok, so i've been printing stuff since i got my taz 5 on thursday and this (see images) is the first real issue i've had since some initial problems mostly because of my ignorance.

the funny thing is that this is the second time for this some problem. at first i thought maybe i'm having extruder issues. so i took off the extruder and did some checking ala mhackney's reply in this post:
viewtopic.php?f=7&t=1839
no problems; in fact everything inside the extruder and hotend looked really good. no sharp edges or anything.

the funny thing is that the second time this happened, i realized that not only was it happening at the exact same location as the first time, but (again see image) repetier-host is showing red in the same area as the ""fail"". that can't be a coincidence. right? there must be something that repetier-host is trying to tell me.

please advise. thanks!","@muggs 
lets run down the list (mine was doing this for 3 weeks - see previous posts ) 

*level the damn bed xd- i do it extruder cold w/ nothing sticking out of nozzle but bed warmed up for at least a few minutes @ 70 to let it settle. do your paper leveling in all the corners, get a bit of drag on the paper and try to make it the same amount at all the points you check. we'll fine tune this later but it should at least get the bed ""level""

clean the tip if the extrusion doesn't fall out straight or at least close (mine would immediately grab the side and ball up- heat it up to around +5-10 of what the filament manufacturer recommends, brace the head with 1 hand and manually push some clean filament through. let the head cool to about 60 or so and start heating it again while pulling back through the top. it should stretch armstrong it's way out, do that a few times until filament extrudes strait.

clean the hobbed bolt with that little pick and brush and clean it well.

caliper up and check that filament, get an average on the x plane and y plane on a few different distances and use the average in the slicer your using.

set the tension on the pulley - mines about 8mm from the plastic to the metal thumbscrew (inside measurement with filament inside)

*also, with the filament installed and alllll the way to the hotend, loosen the two allen heads on the bottom (that sandwich that aluminum plate between the plastic above and below) and re-tighten to let the slop sort of center the filament. this made lining up the filament when i had to re-insert it much easier w/ less resistance. 

now let's extrude something. software raise your z-axis until its 40 or so mm high to give you some space. set your calipers to 100mm and mark on the filament from a known position to 100mm (i use that little plastic flat above the hobbed bolt). now extrude 100mm at 40 or 50mm/m and the mark should line up w/ the thing you measured from. if not, on the taz go into click control click motion click and all the way 2nd from the bottom (not e1) esteps/mm. i think less will bring the line up and more will bring it down (when you go to try extruding again)...or the opposite i don't remember. goal being line lining up w/ point from where you measured.

use the medium config files from lulzbot for the tests in whatever slicer you like, it gives good speed parameters, or fine if you are daring, *and i'm using the upper end of what the recommended temperature is from the manufacturer (slic3r is better imho until cura gets some more options, also for some reason cura does some weird stuff with my first layer height so i try to avoid it).

start a print with skirt enabled, do a few loops and stop the print. i kind of blow on the loop to harden it a bit and pull it up. grab those calipers again and check if the layer height is what you set first layer height to, if not,(knowing that the bed is level) adjust that z- axis screw bit by bit accordingly and repeat until it matches.

that's a good place to start and give whoever is reading you posts a good understanding of what you have and haven't tried or i am horribly mistaken and should remove this post but mines been working like a champion the last few days.

then there's seasoning of the tip, but i don't want to recommend that if there's some terrible reason not to do it/voiding any warranties (it was my last ditch effort, but something might have changed when i was switching nozzles around[also apparently frowned upon lol]) but i will if everything else in this post fails to help. this will involve a more thorough cleaning tutorial, but also involve removing that tip >.<, probably re-taping the stainless throat as well (i bodged my sealant up and started having pla leak out the top)

ps- what is your extrusion width and/or %/ layer height set to it looks super thick to me...

*pss- i'm going to keep remembering things and editing this post xd"
is secondary extruder wire harness same for dual & flexydually?,"is the secondary extruder wire harness the same for the dual extruder v2 and flexydually v2 tool head?

if so, can the tool head without all the duplicate items be purchased (in order to save some money) assuming you already had one of them?","yes. the only possible difference would be that the newer ones may or may not have the ground wire necessary for auto leveling, which could be added. you can see what plugs in where here: https://ohai.lulzbot.com/"
differing machine speeds,"i have 2 taz 5's.  one bought about a year ago and one bought about a month ago.  both are running identical firmware, the cura settings are the same, and the parameters i read from the lcd for the motion control are the same (esteps are slighty different).  they have identical hw mods (a servo mounted z-probe and a filament runout sensor).  but they run at different speeds.  the newer taz completes a 25 point leveling sequence in 85 seconds.  the older taz requires about 160 seconds to do the same thing.  i though that the microstepping might be different, but then i would expect one machine would produce half height objects and it doesn't.  it's  just slower.

any idea what could be going on?","are the power supplies identical? if the motors have higher available voltage, they might maybe move faster through the same operations? otherwise i can't think of anything other than the firmware is not identical, or the leveling code is not identical. if the pulleys were different size with identical firmware you would get different size parts. same with different motor stepping. the rambo boards are identical, there are no stepping jumpers.

are they being ran from the sd card or two different computers? if its different computers is the baud rate different by any chance?"
about over the pei sheets,"so i think i'm pei jinxed.....i've ripped 2 sheets in 2 months while trying to remove projects.  i'm not using anything sharp, it's actually a painters spatula i got at hobby lobby.  so i'm wondering, can i just get a cut piece of glass and clip it to the heated bed? (taz 5)  what thickness glass is best or does anyone have a better suggestion?  it's just frustrating as i'm on my second sheet and there are 2 small rips in it already.  at $50 a sheet, it's ridiculous.  maybe i need to start using more pla and less abs, lol.

thanks in advance for any help/suggestions!","pei is great but getting the z axis height right is crucial. i tell people you just want the filament to kiss the pei and not press it into it. also your bed must (big must) be absolutely level.

i get my pei from zoro tools and i am using 0.125"" lasts me a little over a year before i end up gouging it.

also get yourself one of these little painters knifes (spatula) this is the absolute best removal tool i have used (and i tried a lot of them). the end is very thin so it easily gets under parts yet it's very strong an flexible. also since the end is flat and horizontal to the handle there is very little chance of taking a chunk out of the bed and it's just easy to use. you can find them at art supply stores in many shapes but the one in the photo is my favorite.

run extruder to edge of aluminum,"hi,
so i have a taz 5 and some cheap wire brushes i got at hf.  i have stuck one to the upper left corner on the y axis of my machine to use as a wiper.  i know the bed can move to make the extruder wipe against the brush manually but the firmware or something in the taz wont allow it.  does anyone know where i would have to make this change to allow this process to be scripted through g code?","brent.i wrote:do not use a wire brush. this can cause a short in your hot end, and destroy your rambo board. i repeat, do not use a wire brush.

the wiping sequence is contained in the start gcode. if you would like to incorporate it you can find it in any of our taz 6 profiles found here: https://www.lulzbot.com/taz-6-cura-profiles

we hope this helps!

i second this in all caps do not use the wire brush!!!!!!"
no dual extruder x-axis right side stop switch?,"i have a taz 6 (taz 4 and taz 5 may be a bit different). on my dual extruder v2 i just noticed there is no x-axis right-side stop switch. the purple wires for it in the single extruder v2 as well as the switch are not there in the dual extruder. 

so is there a reason for not having it as a safety? if the problem is a physical space problem (although it doesn't look like one), i might either try to parallel the wires from the controller and place the switch on the stationary right side, or put a magnetic (reed) switch on the dual head and wire the pins in  there.

on the other hand, if the firmware for the dual extruder doesn't use it (lack of memory space?), maybe it needs to be coded in there.

any comments?","miracj wrote:second, does the firmware support the x maximum limit switch, and if not, is there a reason (like lack of code space)?

based upon my testing of the single extruder v2 switch and examination of the rambo board schematic, i can tell you that the sensor pin is held at ground (switch is normally closed) until when the endstop is hit at which switch opens. 

the signal is internally pulled up on the rambo board, so this means the default read value for the sensor is 0 until it hits the endstop at which point it is a 1 on the single extruder.

however, on the dual extruder, the read value is always a 1, so if it would be used as a endstop signal, it would always be read that way. that implies that the firmware for dual extruder must ignore this signal. the only possibility of potential use this way is that the firmware reads the initial value after a home, and if 0, uses the sensor, otherwise it ignores it. but this seemed like an odd way. i would have expected the switch to close when it hits the endstop, so that the default was the other way.

so i tested the dual extruder firmware and hooked a normally-open switch to the x endstop limit sensing wires. sure enough, it moved to the right under a gcode command (g1 x250) until i closed the switch. this indicates that the firmware's sensing is opposite on the dual extruder from the single extruder (very strange, and a bit unexpected). 

the dual extruder, imho, is the correct way to do it. unless you either 
1. wanted a way to detect a dual extruder from a single extruder (which may be the case, but i have not seen the homing take it into account this readable difference, which it could - the homing misses the home switch when using dual extruder with a single extruder firmware), or
2. have a fail-safe mode that if the sensor wire breaks (but this would not allow for an extruder that did not have an end-stop switch, or at least jumpered sensor wire in the extruder connecting wire). 

so, the takeaway is
1. the x axis right endstop limit switch is supported in the firmware for the dual extruder v2 (and also for the flexydually v2)
2. an end stop switch should be normally open until it hits the right side for the dual extruder v2 (and also for the flexydually v2)
3. the switch can be hooked up to the same pins as the switch of the single extruder v2 (2 purple wires on mine)

next, the question is what parts are best to use for the 2 female i/o pins needed on the dual extruder connector? probably like this 
 female crimp pins for 0.1"" housings https://www.amazon.com/female-crimp-pin ... b019nj8v54
or maybe just using 2 wires removed from a pre-made cable like this and remove the female pins from the header
https://www.amazon.com/sunkee-conductor ... b00aswyx0s

finally a holder for a switch on the dual extruder could be made between the screw on the metal plate and the screws of the right-side extruder fan where the single extruder's x axis stop switch makes contact. the 2 fan screws on the right side are m3 x 20mm, and can be additional 10mm maximum longer for a switch holder. the screw on the metal plate towards the back is an m3 x 25mm screw and can be an additional 25mm longer for the switch holder."
help with elephant's foot,"trying to print a lego minifig head (smaller footprint than the bulk of the print) and it has a tendency to blow out the base and sink since the surface area is small. i've tried extra infill support and reducing the bed temp a couple hours into the print. is there another way i could prevent it aside from the obvious split it in two?

here's what they look like (yes, lots of trial prints and wasted filament, bear with me!):











from left to right: 1) perfect print (reduced bed temp two hours in), 2) 110c throughout print, 3) 110c throughout print (although the model was scaled down and material deleted for the cutaway - it merely caused the model to lean towards the heavier non cutaway section), 4) reduced temp to 75c two hours in (the smaller model caused the print to go quicker than the 'perfect' one and hence the temperature reduction was too late - the latent heat in the model was enough to distort the base).","the bed is level, don't think that's the issue, neither is the extrusion. i will try the chamfer, but pretty much if i don't turn off or reduce the bed's temperatures, the built up heat causes the upper layers to sink into the due to it's mass, the pressure is increasing the heat within the part. i've had no issues if the base is the widest or equal to the widest portion of a part, oh well, more experimentation.

i think the base needs directed cooling to solidify it after it gets pass the increase in diameter for the face tbh.

the extrusion width is set at 125%, i'll dial it down to 115-120% and see what the result is."
cleaning,"greetings

i have inherited a lulzbot taz and the last thing printed on it was ninjiflex. i was told they properly prepared the printer bed with the glue stick that came with the printer.

i was told by the former teacher that to clean the print bed use isopropyl alcohol. this doesn't really seem to remove all the residue. they printed bracelets and you can still see the outline of them and feel ""gunk"" on the print bed.

also below the print bed, between the heating element and the clear top, where one doesn't have access too, there is splotchy yellowish stuff. is this normal? its nothing that can be access, but it seems very odd.

any guidance would be greatly appreciated.","artteachertim wrote:greetings

i personally use water if it is the purple glue stick. but i use 93% iso alcohol to clean with, so not much water in it to take the water soluble glue off with.

abs prints no longer sticking to pei (taz5),"had an issue with a large abs print on the taz5 where the corners would lift up even after adding brims to the edge of the plate and a thicker base layer so i decided to try some glue stick. bad idea, terrible (even worse adhesion), so i cleaned it off with water and iso-alcohol. 

first test print after getting rid of the glue stick - minimal adhesion, so little in fact that even with a brim i could easily remove the print even when the bed is at operating temps (110c). it quite literally slide off with the tiniest of persuasion. tried cleaning the bed again (no it was not my z-height), no go again. tried mr. clean eraser, no dice. about to sand it with some 2000 grit wet/dry.

any other things i could try? the printer has literally only been used for a month. i don't want to have to resort to using abs juice because the pei wasn't like this before the glue stick.","piercet wrote:check that your pei sheet doesn't have large bubbles in it. also check the actual temperature of the bed with an infrared point and shoot thermometer to make sure you don't have a failing thermistor or heated bed that is heating much lower than it thinks it is. also if you can post an image of the bottom of the part you were trying so we can check the adhesion

first one is from before the gluestick shenanigans, the second is the part that failed (corners lifted). third is after cleaning off the gluestick (corners failed again) and fourth is with a 2mm base layer.





















the last attempt seems like it worked (no lifting/warping!) but it wasn't stuck to the bed and the center looks like it was about to cup. will do the 800 grit (lightly!)."
taz 6 - problem with z axis --- help,"ill try to explain this the best i can:

i bought a taz6 around a month ago.

everything was perfect. until today, right after printing an object. the z axis started to misbehave.

the extruder unit cannot go up or down. the z axis motors do not move smoothly. they vibrate a lot and turn very erratically. 

and most of the time do not move.

i tried aligning the 2 z axis sides manually by turning the motors after disabling the steppers, that helps for a couple of seconds and then it went back to not working.

i am not sure what else i need to do.

here are 2 videos of whats going on:


https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv8kgp0zma4

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chrpczw-isc","resolved.

it turned out to be a problem with the rambo.

the z microstep motor driver came with a heat sink on it, on my board this heat sink became loose and slipped off the microstep motor driver. this caused a short circuit as it was connecting with some other electric components. 

once the heat sink was put back in its original place, the z axis problem disappeared.

i now have another problem, with the auto levelling routine that happens before every print. it seems that the ""short circuit"" cause some damage on the rambo - so it will have to be replaced  "
taz 6 -- experiences in europe,"hello,

it seems the taz 6 is a great 3d printer.... at least if you live us.

- import duties
- ordering spare parts 
within europe.

thanks for sharing,
karel.","im in england and bought my printer, as well as subsequent orders for filament and some other stuff direct from them. the prices on their website, if you're not logged in, are exclusive of vat. when you get to checkout, vat gets added on and that's the price you pay. no extra import duty or handling fees.

clack clack sound on retract taz4 budaschnozzle 2,"hi, i'm very happy with my printer after a couple of years of light to medium use. lately,  i'm noticing the printer does an increasingly loud -clack clack- sound when retracting filament; it is specially noticeable when doing series of many quick retracts. i've also noticed that there is some play between the small and large cogs of the budaschnozzle so the sound is probably the product of gear wear.

now, i am planning on printing the two gears and replacing them (wish me luck), and the question i wanted to ask is, should i add some lubricant to prevent these parts wearing again? silicon grease perhaps? has anyone tried this? has someone else experienced wear like this?

thanks.","idiot wrote:i don't know if the budaschnozzle will support it? but what about alloy 910? it's this sort of application the stuff is designed for.

taz 5 stops extruding at exactly the same point,"i work with 3d printers on a daily basis as part of my job, and one of them is a lulzbot taz 5. when i first started working with it, it was printing beautifully, but now all of the sudden, its print quality has dropped, as i will explain. i am using unpigmented pla that is in spec, and has worked well in the past. the taz will print a 50mm test cube fine, but if i try to print a 3dbenchy, or any other print, it will print the first 1/2 inch fine, then abruptly start leaving only bits of filament for a few layers, then it will extrude nothing. i have already recalibrated every axis on the printer, and the extruder axis several times, but nothing will fix the problem, that i’ve found. also it looks like it is stripping the filament very slightly, but as far as i know the idler tensioners are very close to the correct setting. please help as this is one of the nicest printers i’ve worked with, and would like it to be back to its original quality. thanks in advance.","piercet wrote:it's stopping where it transitions to the area that uses many rapid retractions. assuming nothing has changed on your retraction software settings, it's probably a loose idler arm. the distance between the washers on either side of the springs should be around 8mm to start, narrower if it's getting retraction issuesif you are already under 8mm, i'd still tighten it further also check the diameter to make sure you aren't way under on fillament diameter (2.6 or so). also check for a broken idler base, a gummed up idler bearing, or a loose small gear setscrew or loose idler arm.

enabling servo causing limit switch problem,"i'm trying to enable a servo for a z-probe.  i am wiring it to the mx1 header.  i get it to work ok by uncommenting the following line in configuration.h  (sebastian's latest marlin version).
code: select all#define num_servos 1 // servo index starts with 0 for m280 command

the servo works fine, but then the taz starts ignoring the z limit switch for homing.  i don't have a z-probe set up yet as i am testing the setup.  but the z limit switch are still enabled and hooked up.  it just seems to ignore them.

any idea what is going on?","further investigation:  when i go ahead and enable the feature all the way (#define auto_bed_leveling_feature), then g28 works okay and it responds to the z-limit sensor.  there must be something odd with the code so that when i only enable the servo (without the auto leveling to partially test it), things don't work right."
can i make a flexystruder with any hotend?,"i was thinking of tackling the project of building my own flextstruder for my taz 6. not necessarily for the cost savings but more the fun of doing it and the (hopefully) sense of accomplishment. i have no problem using a hexagon hotend, but it got me thinking, do i have to use a hexagon hotend? or, could i use something else? i'm thinking as long as it works with the wade extruder mount plate it should work. that was also said without knowing what is going to be required for the bed leveling and whether a different hotend can also be hooked up to provide the same electrical contact for the probing process. 

thanks","you can, the difficulty you will run into is that not every hotend shares the same socket depth for the channel mount. for example, a hexagon uses the same notch as the e3d v5, but the e3d v6 which uses a 5mm spacing. you will run into gaps or extruders that are too tall depending on which one you choose. either condition can be corrected for, either by altering the model or altering the final print (glue in spacer disks, bored out holes, etc. )"
control box fan always off,does anyone know how to keep the control box fan always on via the marlin firmware when it's plugged into the stock pins on the rambo?  the x-axis stepper gets very warm and appears to be making a clicking sound.  i'd like to run it w/ the control box fan on to see if i get the same clicking sound.  with the prints i've run so far w/ the newly installed flexy dually v2 firmware the fan never turns on.,"thanks.  i had bought some heat sinks from itworks3d.com a few weeks back and had installed one on the z driver chip because lulzbot did that when they went from the taz 4 (my printer) to the taz 5.  i wanted to get the control box fan going to see if that eliminated the x stepper clicking before i installed a heat sink on the x driver chip simply because that's the way lulzbot runs their machines w/out issues.

turns out one of the wires was wedged in the fan preventing it from spinning.  now w/ the control box fan running the x stepper clicking is gone, so problem solved.  i may still install a heat sink on the x driver chip since i'm printing abs in an enclosure which may cause the driver over heating issue to pop up again...keeping an eye and ear on it."
first layer issue,"i can't seem to get my first layer right. either the extruder lifts up filament when it makes a quick move or, if i lower the z endstop a tiny bit, it flattens the filament too much and it's extremely hard to remove. i cant seem to find the right balance. any tips?","a lot of settings can be tweaked... provide more info about your machine type, filament, slicer and settings...

it sounds like you are too close already.  can you slide a business card between the nozzle and pei bed surface?  should be some slight resistance.  once you establish this, use the z-code offset in your slicer software to tweak nozzle height.  if you find a good offset, you can try translating back into your endstop knob (i generally use quarter turn = ~.1mm change)

if you're printing abs and its not adhering to the pei bed, give it a sanding with a fine grit to revitalize.

try printing the attached disc, and inspect the bottom for uniform extrusion infill pattern.  it can help determine if the bed is level.


post a picture of the bottom of a calibration cube.  members of the community can critique and advise better."
taz 5 vs makergear m2e,"hi all,
first off, forgive me if i'm committing a faux pas by asking for input that compares the taz 5 with a competitor, but i've scoured the internet and it's really difficult to find forum type comparisons of this sort (most info is found in individual reviews). i'd really like to hear from the experienced community of 3d printers, understanding that experience is a currency i lack, but want to base my decision to include the experience of people who know what the heck they're doing...i hope you'll kindly indulge me.

i'm new to 3d printing, put am pretty nerdy. i'm currently enrolled in an online class learning blender because i know i won't be satisfied just printing other peoples designs alone. for me part of the thrill of 3d printing is being able to create. while i'm at it with my true confessions, i built a kit printer last november (a very inexpensive geeetech). i'm pretty mechanically inclined, but software discussions make me glaze over. once i had the machine built, i got very bogged down with all the little glitches i ran into just trying to load software so i could calibrate stuff, nothing seemed to go right (i'm pretty certain it was ignorance on my part). my fascination with 3d printing has not been dampened, but i don't want to start in the canyon (for me) while scaling this learning curve, so i've decided to get a printer professionally built and loaded and start from there.

as the title implies, i've pretty much narrowed my search to the taz or m2. up front, if cost were not a factor, i'd pretty much go with the taz 6, and honestly it's still in the running. but the amazon price on the taz 5 just came down from $2200 to $1875, making it comparable with the m2 price of $1825. beyond cost, here's where i'm at in my comparison:

both lulzbot and makergear seem to have vibrant, helpful and informative communities. both companies get high ratings from users for customer support, though the lulzbot warranty is double that of makergear (which i honestly find a 6 month warranty kinda cheesy). both machines get high marks for print quality, though the m2 seems to be slightly better in resolution? along that line, the taz 5 seems to need beefing up structurally (or have subsequent revisions corrected rod issues?).  the taz has a bigger built bed, and it's pei on aluminum vs glass, both seem better advantages for heat distribution and sticking?  the bigger build volume is important to me, i work in healthcare and fdm is being used with prosthetics and casting... bigger is better.  the m2 uses 1.75 vs 3mm filament, which they claim makes for a finer print (which i would think is more of a nozzle factor?), but it also seems more common (vhs vs betamax?). 

re the taz 6, i know it's been beefed up, has the dual cooling fans, easy to remove print head (did they fix the wobble factor by notching it?), and of course, the self leveling bed.  i'm sure ive missed stuff. are the differences worth the $700 difference? (at this point, they do not seem that way to me, but again, i have no experience). 

any feedback would be greatly appreciated, feeling pretty alone and overwhelmed (in a fun sort of way) at this point.

thanks for your indulgence.","the print heads of almost all fillament based 3d printers have almost identical resolutions. they use the same steppers, the nozzle holes are drilled the same size, the controllers they use in this case are essentially identical with the same firmware. this is true of most 3d printers in this class, not just the taz and the m2. you can essentially safely ignore that number in your considerations.  

the m2 has better bearings than the taz 5 out of the box, and the taz 6 x axis is probably equivelent. the taz 5 can be modified to a better setup than the m2 if you like. the m2 has an offset frame, which can lead to issues with the far side of the bed, the taz 5 tends to have the apperent hump in the middle issue, this is mostly resolved on the taz 6. 

3mm vs 1.75mm on fillament largely comes down to preferance. you can get fillament readily in either size, there are a few more specialty fillaments available in the 1.75mm range, but for these particular printers either choice is fine, and the taz can have a 1.75mm extruder added easily. 

spare parts availability is better with the taz printers, you can find aftermarket spares and whatnot, and the modification community for the taz printers is the best around. 

either printer will print great. there are modifications to get a superior print with the taz if you want to go that route (anti wobbles, the openbuilds rail replacements, etc.) the bearings on the m2 are very nice, their extruder setup is less so. the extruder on the taz is basically a tank, it takes a lot to kill it. 

essentially you will be happy with either printer. i think we have a better community and better support here, and i think the taz is a superior platform when taken to it's full potential, but the m2 is a very solid machine as well. i would probably put it after the mendelmax 3 on my printer choice list, but that one requires assembly."
taz 6 first layer/z axis issues,"i just got the printer in yesterday. first one, and really excited about it.

went through the initial rocktopus print and a few other resolution test prints.
so far i have noticed the initial layer is very thin, nearly translucent with the included ngen filament. i switched over to pla and it looks slightly better, but the brim is measuring out about 0.3mm. i have also noticed some issues, generally in the first few layers, where the nozzle seems to be digging into the layers below it and pushing the previous layer around. but once you go up a layer or two, it seems ok. 
the picture attached is from a 6.35x6.35 cylinder.

the bottom layers are coming out extremely smooth, but it may have been too smooth, where some of the initial prints may have damaged the pei surface a bit.
i have checked the frame for square and everything is spot on.
i have seen a few places recommend just adjusting the z height up ~0.1 or so. is this needed for every print, or is there a way to change the system settings for this? also are there any risks to making these changes?
thank you for the help.","the print shaped residue on the pei surface is normal and you can ignore it. basically the prints chemically and mechanically bond with the pei surface, and removing the part will leave a mark, but it would take you about 4 million years to wear through the pei with regular printing.  your pei is not damaged.

adjusting the z height up has no risk of damage. worst case scenario, the part doesn't stick and falls off. the taz configuration also out of the box specifies overextrusion on the first level to promote better bed adhesion. that causes the small bulge at the base of the parts, but it's a better configuration for new users since having the part fall off the bed mid print is more frustrating than having to trim a small amount of plastic. adjusting the z height down too far risks a nozzle impact with the bed which can cause damage, so make sure you take the adjustments slow and in small increments. the setting applies to all prints made with that slicer profile. you can make a test profile to play with settings and keep the stock one as is for comparison, etc. typically someone will have several profiles, a ""slow, high quality one"" a ""fast, lower quality"", and maybe a test profile or two."
taz5 cat guard build february 2016,"sharing notes from my build for future cat guard builders...

i built the cat guard enclosure for my lulzbot taz 5. the open hardware assembly instructions (ohai) are provided by lulzbot along with a bill of materials (bom). 

following bom v1.1, i was able obtain all the hardware from misumi using the part numbers provided. the total cost before shipping was $233.88. they have a nice quote system to provide an estimate before placing your order. considering all the custom cuts, ordering was easy.

i made one substitution in my order from misumi. i ordered black hinges instead of the specified stainless steel hinges. the bom v1.1 specifies 2 silver “hhpsn5-set” hinges. i changed this to 2 black “hhpbsn5-set” hinges. cost was the same. other then this substitution, i ordered the exact part numbers specified and all lengths were correct. 

in addition to the hardware, the instructions call for 5 pieces of 6mm (1/4”) acrylic. 4 with corner notches. i had harder time sourcing the acrylic. my local glass shop charged me $254.40 for the 5 pieces. they would not cut the required corner notches for a reasonable rate. i cut the notches myself.

my local glass shop would only take dimensions in inches. i sent the following dimensions to my local glass shop:

1. 30 1/8 x 20 7?8
2. 23 1?4 x 27
3. 23 1?4 x 27
4. 31 7?8 x 27
5. 31 7?8 x 23 1?4

i had to cut notches in 4 of the acrylic pieces following the cat guard plate template. i used a small hacksaw and a template i 3d printed to cut all the 6mm x 11mm notches. i’ve shared the cutting template on thingiverse.

the final component are the rubber feet ordered from advanced antivibration components for $11.04. i had to order a whole sheet of the feet. they are the same feet that come on the taz 5. i have plenty remaining in case i ever need one.  

assembly is straightforward. the instructions are easy to follow. the only issue i have is the centering of the door. the instructions say to vertically center the door but it sags.  to make it straight i had to lower the door hinges leaving a bigger gap at the top. i may fix this by printing a small support piece. still investigating.

total price: $499.32

the enclosure is big. in the photos, i have the printer sitting on a 48” tabletop.











there is a vent cover in the cat guard repository. no instructions provided. i emailed support and they are unaware of reason for the vent cover. they said as long as the internal temperatures are staying below 95 degree, there is no need to vent the electronics. the cat guard is vented at the bottom because of the rubber feet and the space around the door.","does anybody know if you would be able to mount an air filter on the back wall of one of the acrylic pieces? i am currently designing an air filter following this guide: http://www.3dprintfilemarket.com/140629194058.html
(the guide claims that you can get a filter that is 3x more efficient than a hepa filter)

instead of buying a $1500 piece of equipment like the boxes sold by 3dprintclean.com i would like to attempt to build this and install a filter.

i was also wondering if anybody had any success building this cat-guard and installing the scrubber ($300 from 3dprintclean.com) http://www.3dprintclean.com/scrubber-filtration on the back or side acrylic pane. 

i am new to cad design but i am guessing you could use brackets to mount the fan-assembly to the acrylic pane. but if it is simply being held up by behind placed into a slot inside the aluminum extrusion i  doubt it would be sturdy at all. 

feel free to reach out to me directly if you would like to collaborate on the design. i will be installing a fan-filter, raspberry pi side mount, holes for power chord and usb chord, and a side hole for the fan on the power supply,

again, any advice is appreciated. thank and best wishes,

taz 6 - just noticed the y-axis doesn't touch the table,"i will add pictures to this post when i get home and can take some, but i noticed last night that the 4 corner feet of the y-axis don't touch the desk that the printer sits on. the main housing appears to be square (i saw the bulletin about a production run where the frame could go out of square during shipping). anyway, in cleaning up some filament particles from the desk i noticed the front right corner pad wasn't touching the desk (it was about 2mm high). in looking at the others i then noticed that none of them are touching the desk. essentially the entire y-axis assembly is suspended slightly.

is this normal or should the 4 corners be touching the desk as well?

edit 7/12/2016 - added pictures of the front two feet. i believe the gaps are about the same and it is the camera angle making one look larger than the other. hard for me to get to them but it appears the rear feet are the same. if it is normal then that's fine but i'm thinking i'll probably print some longer feet, or some shims, if even just for peace of mind. i did contact lulzbot support and their initial response referenced me to the two taz 6 service bulletins about the frame being out of square after shipping and the threaded inserts being pulled out. my printer was produced after the specified serial numbers and doesn't exhibit either issue. in response i put together a quick & dirty diagram of the issue and am waiting to hear back from them.","bam wrote:heya

there's a reason you're all seeing this, it's actually an intentional part of the design of the taz 6.

with the taz 5 and before all of the feet were on the same plane, so if you set up the printer on a table that wasn't flat some of that unflatness would get translated into the y-axis and could put the xz or the yz plane out of square. on the taz 6 we decided to make the feet on the y axis a little shorter to make sure it's actually the aluminum extrusion frame being used for alignment and not the table the printer's being set up on. the taz 6 should be plenty stable resting on the feet attached to the main chassis, the feet on y are just there to keep your cat from being able to tip the printer over. cat_attack.jpg
happy printing
-bam
thanks bam for the clarification!

just to check further, if this is the case, should i try to level my taz 6? my table is pretty uneven so i placed cardboards and plastic cut-outs underneath to level it. problem is it isn't as stable as just placing it on the table.
should i just remove the levelling cardboards?"
high speed printing experiences?,"i am curious if anyone out there can share their experiences of successful (or unsuccessful) test prints at higher speeds... 

i have rarely ventured my taz 5 much above the 100mm/s as the default print speed (but often below). i have probably hit 115mm/s by adjusting the feed rate  knob while printing. has anyone pushed it to 200mm/s (reported max speed) and where they able to get good test results?
type/brand of plastic?
print settings?
quality?","sure, check out this thread for my tests with my slightly modified taz

quality being a relative term, they turned out ok. i've done some gears and whatnot as well that look nice.  0.50mm nozzle. 0.3-ish layer height."
taz5 0.5mm vs 0.35mm nozzle,"we bought a taz5 a few months back that came with a 0.5mm nozzle. we're finding that with abs at 250c, for large prints and 0.18 layer height it works great. larger prints work very well and we couldn't be happier.

recently, our need is for higher resolution prints of smaller objects. to achieve this goal we figure we need to switch to the smaller nozzle of the two most common lulzbot sizes, 0.35mm instead of 0.5mm. is this worth it? we've been looking for 0.35mm hexagon hot end nozzles for weeks but can't find any in stock anywhere. the reason for trying to switch to the 0.35mm instead of generic 0.3/0.2/0.1mm offerings is that we want to be able to preload optimized lulzbot cura settings for the 0.35mm equiped print head.

we've already purchased 0.3mm nozzles. another path for would be, can we  use them and load the 0.35mm settings and expect our prints to work without any other changes? 

what would be the ultimate taz5 nozzle to use with the hexagon hot end to achieve absolute highest resolution? we're printing custom cpu socket lids and retainers to enable test card solutions into new silicon design circuit debug equipment. some of the lids we're trying to make are only 2mm thick and about 15x15mm square. print speed doesn't matter to us for this application. high detail does and we're trying to beat our sister lab that uses the ultimaker 2+ in europe.","thanks again for all the help. we installed a generic volcano 0.3mm nozzle and changed the machine setup to the lulzbot 0.35mm toolhead. in cura before executing a test print, we also changed the nozzle field from 0.35 to 0.3.

check out the two rocktopus test prints. the farthest from the camera was done using the 0.5mm nozzle with layer height 0.18mm at 240/110c. the closer one in the field of view was using the 0.3mm nozzle with layer height 0.10mm 240/110c. there's clearly a huge improvement in detail using the 0.3mm nozzle setup. the print looks like it came from a mold instead of printed.

the only problem so far with the 0.3mm nozzle is bed adhesion (fixed by using a brim) and unwanted extrusion each time the print head lifts. as we watch the 0.3mm nozzle print we can see it lift to move across dead areas but there's still some abs extruding and leaving stringers. this is causing problems where we are trying to print structures with small screw hole openings. the openings are being partially filled by the extra material coming out between head lifts. eventually there's lots of goop where blank spaces should be.

is this easy to fix? just retraction adjustments? i know we're using a slightly smaller nozzle than the settings are optimized for but i'm not sure what to change (0.3mm vs 0.35mm)

how much heat can the stock nema motors take?,"noticed in the store that the nema motors call for a max operating temperature of 50c, i'm planning on building an enclosure for the taz5 and was contemplating whether of not i should insulate and heat it. the stepper motors get hot, just wrapping up a 40 hour print and the motor heatsinks are almost burning to the touch, aside from watercooling what other methods could i try - bonding another heatsink to the metal casing?","to answer my own question, temps of 40-50c are ok and have not hit the threshold of the air cooled hot end yet, whereas stratasys level temps of 70c+ will require either the motors to be outside the chamber or watercooling or external air flow via a duct. food for thought."
how many hours do you have on your lulzbot taz x,"im trying to price out how much to charge for a print job, so first i suppose i would need to come up with the min number of hours before major service is typically required, i know mileage will vary but im just looking for rough estimates so i can come up with a ballpark number. printer in question is a 6 but i would expect there to be a lot more data out there on the older models so i any models will do.

thanks","sealfab wrote:do you mean random print failures or hardware?

i am not sure what joshuanapoli was referring to, but i can give an idea from my normal job (3d printing is just to relax from that  )
as soon as you want to create income from machinery some random failure / machinery break down has to be considered.

saying that i appreciate that you are already looking into the right direction with your question!! (where is the thumbs up emo???)
even though i have no interest at all to charge any body for 3d prints (i have a totally different daily job) i found your question interesting enough to start some ""research"".  the numbers below i am sure are not really representative but i believe they can give an impression in ball parks that should be considered for a business .

it seems that even today 3d printing is still in its beginnings and there for difficult some reasonable numbers. never the less here what i have figured:

average mtbf (mean time before fault / failure) for a 3d fff printer seems to be apr. 1800 hours. 
this mtbf could be longer if there  would not be spurious  failures of machines. about 15% of all reports i found had a machine failure after it was working fine, but before it reached 500 hours.

again: i know this is not a proper research, but more a quick data collection and from there an best guess  statistics live and die with the information basis and below is how i generated mine:
with the help of google i found 487 considerable statements for working time before first major repair.
major repair i called everything that required spare parts which are not available without order / shipping time.

if i use the above mentioned data i would calculate the following:
printer usage 24/7 gives 8760 hours. considering the apr. 1800 hours mtbf you have 4.86.... let us say 5 machine failures per year.
in other words: every 2.4 month the printer fails and needs spare parts that you might not have on stock.
from here i am going to be very pessimistic 
i am not sure for 3d printers, but for a rule of thumb i would use 20% of new price / year as spare parts. 
considering that delivery times for spare parts can easily be 4 weeks a second printer should be considered to keep business running. 

for all that disagree to my numbers: you might be totally right   

all the best

taz 5 pla have to cold pull after every print,"i am working with a new taz 5. i have a lot of experience working with them in the past, but this particular one is totally fresh. i am printing with pla and have tried temps ranging from 190-210.

my prints work fine for the most part. however, after every time i've printed and let the head cool down, the next time i try to print i get no extrusion except a few little spots. i cold pull the material, re-heat the nozzle, re-insert material, and then it works fine until i let it cool down again. it seems that the pla is melted and reformed all the way up to the bolt and toothed gear that pushes against it. it seems like it may be melting too far up the filament and then getting stuck once it cools. however i can't tell if this is really the problem, as i don't know if it normally does this.

how do i deal with this? i never had this problem on previous machines. i have searched these forums and google for information on heads not extruding, but they all seem to only cover cleaning or cold pulling the head. i have no trouble getting it to work again, but i don't want to have to cold pull it every single print.","drudge wrote:hey folks, thanks for the advice. i've been running the printer longer now and am still having the same issue, but am back with some more information.

the problem is still that it often stops extruding partway through a print. when i open up the head, what i find is that the teeth of the bolt have scraped out a big groove in the filament, leaving it with no traction to continue pushing the filament down. i often also find that the filament has lumped up or twisted right below the bolt, like one of those twisty straws. 
img_20160603_125751167.jpg

so for whatever reason, something stops the filament from being able to go into the extruder. the bolt then continues trying to turn and push it down, but this causes it to get stuck and carve a groove out. but why is it getting stuck in the first place?

i've had this problem with pla, pla(h), pet, and abs, at a variety of different temperatures and retraction settings. whenever i cold pull, it works fine for awhile. the jam usually occurs after 1 hour of printing. if the problem was some other material remaining in the extruder, i'd expect it to happen sooner. and i've had times where i printed several things in a row (10+ hours of printing) without a problem. if it was some flaw in the extruder itself, i would expect it to happen more consistently.

what could be causing this?

i'm not sure if you have already solved this problem but i was wondering, are you using a standard print head? the one with the mini blower? i noticed on my taz 5  i was having clogging issues and it was heat creep. the mini blower wasn't cooling the upper part of my nozzle enough and my filament was getting soft and clogging. i would have to let my printer completely cool down and then i could print a handful of parts before it acted up again. i don't know if this helps, but if you do have the original head, try upgrading to the taz 6 head.

taz 5 calibration print,"let me preface this by saying i come from the world of cnc machining.  i am a tecnician that maintained the electronic and computer components of these machines.  however i'm fairly new to 3d printing.  so my prints are coming out pretty nicely, but there are some anomalies.  when i print the calibration print, i see a couple corners that don't have a nice round radius.  if it was a cnc machine i'd adjust the servo gain for whichever axis was off.  but i don't know how to do that with this machine.  any suggestions?

mark -","usually out of round sections indicates a loose belt in the direction it is off. best way to figure that out is print a hole calibration object from thingiverse or the like, measure the hole, if it is squished in the x direction, tighten the x belt, etc. that being said, there are other corner specific issues you may see. if you get your filament too hot or a couple of other issues related to that, you can see a bulge during sharp direction changes due to molten plastic sloshing. imagine a glass of water half empty that you are carrying while you move down a really fast treadmill and you abruptly stop. the water keeps going and splashes towards the path of least resistance. in a 3d printer that is down and out the nozzle . you will usually see that at an abrupt transition from x to y motion, and why many designers avoid sharp corners in 3d prints. y to x isn't as much a problem because that's the start of extrude motion. you may also want to look up ""ringing"" in relation to 3d prints."
taz 4.1 extruder motor problems,"my taz 4 (stock, no modifications) has been having extruder problems for some time now. the first few layers of a print are fine, but as the print proceeds it has more and more problems feeding filament. while feeding, it frequently makes a loud ""buzzing"" noise and you can see the large gear stop turning and backlash a small amount. the stop/backlash is also visible on the smaller gear and the shaft of the motor. the problem gets worse as the print goes on.

when the problems first started, support suggested performing some cold pulls, but that did not help. i've since taken apart the extruder twice and thoroughly cleaned it. after cleaning, the tube, heater, and nozzle have no obstructions, and with tension removed from the hobbed bolt i can easily extrude material by pushing filament into the hot extruder.

i've bought a new roll of pla filament (esun pla+) to replace my old roll of gizmo dorks pla, and that did not help. 

after running some more experiments, i'm beginning to think either there is a problem with the extruder motor or the drivers on the rambo board.

what i've observed is:
 - towards the end of a print, the temperature of the extruder motor is as high as 190f. that seems excessive. that was with the extruder set to 210 (recommended print temp for the esun pla+)
 - when not printing, extruder heater off, cold extruder lockout disabled, no filament installed, i can continuously run the extruder motor and no amount of pressure i apply to the large gear will stop the motor. it has gobs of torque, as expected.
 - if i let it sit with the extruder hot (210) and perform the same test, i still can't stop the motor.
 - if i run a real print, once the noises start happening and the motor is hot, i can press my thumb on the large gear and stop the extruder motor or sometimes rotate it backwards. at some point it seems the torque of the motor drops dramatically.

i've now zip tied a 40mm heatsink and fan to the side of the extruder motor. the motor temperature has dropped to about 100f, so that's an improvement, but the problem still remains. there appears to be a significant loss of torque mid-print.

what can i do to diagnose this further? does it sound like the motor needs to be replaced? or could this be a problem with a bad driver on the rambo board (it's a 1.3l version i think).

looking at this thread, a failed driver isn't unheard of: viewtopic.php?t=1693

i have not tried rebuilding the firmware to use the second extruder port yet, but i can.

thoughts?","well, i've disconnected the cables at the controller and checked for shorts and breaks (both flexing the cable a lot and moving the x axis) and found no problems.

also checked for shorts and breaks on the stepper motor, first when it was cold, and then when it was hot and failing, no problems there either. 2.8 ohms on the coils when cold, about 3.4 when hot (~140f on the top surface of the motor).

i did discover then when i powered it back up and re-engaged the motors (still reasonably hot), i could no longer rotate the large gear by hand. motor had full torque.

i normally print with simplify3d, but just for fun i'm trying a print with the latest cura just to rule out software as a culprit. if that fails, i guess i'll try moving the motor to the other extruder port on the controller and see what happens."
taz 5 only extrudes filament for a couple of seconds,"hi everyone, i just started having this problem today. after having swapped a filament roll on my taz 5, i tried to print a part out. everything was going fine for a few minutes, but then i noticed that it wasn't extruding anything and the filament wasn't being fed anymore - all while still printing. i assumed this was no big deal, so i retracted the filament, trimmed it, and tried extruding it through cura. it extruded for a few seconds, but then it just stops. i have tried this again 4 times with the same result. i then found a chipped-off part from the extruder assembly under the printer, and i think this has something to do with it. can anyone confirm whether this is the cause of the problem. also, how can i go about on replacing it?","hi fallout

if i am not mistaken and the broken part is part of the ""arm"" that is pressing the filament against the hobbed bolt.
if the filament is not properly pressed against the hobbed bolt it will not be pushed into the hot end.

to cut it short:
get that one peace replaced. if you have access to another printer you can even print it yourself.

all the best

taz 5 broken belt,i have a tz 5 and the belt broke.  i was looking at the parts and i see the gt2 belt.  is that a direct replacement or do i need the 16 tooth timing pulley to go with it?,a gt2 belt is a direct replacement. its one of several standards.
taz z-axis grinding at start of print,"i recently inherited responsibility for a taz printer at my workplace. it has been in operation for a couple of years, however the person who used to operate it no longer works here, so i am having to learn on my own. 

it's been going pretty well so far, except that occasionally when i press print in cura, when it tries to move upwards on the z-axis in order to re-adjust the position on the bed, rather than moving it just makes a grinding noise, then proceeds to move across and downwards, causing the hot end to gouge into the bed. luckily i have always intercepted it before it does any real damage.

this is frustrating because it means i have to cancel and re-start the print, sometimes several times, before it works properly. i know it's not something simple like a jammed z-axis screw, because it works properly sometimes, and when i move the z-axis up and down using printrun it responds perfectly. this problem also sometimes causes the x-axis bars (sorry i don't know the proper terminology!) to become skewed, and need re-leveling, which makes me think it is a problem with just one of the z-axis screws.

thanks so much for any insight!","when it does the home function which is what you see at the first. it moves at a faster rate than when using the manual movement buttons. so the z axis binds because it creates more friction doing this fast movement. so you need to release the tension of the x axis belt and release the twist on the z axis the x axis has on the z lead screws by loosening the set screws on both x rods and finding the point the rods will set loosely on the rods then tighten them back down and then tighten the x axis belt back to proper tension again.

you have a very slight pull inwards/outwards on one side that is applying too much pressure to one of the smooth rods by the igus bearing. i have seen a couple printers with this issue before.  "
taz 6 dual extruder questions,"i got the taz 6 with a single extruder a couple of weeks back, and just got the dual extruder.

1. 1st of all, out of curiosity, is there any good reason to move back and forth between the single and dual extruder (other than the heavier mass and potentially slower speed of the dual)?

2. do you have to flash the firmware each time you move back and forth? and out of curiosity, if so, is this because there is not enough memory to store in the ardunino both versions?

3. on the taz 6, do you have to recalibrate anything moving between the single and dual extruder types, or does the bed auto-leveling take care of that (although i doubt it, see next question)?

4. how come the dual extruder start gcode does not have bed auto-leveling or wiping built into it? i know the wipe area for both nozzles together is effectively much shorter, but could still be done.

5. this may be a noobie question (and possibly i don't have the dual extruder set up properly yet), but why does the dual extruder squirt out filament from both extruders after homing (off the left side of the bed and onto my table) before starting the print?

6. the dual extruder connectors are almost impossible to connect to the matching cables. i had to cut the tie wraps on the extruder side to give more flex to allow hooking up the connectors easily. any thoughts on this?

thanks!","thanks for the info. a couple of followups...

i'm using lulzbot cura right now (and driving it via octopi), and the start.gcode and start2.gcode don't seem to have any leveling at all for the dual. i don't see why the back extruder couldn't be used to level the bed (although if both extruder are not even with the plane of the bed, i could see issues). but is it suppose to level?

pla doesn't stick to the heated bed?,"hello,

i bought taz 2 a couple of months ago and it is working all fine working with the natural abs. however, i switched it to the pla which i bought from voxel factory, the pla does extrude out from the printer but it does not stick to heated bed. this result in an untidy mesh of filament stuck around the filament when nozzle is ""printing"". worse still, when i switched back to abs again, the abs filament now also has the same problem.

i tried setting the heated bed from 60 to 80 degrees from pla and 80 degrees for abs. do you all have any solution?","hi, i had the same exact problem that you did and found your post while trying to find out how to fix this. i went from a badly clogged nozzle using hips filament to pla. after clearing the clogged nozzle, i used the blue painters tape and got the extruder just as close to the print bed as you would with abs. i also used cura instead of prontrface and slic3r. i was able to print inside the cura program using ultimaker settings. it set the temperature at 220c (which i thought was way too high at first) and the bed at 50c (bed not sure if needed to be heated) but it worked this way. i'm able to print a fast print of a grand theft auto5 sign. i know how frustrating this can be because it took me all afternoon to get some kind of result, so i hope this helps anyone else out there. here are some pics in progress:"
taz 5 extruder issue,"hi guys,

i have a slightly modified taz 5 (larger fan) that is having extruder issues. 

the problem: hot end stops extruding mid print causing a failed print (please see pictures) http://m.imgur.com/a/5qyfi

filament:
picutured: esun pla+ printed at 220 
also tried: hatchbox pla printed at 205 & 210. argos pla printed at 205.

attempts to find a fix:

1) updated cooling fan from tiny centrifugal fan 5v to larger fan for hot end. 
2) retuned pid controller for hot end adjusting k values. 
3) removed .35mm nozzle and replaced with .5mm brand new nozzle.
4) printed at various retraction values starting at 1.5mm going down to 1mm.
5) triple checked distance between nozzle and print bed to eliminate back pressure. 

conclusion
after all of this i am still not able to complete a full print!! so frustrating. 
i am going to try an switch out the thermocouple tonight to see if its a bad one but otherwise i think im outta luck ","piercet wrote:what voltage is the larger fan? specifically is it a 5v fan, or a 12v fan? the picture looks like pla bore lock to me which would indicate inadequate barrel cooling of the hotend.

weird extrusion issue,"i have a taz5. i've put well over 1500-2500 hours on it.  it has open beam x, stock z and y.

i'm currently printing on hatchbox abs at 230/90 with no fan.  i've used about 10lbs of this plastic with no issues.  i'm also printing 3mm shells and 75% infill and printing slow at 35mms, .3mm layers.

when i noticed the problem i rotated the part 90 degrees to try and narrow it down to a single axis.  it seams to effect both.

i measured the stepper temps they range from 130-150f.

it looks like an odd over extrusion issue.  prints were perfect prior to a couple days ago.  same slicer settings.

i pulled the extruder carriage to inspect, no obvious issues.  swapped to a fresh roll of filament no difference. 

also the extruder does grind on top of the over extruded part but not on the smooth part.

any help is appreciated","idiot wrote:piercet wrote:which direction was that sitting on the bed? you've got some ringing going on after the idler latch screw holes in what i'm guessing was your y axis. you may want to check the bearings for debris and contact pattern on the rods when you get a chance.

what's ringing? is it that vertical wavy pattern?

yup, ringing gets its name from the easiest way to detect it, a faint circle shape just after a hole in an object. what happens is that for a given layer containing a cylendrical hole, it basically shows up in a given layer as a rectangular void in the layer. printing that hole starts with an x axis movement transitioning to y, or vice versa. when that movement starts, if the rod is gummed up it will start to move and be pulled along by the bearing, but friction from the rod will slow it enough that you get one or more faint buildup areas in that perimiter. think of it like pushing something heavy or stuck. it's difficcult at first, but once you get it going it's ok as long as it doesn't stop again. if it stops you have to use more force to get it moving agian. 

the friction usually doesn't go away in subsequent layers, and its usually about the same amount of friction so you end up with a similar blob in the perimiter exactly the same distance from the start of the hole. since each following layer gets closer to closing the hole, the position of the blob follows the hole. the distance is the same, the starting point isn't. 

thats why ringing can be frustrating. it sometimes occurs lower down and then magically dissappears at the next identical hole because the gum in the bearing worked its way out. or a piece of depbris will fall into a bearing mid print, screw up one hole, then work its way out for the rest of them, etc. 

there are things that look like ringing that aren't. really thin walls right after a hole can tend to ripple due to heat and look like ringing sometimes. majorly excess belt tension can also produce a ringing effect, though in my oppinion if your belt tension can make it do that, you need to redesign your axis to take stronger belt tension."
"printing taz parts with pet, nylon, amphora etc.","so i have been trying to print a flexystruder for my taz 4 for a while and i keep running into issues. 
1) which material to use
2) best settings to use
3) shrinkage/warping/infill

what materials will work, and moreso, what materials would be better or worse? anything that prints at abs temperatures or higher, and isn't too flexible, should work. so for everything except the gears(which i printed in taulman bridge) i am going for visual aesthetics. so i have 3 materials which i like alot, t-glase, nvent, and alloy 910(can be dyed). which would have the best properties? i think t-glase looks the best. so i printed 2 flexustruders, one out of t-glase, and one out of alloy 910. here are some pictures below:

as you can see the prints warped about 1-2mm from the bed in the corners with both materials 
i used 75% infill in cura, and this brings me to the question of, how much infill is necessary when printing the part with a much stronger material
than abs for it to handle the same load? i'm sure that it would not have warped if i had set the infill lower.
has anyone else tried using other materials beside abs/pla to make taz build parts? can anyone answer some of my questions? i really would enjoy some feedback.
thanx,
sun","i just did a warping test on a flat petg part of about the same area as yours but only 4 mm thick.  one was printed with and one without the cooling fan.  the rest of the settings were identical each time.

one was printed with 100% fan speed starting at layer 3, the other was printed with the fan completely off for the entire print.

there was clearly less warping with the fan completely off, it was about half as much as with the fan on.

also, the way you orient the infill will have a big effect on warping.  if you can use unidirectional infill, the part will warp more along the axis aligned with the infill walls and less on the axis at right angles to the infill.  depending on how many directions your stresses come from you can sometimes use that to advantage."
bed flatness,"how flat should i expect the glass bed of the taz to be?  i am seeing measurements of 0.010 inches higher in the middle of the glass compared to the edges.  this is with the bed at 85c or at room temp.

would the x rails twist that much as the carriage moves across?

","orias wrote:one way to check to see if the rods are flexing due to weight would be to remove the weight, by removing the extruder assembly when testing.

you'll find though, that any variences work themselves out rather well. even if there was a difference of 0.5mm across the bed/printing plane (for whatever reason), with the multiple solid bottom surface layers it would work itself out. the first layer may be thick on one side, and thin on the other, or towards the middle, but that would be both covered and filled in by the second and third layer.

sure there may be a theoretical difference in the height of the model after it's been printed, a difference of 0.1mm - 0.5mm is negligable at the scales we are printing- even (12^3). i'm sure that some of the beds in our fleet of 3d printers have beds that are not perfectly level, even with that, we are able to crank out beautiful well-fitting parts after part. 

in my personal experience with several different 3d printers, both my own and my friends (prusa i1, i2, i3; printrbot, replicator, rostock, taz, tazmini, ao-101, cupcake, tantilus, mmax 1.5, mmax 2.0, etc) we have yet to come across any issues with a printing plane that's not perfectly flat. at the scales we print at, (0.1mm - 0.5mm layer height) sub 12^3 inch items won't show any kind of issues.

when printing at sub 0.1mm layer heights, you'll typically be printing something small in scale anyways, or encounter other issues before the printing plane causes any hiccups- due to how well your slicing settings need to be balanced.

thanks for the input. i realize it doesn't have to be perfect it just seems wrong that the extrusion thickness in the middle of the bed has to be super thin just to get it to stick closer to the edge...

my taz is having multiple problems. once i receive the new heated bed, claudio is going to help me with the retraction problem and hopefully get this machine squared away."
leveling the y axis - getting rid of high / low spots,"i bought two taz 4's and one of them always printed the 1st layer much thinner in the center of the bed compared to the four corners.  this occurred after utilizing the stock four corner clips to level the print surface as prescribed by lulzbot.  at first i thought this was due to the 10mm x-axis smooth rods bending under the weight of the extruder.  i dispelled this hypothesis when i installed the bowden style version of the e3d cyclops hot end to the x-axis which substantially reduced the weight on the x-axis, but did nothing to get rid of the thin 1st layer in the center of the bed.

this led me to believe that the bed must be bulging in the center instead of the x-axis drooping.  at this point i suspected that leveling the glass bed utilizing the four corner clips as prescribed by lulzbot was over constraining the glass causing it to bulge in the center (this turned out to be true).  i upgraded my taz 4 to the taz 6 x, y and z axis upgrades including the auto bed leveling hoping this would somehow fix things with all the fancy improvements the upgrades would bring.  instead of a bulge in the center of the bed i now had a saddle shaped bed where the front left / back right corners printed thinner and the back left / front right corners printed thicker.  to illustrate this see pic 1 showing a calibration print and pic 2 showing a close up of the thin front left corner.  both pics show the 1st layer because that's when thin spots are most visible.



 pic 1 




 pic 2 


now i was onto something.  i checked the levelness of the two y smooth rods against each other (see pic 3 and pic 5) and found that the back of the right smooth rod was low.  i unscrewed the four y axis idler installation screws (circled in pic 3) and four y axis motor assembly installation screws (opposite side of pic 3).  next i unscrewed the thumb screws that secure the y axis to the taz frame (pic 4).  now the y axis was relaxed enough for me to try to level it properly.



 pic 3 




 pic 4 




 pic 5 


i had to stack two metal rulers under the back right foot of the y axis to level the two y rods to each other (see pic 6).  the two metal rulers raised the back right side of the y axis 0.96 mm.



 pic 6 


now i tightened everything back up.  alas, this did the trick.  i finally leveled my bed.  the first layer is now going down beautifully in all four corners and in the center of the bed.  as an example pic 7 in my post below shows the front left corner and pic 8 shows the front right corner after performing the y rod leveling trick.  only 6 pics are allowed per post; hence the reason for these pics going to a second post.  i measured the first layer across the entire calibration print and found only a 0.06 mm difference which means the entire print bed is now level to within 0.06 mm. this is plenty good for the 0.2 mm layer heights i typically print.

pic 9 below shows how nice the entire calibration print now looks.

i could probably dial it in further by getting a digital level, etc, but no need to spend time on something that won't make a difference in the quality of my prints.  i'd rather spend time making cool prints.

thoughts: lulzbot should make it a point to include leveling the y rods against each other in the assembly instructions.  y axis adjustable height corners / legs would be very helpful in accomplishing this step.","pics 7, 8 and 9 as mentioned in above post:

taz 4 3 point bed mounting,has anyone modded their taz for a 3 point bed mounting system?  it makes sense that leveling 3 points would be easier than 4.  i'd be interested to hear what people have come up with.,"as long as the bed is flat 3 points would be easier.  as long as you can put your sensor/dial indicator right over the top of the adjustment points.  i prefer a dial indicator but then i have been indicating stuff in on cncs for 35 years.
but if the sub frame is stiff enough more points give you the ability to tweek the bed a little."
dial gauges,"i ordered digital dial gauge. should arrive tomorrow.  i've seen people connect it to the x axis rails.  and i've seen people connect it to the tool head.   what are the pros/cons of each approach?  i imagine the x axis will help with bed leveling, but still may leave you looking for paper to adjust z stop.  (i could use help with both . does connecting it to the tool head help with z stop?   i also imagine connecting it close to the head is best given the slight sag that an unmodified taz is reported to have.  

i recently upgraded to the flexy dually (if that changes the recommendation at all).","i use two dial gauges on either side of the toolhead to measure the corners simultaneously. adjusting one corner will affect the other.  with both readouts, it gets dialed in pretty quick.

and likewise, adjusting the front of the bed will affect the back... and vise-versa.

putting the dial gauges to the side of the toolhead, negates the need to remove and re-install the toolhead.  the benefit is that you can establish an optimal initial nozzle height which can be accurately replicated.  so you kill 2 birds with one stone.  

the following dial gauge mount snaps onto the x-rods: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:407454
it works well, but i found that it holds onto the 10mm rods too tight... attached is a slightly modified version which clips to the top rod, but rotates onto the bottom rod.  the mod seemed to make sense to me... but i haven't published on thingiverse.

if interested, here's my basic process (best if you pre-establish a good iniital nozzle height):
- home xy & z
- turn off motors
- move toolhead to center of x-axis, to create space on either side for the dial gauges.
- raise the toolhead so the dial gauges can be attached approximately in the corner.
- do not home xy.  if you do, the toolhead will run into the left dial gauge, and won't stop for a few seconds... making a pretty gut wrenching noise of the belt slipping.
- turn on and zero the dial gauges
- do not home xy
- home z
- adjust corners.
- re-home z and check / adjust corners
- slide the bed forward and adjust the back and perform the previous 3 steps.  if you can't move the bed by hand, turn off the motors from the lcd.
- slide the bed back and re-check the front.

if you've dialed in your initial nozzle height, note down the measurement.  next time you level the bed, adjust to that golden number.  bed will be level and initial nozzle height will be achieved.    ready to print!

hope that helps, sorry if its too much information."
new taz 6 need help please with dimensional accuracy,"hi guys,

<model size>/<measured size>*<firmware default steps> = <new steps>

example:

40 mm cube model measures 40.2mm on x axis but 40mm on y. assumed default firmware settings for steps on axis and flow rate.

40/40.2*100.5 = 100 <- new x axis steps value

so you would update the x axis setting in the configuration menu with the new steps you have just calculated. y would not need changed as it has no error in size. but if y did have a size difference you would calculate and update its steps also.

the x/y steps are located in the same advanced settings as the extruder steps. see step 6 here

1) when exporting the 40mm cube to stl (i'm using rhino3d). there are some settings for tolerances as shown here.





will this impact the accuracy of the print?

taz 6 adhesion/levelling problems,"hi,

we just got two new taz 6's last week. so excited!

one of them is working great. it's been running basically non-stop since it came in. the other... not so great.

we've tried printing in pla and abs, sliced with both cura and simplify3d. we're getting weird problems with bed adhesion. we've cleaned the bed sheet several times. 

at first i thought it was just that the printer needed to be squared. the lower left corner of the plate was significantly lower than the rest of the plate, leading to poor adhesion on the lower left. adhesion elsewhere was fine. this is what the feet on the bad printer looked like:

http://imgur.com/dmudzkn

but the good printer: http://imgur.com/j2aan00

this was leading to the left front corner of the y axis being elevated by over 2mm. 

so, we loosened the brackets on the bad printer that connect the left-side 80/20 to the control box and lined up the feet. 

now adhesion there is better, but elsewhere it's a problem. this is this morning's print in pla:

http://imgur.com/vipbg7n

it's the exact same gcode file that printed correctly, with no problems, on the other printer, so i know the file is fine.

i see a little bit of bubbling, etc., on the plate. maybe that matters?

taz 5 wavy base layer,"i am having a problem getting an even first layer print on my taz 5 as you can see in the attached photo of a print that i cancelled. the wavy pattern always seems to start along the edges that are parallel to the x axis (bottom and top of photo).  i am trying to obtain a print that has a relatively flat and smooth surface approx 260mm (x) by 170mm (y) at layer 1.5 mm on the z axis, but the rough first layer seems to preclude this. 

i have the problem with abs, abs/polycarbonate alloy and hips.  i have used cura and simplify 3d control software. i have experimented with different z stop settings, first layer extrusion multipliers, layer heights and extrusion widths. i have levelled the bed before each print.  i noticed some play in the y axis bearings and replaced them with lb10uu bearings. i now notice some play in the three x axis bearings (on the print head carrier) and have ordered replacements for them.  

should i be trying something else?  any feedback is appreciated!",i have similar problem with my taz 6 but only occasionally. i think it is caused by plastic residue on the nozzle which affects the bed leveling so that it thinks the bed is lower than it is. when i clean the nozzle everything is fine. try making the gap between your bed and nozzle a bit larger as was already suggested.
taz 6 temperature calibration,"i apologize if this has been covered.  i searched the board but the search capabilities are pretty lame.

thanks for any input.
ian","thanks for the response frank.  i will check the thermistor type.    i also sent the question to ao support and i got the following response.  i wanted to post it in case it is useful for someone else.  i have not yet tried what they suggested.  i wanted to brush up a little on pid controllers before i did.

hello ian,

sorry about these temperature issue. yes there is a bit of a temperature offset, it's like a set of values so that your hotend knows how much power it needs to reach specific temperatures and they are called ""pid settings."" normally our printers are shipped with accurate pid settings, but if it is showing to be off we can adjust them.

allow your hot end to cool to room temp. in the terminal in cura, send the following command: m303 s230 if extruding abs at 230. change the number in the command to reflect the temperature at which you normally extrude. the m303 sxxx command will tune the extruder. use m303 e-1 sxxx to tune the bed. the hot end will then heat up and finally cool, while logging the temperature. when completed, similar values will be displayed:

bias: 101 d: 101 min: 145.48 max: 154.02 ku: 64.06 tu: 29.67 clasic pid kp: 38.04 ki: 2.35 kd: 147.63

enter that information into your start gcode in slic3r using the following format, with your values substituted appropriately:

m301 p38.04 i2.35 d147.63 or for the heated bed: m304 p38.04 i2.35 d147.63

enter the following command to save the pid settings to eeprom.

m500

reslice your model. your temperature fluctuations should be lessened and more consistent.

i hope that helps. if there is anything else we can do to assist in the meantime please let us know."

- fitznyc







","it might be a nozzle cleaning and leveling problem.  i had similar issues with the flexydually.  the abs nozzle would clog.  the problem was that the cleaning gcode was insufficient in cleaning the nozzle.  so the leveling routine would push hard on the washer to smash the plastic out of the way to make contact with the washer.  this inturn would case the code to think that the bed was lower than it actually was so the nozzle would be too close to the bed when it started printing.  in my case the part would print fine, but the nozzle would be clogged when trying to print a second part.  i made significant changes to the way the rear nozzle is cleaned on the flexydually and my problems went away.

i need to buy bed corners, bed fingers, springs, washers and screws. in other words, i need bed corners kit. i can't print them because i can't level my bed. my bed corners are broken. 

i was able to find bed corners here https://itworks3d.com/product/taz-abs-bed-corners/

but i don't have the fingers, springs, washers and screws...    

can anyone help me?

thx","e-mail it works directly, they will almost certainly be able to make you a kit with the other parts.  the other hardware can be sourced locally or online using the taz bill of materials file from download.lulzbot.com. it is an ods file, which microsoft excel can open.

you basically need some m3 bolts and washers, small springs that will fit an m3 bolt, anything that says bed springs online should work fine. you can make the bed hold down plates out of aluminum with a set of sheers and a drill."
micro blower fan to regular axial fan change,"hello, 
can anyone say why have they given up on micro blower fan? 
if you take a look at the stock taz6 heat sink fan, it is once again the regular one-
https://ohai.lulzbot.com/media/uploads/ ... x0_q85.jpg","nopick wrote:the micro fan was barely adequate when it was running at 100%. anytime the fan started to fail and blow slightly less air, folks printing heat conductive plastic like pla would have heat creep jams in the cold section. that and the fans are hard to source and expensive are the reasons i imagine they changed. i have personally had several problems with those small fans.
piercet wrote:the tiny fans also had like a 25% failure rate near as i can tell.

well, i've read somewhere in the forum that actually the regular fan had less power than the micro blower. 
i've also had a chance to verify myself, having had both options. 
axial (turbine) fan had more power in my case. 
only, i've used a bigger one, that was 24v 

so.. here is my setup, in the image below- 
the issue i am battling with is that i have too much pressure from the melt chamber. also i print all the filaments much cooler that it is said for the hexa. my pla is printed in 180c (colorfabb)
 i get too much ooze, that even the retraction 40speed 4mm length, cannot handle. also get a lot of stringing during travel as well. (travel speed up to 200)
this fan i've put on the fins is cooling them i think well enough. during print, i touch the fins and they are cool. 

if anyone has an opinion.. could the problem be that the stock hexa i am using has different and smaller heat block?  
or should i try to replace the thermistor and the heater cartridge for starters..

taz 6 skipping commands at end of gcode files,"hey all,

i'm messing around with moving the auto bed leveling step to a separate gcode file (to be run before printing), and i'm running into an issue where commands at the end of the file are not being run.  the number of commands skipped seems to vary.

this is a bit of gcode displaying the issue when run from an sdcard:
code: select allg21                          ; set units to millimetres

m109 s150                    ; soften filament for retraction

g90                          ; abs positioning
g92 e0                       ; set extruder abs position to 0

g28                          ; home

; steps that are visibly being skipped
g1 f500 x0 y280              ; move to top left corner
g1 f75 e-5.0                 ; retract filament
g1 f75 e0.0                  ; extrude filament back into nozzle


this code is the same, but with some random filler commands appended.  the steps that were skipped before are executed, but some new ones at the end are being skipped.
code: select allg21                          ; set units to millimetres

i originally noticed this with longer files (50 lines).  i haven't tested beyond that length, but the default code appended by cura seems to run all the way through.

i updated the printer's firmware to the latest (1.0.2.19) while trying to find the issues.  no change.  i'm using the sd card that came with the printer, and the whole thing arrived in the mail yesterday.

taz 6 wiping not centered,"hello

i have a taz 6 but the wiping it does on the felt pad isn't centered. it ends up wiping along the right edge and hits the plastic.

i tried updating the gcode by making it subtracting 2 more from the x dimensions, so -17 instead of -15 and -19 instead of -17. this made it perfectly centered but then after it was done wiping it messed up the leveling process (so i must have messed up something else with th gcode). re-loading a profile put it back to what it was doing before.

is there some way to globally offset things -2 x? or is there another way i should handle this?","i have an even worse wiping issue. the first time i used the printer (i received it a few days ago) the nozzle wipe worked correctly, but after that it now tries to wipe on the bed rather than the pad and it wipes in the x direction rather than y (far from the pad, in the back left quadrant of the bed). so, this isn't simply a problem of the bed being out of position.

and yet, it taps the microswitch in the correct position, and it seems to print okay.

has anyone else encountered something like this?

[edit] never mind--a factory reset fixed the problem. tech support speculates that my taz 6 may have gotten instructions intended for a mini, which has its wiping pad at right angles to that of the taz. makes sense to me!

[edit 2] not fixed! even after a factory reset, it keeps reverting back to a mini wipe instead of a taz wipe. so, my nozzle is becoming all gunked up and i'm getting probe failures. not happy...  "
"taz 5 x-axis stops moving but motor is still running, how to fix?","i've had my taz 5 for about half a year now, and every once in a while my x-axis stepper motor won't drive the belt. i can hear the motor turning, but the axle itself doesn't move. this results in the print job suddenly becoming 2d, ruining the print. the motor makes a much louder whine as it fails to turn the axle.

my quick fix for now is to loosen the belt and move the carriage left and right, then re-tighten the belt and verifying it works. it'll work for another few prints (~5ish), then the problem will resurface. my guess is that i'm overloading the motor somehow, but not sure if that's really what's going on. i haven't done any disassembly other than that, but wondering if other people have experienced this before.

i do notice that my z-axis is slightly out of alignment, ~0.5mm, though i highly doubt from reading other threads that this little misalignment is causing the issue. the motor isn't hotter than the other motors (sensing by touch), and the axle on the stepper motor appears to be straight enough.

has anyone else seen this, and if so what was the best fix?","if the motor is turning but nothing is happening, that usually indicates that the motor pulley setscrew is loose. if tightening that or replacing the pulley doesn't do the trick, you may be ending up with a wire short. a stepper motor basically has 2 sets of wires that drive two coils. if one of those coils has a short, or even worse, is reversed, the motor will not turn. think of it like two people trying to push a car down a road, if they both push the same direction, the car moves. if one pushes the opposite direction, or if one gets tired and stops pushing, the car doesn't move, or only moves a little. check all the cable fittings from the motor to the board, and if you don't find anything, consider replacing the wire run entirely for that axis. 

it is theoretically possible to break a motor shaft, but if that was broken, it wouldn't be working at all anymore. 

overheating on the rambo board can also cause something similar, but usually it will be all axes, not just x. check that your electronics case fan is running while the printer is printing. on some firmware versions, it slows down when the printer is idle."
horrible print help!,"hello forum
i am using the taz5 with cura 19.12 i am submitting a few pics for your visual as to assit you in providing me with any advice or help. i have printed these parts before 2 days ago before today.








 they are just rectangle shapes.","your extruder steps per unit will be included on your test acceptance paperwork, and will be unique for each machine. (these are calibrated before leaving the factory.) the esteps/mm is the only setting you need to update. 

the other corresponding values correspond to movement controls. 

a-retract = acceleration of retraction moves
xsteps/mm = movement control in x
ysteps/mm = movement control in y
zsteps/mm = movement control in z
esteps/mm = how much filament you extrude (guide for manually determining this)

all of these settings (minus retract) are determined by hardware. if you swap out any movement control items (belt, pulley, pitch of lead screw, etc) on your x/y/z axis these numbers will need to be updated to reflect that change. at the same point, esteps will be unique to each tool head. when swapping between tool heads it is a good idea to update these as well.

new power supply,i'm looking at buying a taz 4 locally for a good price. the only problem is it doesn't have the power supply. how could i go about getting one? or does anyone have a spare that they would like to sell.,i-t-w.com has them.
taz 6 jams unless very high temperature,"has anyone seen this?   i have a new taz 6 -- mostly i've been working with the dual extruder, but i switched it back to the included single extruder for some simpler prints.  the first few went fine using the default profiles, but then it started jamming unless i crank the temperature way up.   i had been printing abs.  just using the manual controls, i couldn't get it to even ooze until i go up to about 280, and even then it is irregular.  at 295 it started flowing more freely but then gives me the max temp error.

i switched to pla --- left it way high until i got all the abs out and pure pla was flowing, then let everything cool off.   starting again, at the recommended 205 - nothing.   i see it start to flow around 220-225 but not nice ""normal"" flow until about 240.    now i am printing with pla at 240 and everything seems fine.   what is going on?   bad temperature sensor?    any ideas?

thanks!!!

-john","i had jamming issues on the taz 6 that ended up being related to leveling and ultimately nozzle cleaning.  the nozzle wasn't cleaning completely which caused the extruder to press extra hard on the leveling washer during leveling which then caused the software to think that the bed was lower than it actually was so the first layer was extruded way to close to the bed.  the part would print fine, but then the extruder would be clogged if a second print was attempted.  in my case though adding extra heat didn't help.  i had to take the top of the extruder off (pinch roller, gears etc.) and manually clean the hot end.  doing cold pulls didn't work either.  i added extra cleaning code to fix my issue.  your problem however does sound like a temperature sensor problem.  if you have a thermocouple or laser temperature sensor, you could measure the hot end and see what the temp is."
taz 6 - weak bed adhesion compared to mini,"i've owned a mini for about a year and a half.   i just got a taz 6 a few months ago.   one thing i noticed right away is that the print surface adhesion isn't nearly as good on the taz 6 as it is on the mini.   with the mini, i need to almost pry parts off the plate when they are done, but with the taz the parts barely stick at all.   this is with abs and almost identical settings when slicing for each printer.

   is this a common issue with the taz 6, or did i just get a defecting print surface out of the box?  any other people seeing this issue?","moejt wrote:measuring bottom layer thickness it sounds like an exercise in futility (maybe i'm wrong, just my feelings on it). 

mainly i can tell bottom layer thickness (to low/to high)  just by watching the first layer print. i generally how for over sticking though as i print difficult parts. 

 i would just print a test cube on both machines and compare the bottoms. 

i have a theory that lulzbot has intentionally increased their z-height on the first layer on the taz 6 to avoid parts from sticking to much. it's no secret that the pei sheets have bubbling issues that is only exacerbated by parts sticking overly well. additionally i'd imagine a larger print bed on the 6 would be more prone to bubbling than the smaller minis pei sheet. solution? increase z-height so customers are less likely to damage the pei. 

i'm the first to admit this is just a conspiracy theory that has no evidence or facts to back it up. call it a gut feeling. 

your solution would be to change the firmware and lower the  nozzle. or you can try sanding the pei and try and increase your stick.

i can tell you that this is nowhere near the case. i got my taz 6 2 weeks ago and practically damaged the pei trying to get the rocktopus off. the skirt was a nightmare and i actually have a smooth groove in part of my pei sheet because the z offset in the printer was too low. i did not have the same post-""first print excitement"" with the taz 6 that i did with the mini. 

using the panel my z-offset was set to -1.350 by the person who prepped/calibrated my machine. after some experimenting i have it now set to -1.100 and things have improved immensely. 

what do your skirts look like before the print? are they really flat and almost see through?

if your cura initial layer setting height is .425 then stop a print after the initial layer and measure it. that is your first step."
abs fume extraction and temperature inside enclose?,"hi, 

i need to build an enclosure because it's too cold in my garage to print at the moment, i'm getting super bad splitting. i have a taz 3, i'm going to try and make a lightweight enclosure using some kind of lightweight frame with space blankets as the exterior walls. it will look like a nasa 3d printer haha. 

the question i have is, i kinda  want to vent abs fumes outside of the garage. i'm just curious though, for those that have say a hepa filter with an extraction fan, if you have a low ambient temperature, wouldn't the extraction of the fumes cause fresh cold air to come into the enclosure and ruin the prints..? or do you just extract the fumes once a print is finished?","my comment was more directed towards exhausting heat from the chamber. but that's cool, we can derail this thread.

all research just shows there are particles. yes. 

and that ""fumes maybe equal bad? but no actual evidence to back it up"". i've actually read through the articles with all of their technical white noise and lack of evidence for their conclusions. 

i'm a mechanical engineer by trade. i've toured many plastic injection molding plants. all of which have much stronger odor than anything my printer puts out. all of which are manned all day by workers for decades...  who show no health problems. all of which are not are not deemed to be a safety hazard by the government or osha. 

and it's not like the plastic industry is a new industry. factories and engineering love their regulations and safety standards (just look at the car industry, i love working on a project for gm.....  -_-)  i'd imagine if there was an issue someone would have jumped on it. 

if you want to be safe than sorry then more power to you.  i was actually agreeing with the filter in the chamber filtering air within the chamber. im actually planning to implement this in my chamber. because you know...  my original comment was actually about exhausting heat from the chamber.

and back to the original topic. air flow across your print can effect it, even warm air. so just make sure the filter isn't blowing directly on or near the print when recirculating the air."

lulzbot taz 5 filament extruding very slowly,"hello all,

i recently started working at my school's 3d printing lab with a lulzbot taz 5. not sure how well maintained it has been in the past since i'm new here. we've been having a pretty consistent problem with the taz where filament extrudes very very slowly, and only extrudes at a normal speed when it is being pushed down on. this happened with pla, and we replaced the hot end after which prints were working consistently. but when we replaced the pla filament after it ran out we had the problem again. just this morning we tried switching to abs (heated up to 220, extruded pla until we saw abs come out), and the abs is having the same issue.

does anyone have thoughts on how to fix this problem? i read some of the threads and i think it might be heat creep, but i'm not sure what i should do to target the issue. i attempted to perform a cold pull this morning before putting the abs filament in, but i either did it wrong or was not strong enough to actually pull the filament out.

thank you!

lylia","220 is way to low for abs. try 240. also check and verify the barrel fan is working, they can fail.

lulzbot taz 3 stops randomly,"printing connected via usb for cura lulzbot edition (latest) and windows 8.1. it just randomly stops... the printer still says ""printing.."" but it doesn't do anything. hot end and bed stay hot which causes the hot end to melt the print a bit. when i find it like this i try to cancel the print and raise the head. sometimes i can sometimes i have to restart cura. so i think it's maybe cura causing the issues? i'm going to try print from sd card tonight. 

just wonder if anyone else had similar strange issues printing over usb? should i try a different os? or different slicer?

questions for building an enclosure,"hey

i'm in the process of building an enclosure for my taz 4->5, partly based on one of the popular designs around here.

i see different information on the following points everywhere i go, so i'd appreciate if someone could help me out with this:

- is it safe to have the filament spools on the inside of the enclosure? i've heard some things about this causing pla to become brittle due to its low glass transition temperature, but i print in petg, abs, ninjaflex and nylon (never pla), all of which have higher gt temps, so would it be safe to do this with these filaments?
- the power supply will obviously be going outside, and the control box needs an air intake to keep it cool. is an air intake alone enough or is it also necessary to have an exhaust vent somewhere to keep temps in the whole enclosure down?
   - in addition to this, would the intake/exhaust work with filters to clean the air, allowing no harmful fumes/particles to exit, or would this reduce the airflow too much?
- is there some kind of smart way to let cables enter the box without them leaving an ""open"" hole in it? i want this thing to be as air tight as possible so i can filter the air.

thanks a lot!","nim wrote:- is it safe to have the filament spools on the inside of the enclosure? i've heard some things about this causing pla to become brittle due to its low glass transition temperature, but i print in petg, abs, ninjaflex and nylon (never pla), all of which have higher gt temps, so would it be safe to do this with these filaments?
i've never read definitive info that says you can't.  are you concerned with the look of having the spool on the outside or trying to figure out how to get guide it into the box?  this is my solution using jonathanb's stupendous design.  https://grabcad.com/library/hotbox-diy- ... printing-1  i actually much prefer having the filament drop straight down into the extruder and i've tried many different options.  and here's the great thread in this forum.  viewtopic.php?f=16&t=1659&hilit=hotbox  it's a must read.













nim wrote:- the power supply will obviously be going outside, and the control box needs an air intake to keep it cool. is an air intake alone enough or is it also necessary to have an exhaust vent somewhere to keep temps in the whole enclosure down?
i've printed for 7 months with only an intake for the control box and even though i built the intake and the exhaust ports from jonathan's design, i've never actually wired up the fans and used them.  in other words, it's definitely never been too hot in the box.  i print majority in abs but when i print with pla i just leave the door cracked so it doesn't get so hot.
nim wrote:- in addition to this, would the intake/exhaust work with filters to clean the air, allowing no harmful fumes/particles to exit, or would this reduce the airflow too much?
a filter would be just fine to use as long as it didn't restrict the airflow so much that it caused stress on the fan.  you'd have to be the judge of that.
nim wrote:- is there some kind of smart way to let cables enter the box without them leaving an ""open"" hole in it? i want this thing to be as air tight as possible so i can filter the air.
it's hard to explain but i actually bring my cables in from the floor of my enclosure.  the base of mine is a bit bigger than the file cabinet i have it sitting on and i'm just exploiting the fact that heat rises and won't escape from the opening in the bottom.  never caused me a problem.  but there are also a lot of these types of brushed openings you can get as well to keep the heat in and make an easy way to pass cables through.  https://www.google.com/search?q=brushed ... 9&bih=1207

prints come out lumpy,"hello folks,

i'm printing on a taz 5 standard setup with hexagon head. i have recently run into the problem that items i am printing are coming out lumpy and distorted. i'm not really sure how to describe it, so i've included pictures. the mystery here is that these exact parts, with the same material and settings, printed cleanly in the past. the only change i can think of is that a couple weeks ago i moved the printer from one desk to another desk right next to it (total distance moved ~5 feet.) i'm thinking this could have messed something up, but i've had clean prints since the move.

the material here is pla/pha, printing at 225/70. layer height .14, speed 50mm/s. there's no problems with bed adhesion. i've looked around for existing threads on this issue, but as i'm not really sure how to describe it, i'm not sure what to look for. i had wondered if it was a cooling issue. there's no enclosure on the printer, and if i leave a door open there can be a draft. but this was never a problem in the past, and i still get these issues if i close the doors and eliminate the draft.

any ideas?

update:
upon further examination, i can see that the problem is areas curling up during the print. when the print head passes over, it pushes them back down again, but then they curl back up. it's especially bad on areas with slight overhang, as they are thinner. no problems with adhesion to the bed though.









","thanks everyone. it is cooler the last couple of days, and my results have improved. however, i still can't get a clean print. i have tried:

- lowering print speed
- thinner and thicker layer heights
- abs
- with and without extra fans
- lowering head/bed temp

none of these seem to make any meaningful difference. i'm getting better results, but couldn't notice an improvement from any of these changes. the area that's still having trouble now is a ~20deg overhang. the layers curl up, and aren't sufficiently pushed down by subsequent layers."
tip to keep tip clean,"i am the proud owner of a mini and a taz 6. mini worked great out of the box, but the taz 6 was a bit out of square and the z-axis jammed and caused the printer to print out nylon completely encasing the hot end (below). i thought i would need to send it back, but i heated the hot end up and managed to free it from its nylon casing and was able to extrude filament. however the tip was covered in burned nylon and would fail on auto-leveling. i called lulzbot and they suggested non-metallic scotch brite and i scrubbed and scrubbed, but the auto-leveling was still inconsistent. then i hit on the solution, cut out a small circular piece of scotch brite and attach it to a dremel tool in place of one of the polishing pads and run in on low speed with the hot end heated up. viola! works like champ. i have examined the tip under a magnifier and cannot see any scratching. not sure if lulzbot support would officially support this, but low speed and just touching it a couple times will clear off all the grime.","after reading your experience with the non-metallic scotch brite, i got some at the grocery store (scotch brite heavy duty scrub sponge -- sponge on one face, scotch brite stuff on the other), cut off a half-inch-wide strip from one end (so it was about four inches long), and tried manually scrubbing the nozzle tip on my taz 5 with it when it was hot (235 c), before starting a print.

my nozzle had been pretty crudded up, and the scotch brite cleaned off all the bits and bumps of stuff nicely.  after each use i have to pick off the melted plastic (petg in this case), and can re-use the same piece 2-3 times before it gets too messed-up.  then i cut off another section from the sponge for next time.

i'd been concerned about the scotch brite melting onto the nozzle, but it doesn't seem to.

great idea about the scotch brite, thanks!"
modified taz speed trials - 40mm calibration cube,"anyone want to know about how fast my modified taz can print things at? me too. it turns out, if my math is right, it can go at least 400mm/s, faster if i figure out how to make it go faster than that. 

anyways, here's a long boring video showing it printing really fast 

","i haven't printed many things at that extremely high print speed because i didn't want to put very much wear and tear on the machine. if you would like to see a specific part printed at high speed, let me know and i can print it. at the higher speed pass on the cube, i was under extruding a bit because the hot end couldn't keep up, but there was no ringing or wobble present at all even at that speed. 

the modifications i have made to my printer that have had the most effect on improving surface quality at speed are the following, in this order: 
1.  the openbuilds x axis
2. the openbuilds y axis
3. the taller extruder mount (eliminates forward nozzleflex)
4. the reinforced extruder carriage (or the taz 6 carriage)
5. reinforcing the corners with this bracket: (http://i-t-w.com/parts/brackets-misumi- ... 5-aluminum) - stiffens the frame
6. the anti wobble modification
7. the aluminum bed plate to main frame connector pieces sourced from techsavvy34 in the forums here
8. the z axis openbuilds modification - does help, but it is a minimal amount (less than i was expecting actually) and the anti wobble has a similar effect

the openbuilds x and y make the most immediate and dramatic difference in printed part quality. the carriage modifications are incremental. the anti wobble can be pretty dramatic difference as well if your machine has wobble. if it does not have noticeable wobble, its less important than the other reinforcements. the corner frame reinforcement pieces are required for very high speed prints, as the frame will attempt to rack otherwise, but are less important for normal speed printing. 

the z axis doesn't hurt anything, but it doesn't help as much as i was expecting that it would. after giving it a lot of thought, i believe one of the biggest sources of offset in the x and y direction, which the z axis should constrain, is actually flex in the y bed rods.  as the belt moves the bed in and out, it tends to exert a small but noticeable offset force on one side or the other. the x axis, being on stacked rods has a similar but less noticeable kick up of the nozzle. since z moves much slower and less frequently, the cheapest effective modification there is likely going to be replacing the bushings with a more precise set, and maybe hardened rods. 

there are two other modifications that i also recommend strongly, that don't necessarily improve surface quality. the aluminum heated build plate to replace the glass plate allows for faster printing and much better abs part adhesion to the bed. the glass bed is heavy and doesn't spread heat as well as aluminum. the tricky part is finding a 12"" x 12"" aluminum plate that is 3/16"" thick and not warped in any way by cutting. 

the other modification i recommend is the z axis endstop micrometer target modification. if you aren't going to install auto leveling, it's the best way to maintain a highly precise z axis height 

for the heat set inserts, it is possible to order them from one of the manufacturers in germany. http://www.spirol.com appears to ship there. you want the series 14 tapered inserts, m3, and m5 (a couple m2 are also used but can be worked around.) their minimum order quantity is 150 inserts, and i have no idea what the cost is, but that might be an option. they are also called ultrasonic weld inserts, so they may just be under another name auf deutsch.

one option, if you cant find the actual inserts, would be to modify an ""acorn nut"" or one of those nuts with the dome on one end. if you carve some grooves in the surface of the nut to rough it up a bit, then insert it like a heat set insert, it may hold.

taz 6 toolhead wobble,"so i got my taz 6 assembled and ran it through a few test prints. when i was mounting the toolhead i tried my best to ensure that the bottom of the toolhead was seated firmly in the x axis carriage while tightening down the 2.5mm hex screw at the top, since i had seen in the review by 3dprintingnerd on youtube that there could be issues with the bottom of the toolhead being or becoming slightly loose.

i ran through the rocktopus test print and a 17g print of my own design, and then went back to check the toolhead only to find a disturbing amount of free play. i could lift the bottom of the toolhead away from the carriage in the y direction by about ~1mm with a moderate amount of force, and could wobble it back and forth in the x direction with a fairly light touch.

i loosened and retightened the 2.5mm hex screw, again taking care to apply downward pressure to the toolhead to ensure it seated firmly in the carriage. the toolhead now feels secure again, with only a slight amount of free play in the x direction, but i'm worried that this problem might come back as there's no positive retention of the tool head in the z direction to keep it from jacking upwards out of the carriage due to x axis forces (like from the nozzle cleaning cycle).

is there a torque specification for the 2.5mm toolhead retainer bolt? the head is pretty small so i feel like if i try to crank it down it's just going to sink into the plastic and chew things up.

has anyone devised workarounds for this issue? it seems like a piece of electrical tape placed on the bottom corner(s) of the toolhead might help prevent the toolhead from shifting in the x axis during cleaning, and prevent the head from jacking upwards?","i've never had an issue with it becoming loose once secured... when you slide the bottom of the tool head into the slot (v shaped thing) on the carriage can you slide it back and forth in the x axis direction (before you bolt it down)?

i recently printed my own upgrades (carriage, back plate, ect) and the actual v shaped portion that goes into the slot on the upgrade printed  was about 2mm short of the width needed. sure you bolt it down but it ends up not being secure and ends up acting more like a pendulum.

i figured i had 3 options.

1. reprint the entire carriage and rebuild the tool head (which i had just done for the upgrade). nope i was feeling lazy.

2. reprint the actual part that the tool head slots into, its just a small piece that bolts on with 4 screws to the back plate... my only concern was  future toolheads then not fitting after i modified the part.

3. ghetto rig it and build up the width with some other material. you mentioned electrical tape... i went with something more rigid. i mixed together spare filament and some acetone into a type of putty and then slathered it on. the beautiful part about it... is that once it dried a little bit i could push it down into the slot that it mounts to and it would create a perfectly formed fit. just be sure to pulled it out to let it finish drying so it would adhere to the carriage.

4. sure you could contact customer support... wait a week for them to ship it and then another week for it to actually be delivered. 

welcome to the world of taz, great printers that become even better once you start to tinkering."
do you want to remotely control power to your taz and peripherals?,"do the following:

1. get one of these (relay power strip): https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/b00wv ... utf8&psc=1

2. make one of these (octopi): http://octoprint.org/ (i suggest this for simplicity https://github.com/guysoft/octopi)

once you have octoprint up and running...

3. do this: https://github.com/foosel/octoprint/wik ... m-your-rpi

-. hardware and setup:
 - the relay only needs a gpio pin (3.3v) and a ground pin. i used board pins 7&9
 - install wiringpi (https://projects.drogon.net/raspberry-p ... d-install/)
 - edit the init.d/octoprint file as described under https://github.com/foosel/octoprint/wik ... topi-image
 - edit the config.yaml script under .octoprint and under the system section, add the two clocks of scipt; one for on, one for off

remember, there are two ways to refer to gpio pins; board, and bcm. board means the physical pin number, bcm means the port number. above, when adding the line to the init.d/octoprint file, the entry assumes bcn. so in this case, if you are using physical gpio pin 7, its bcm address is 4.

so what you have in the end is this:

init.d/octoprint:

gpio export 4 out (line 77, where export makes gpio available to octoprint, 4 sets the bcm pin number (pysical gpio pin 7), and ""out"" sets the gpio as outputing the state [1 or 0, on or off] )

retval=""$?"" (existing line)

your config. yaml looks like this:

system:
  actions:
  - action: printer on
    command: gpio -g write 7 1
    name: turn on the printer
  - action: printer off
    command: gpio -g write 7 0
    confirm: you are about to turn off the printer.
    name: turn off the printer

note: you can make the text in ""name"" and ""confirm"" anything you want.

so there ya go, what you get in the end is an install of ""wiringpi "", a pair of normally off and a pair of normally on plugs in a relay controlled power strip. two wires leading out the side that plug into your raspberry pi, and a couple of new commands in octoprint for turning stuff on and off.

agreed, this is a good solution, but much riskier for a layman. wit these relays, you must be absolutely confident that you are wiring it correctly and that you understand that you are dealing directly with mains voltage.

with the loggers solution, you are only controlling a power strip with 3.3 volts for all intent and purpose, and one with built in fail safes."
extrusion jam before the heated head (photos),"hi, (sorry for english, i'm french)

i have a pb with my extruder : i have often jam between the extruder part & the heated head.











my both fans (filament one + head one) are working.
the screws holding the nozzle are hard tighten
i use pla at 205°c
no other pb... it prints very well until the jam.

the extruder part seems not to have any pb. 
each time it's stuck i have to remove all to access to the filament (it's impossible to load or unload it.)
thx ","that could be heat creep. the heat from the hotend works its way up into the heatsink and softens the filament. pla seems to be the most prone to it, but it can happen with other types as well. i used this upgraded fan duct for the heatsink, it helps with that sort of issue. 

http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1461335

the look of the filament makes me wonder if you don't also have an alignment problem. is the filament path nice and straight?"
"lines in print, need help please!","i started getting these lines in my print, it started a couple days ago, i thought maybe it was simplify3d's settings, so i downloaded cura and printed this hollow cube to test it, as you can see i still get the lines. i am not sure what to do at this point and looking for some tips. my printer used to print pretty smooth and clean except for some zits or blobs, which i didn't mind so much, but these lines are driving me crazy. as you can see it only happens every so layers. please help me figure this out.
here is a hollow cube printed in the newest cura to date, on standard lulzbot profile (downloaded from the page)  this is a taz 5 as well. i have been using the same filament for over a year so i know it is not the filament.





","the banding is z-wobble... search the forums for ""solutions"".  the lead screws usually have a bend in them from manufacturing.  when in phase the banding can be exacerbated.

you can try to give one of the lead screws an eighth to quarter turn while the machine is powered off.  this could lessen the banding effect.  

make sure the lead screws have a good coating of white lithium grease...

fwiw, i think the banding starts to go away as the parts start to wear down... not sure if its the thread in the gantry or the lead screws."
taz 5 auto leveling,"hello everyone.  i am new to this forum and also fairly new to the world of 3d printing.
i've searched all over the internet and could not find one post regarding auto bed leveling on the taz 5 so i've decided to make this topic be my first post.

fyi: i will be providing videos and information that i did not develop myself.  i did however modify a little bit of the gcode to work with my printer.

all the latest versions of the marlin firmware has an auto-leveling section within so, you will need to edit the firmware for the taz 5, you do not / should not use firmware that was made and posted to be used with the taz 3 or 4.

assuming that you've already printed and assembled the probe parts from here:
http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:117957/#instructions
all you need is the hardware from this one link. you do not need the (anti-backlash z-nut and motor to m6 mount mod) or the (lulzbot taz stiffened x motor and bearing mounts)
i had to do a little sanding in order to get my probe to retract without hitting the x axis motor.
this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnqr_fqxrys has instructions on installing parts.

you can buy the heat set inserts from mcmaster carr http://www.mcmaster.com/#94180a331/=wzgqi5
and i recommend ebay as the cheapest place if you want to get / install the (optional) 10mm lm10uu linear bearing 

step 1: download your latest firmware from https://www.lulzbot.com/support/downloads
step 2: download and install the latest version of arduino ide http://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software
step 3: visit https://ohai-kit.alephobjects.com/proje ... -flashing/ on instructions for installing and loading your firmware in arduino ide
step 4: watch these videos:  they are for a makerfarm prusa i3, but everything within the video except for the servo setup (which you can skip) is the same.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mslor_efkc
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypiosetkirg
step 5: develop your gcode:  it may take some time to get it fine tuned, but this is what i have so far.
i call this my work in progress as it may require some tweaking.
code: select allg21 ; set units to millimeters
m107
g28 ; home all axes
g1 z5 f5000 ; lift nozzle <----
m203 x192 y208 z4 ; set max rapid rates mm per sec
g91; set to incremental motion
g1 z5.0 f11520; raise z
g90; set to absolute motion
g28 x0 y0; home x and y axes
g1 x276 f11520; go to probe deployment position
g1 x288 f350; deploy probe
g1 x138 y62 f11520; go to probing spot
g28 z0; home z axes
g29; probe bed
g1 z4.0 f11520; raise probe off bed
g1 x-10 f11520; go to probe retract position
g1 x-28 f350; retract probe
g1 x1 f350; move away from limit switch
g92 x28 y98 z4.2; set actual location

and that's pretty much all i have so far.  please comment and tell me what you think.

edit: removed part of the gcode: m206 x0.0 y0.0 z0; offset home position for fine tuning
reason: m206 doesn't seem to be working with me so i use g92 instead.","great work! i used this guide this weekend.
im wondering how to you calibration your g92 funtion?

ive currently got:
code: select allg92 x0.0 y98 z15.7

how did you figure out the x and y offset?
having x0 & y98 offset works for me but im not sure if its right for my machine, how did you figure this out?"
new couplers,"i tried to install vibration dampers on my z motors today and i found my cpx16-5-5 couplers were not big enough to span the gap. can anyone suggest another size that fits? i have a taz 2 turned into a 4..

thanks!:)","you really don't need the vibration dampers on z, it doesn't move enough to make enough noise to benefit. if you really want to add them though, you will need a coupler that matches the following dimensions

5mm inner diameter (top and bottom, 16mm outer diameter (ish), at least 26mm long in your case.  model 2463k22 from mcmaster carr should work http://www.mcmaster.com/#standard-shaft ... s/=12upl0e 

for me, i would probably pull the dampers off there before spending $80 on couplers."
odd part shrinkage,"i had a part order this week from 3d hubs.  not the way i'd design the parts, but i didn't think it would be much trouble.  however, i get severe warp at the point that the inner wall and the support end meets.  i ended up raising the entire part off the build platform by 12mm, and it printed mostly ok, but this was a surprise to me.  this is in abs.  petg also did the same thing.  the only material not showing this warp/shrink is ngen.","using simplify 3d.  when i print in ngen, comes out perfect.  not the same gcode of course because my settings are different for ngen and abs, but it's the same source file.  when i raise it off the bed by 12mm, it printed fine.  i'll see if i can see something in the gcode.

oh and in the preview mode of the slicer, it looks fine.  attached screengrab"
finest layer setting for taz 5,"i have been merrily printing, and ran into a bunch of issues, which end resulted in a bunch of wasted filament, but learning a bit more about the right tension and a ton about 3d software trying to fix a model.

i know the recommended 'fine' profile sets layers at .14mm, but wondering if anyone's gone lower successfully and if it's worth it. 

thanks,

ted","i wrote a little bit about low layer printing here. you need to calibrate your z- offset (thumscrew for z endstop) very precisely or your first layer will fail. or you print the first layer much thicker than the rest.
usualy, things get a little bit more complicated at 0.1mm. everything beyond that i would call experimental. it's possible, but you may need to fine tune some settings to get some prints and you will find out completely new limitations and problems  

edit: one thing i wasn't mentioning in the linked thread is the extruder resolution. one step of the extruder stepper results in a fixed amount of extruded filament. if you print very lwo layers, you can see the ""pulses"" when the stepper is doing a step.."
bulk wiper pad?,does anyone know where to get wiper pad material in bulk?,"the felt we use we get from mcmastercarr, part number: 88085k311 after we get these in, we soak either side of the felt pad in an abs and acetone solution. this helps prevent the ""fuzzies"" from sticking to the nozzle after the wiping process."
layers over support material look terrible,"i am printing with the taz 6 with the dual extruder v2.
the attached picture describes the problem better than i can.  the surfaces in that picture were printed down towards the bed and were resting on hips support material.  the black material is abs.
the other side of the part looks fine, but every time i try to print on support material it looks like this.  
often when i have holes in the part like this one there are lots of strings across it as well.  i cleaned them off of this part.
the support structure setting i used in cura 19.12 were the defaults i think.  
structure type: lines
overhang angle:  45 deg.
fill amount: 30%
distance x/y mm:  0.7
distance z mm:  0.05

i printed at 50mm/s, 240c temp on both nozzles, and 110c on the bed, 0.2 mm layer height, 1mm shell thickness, 50% fill.

i spent a lot of time dialing in the alignment of the two extruders during the setup for the dual head printer, and they are equidistant from the bed.
what settings can i change to get this to stop?","unfortunately that is one of the draw backs to fdm printing. the area your support touches won't ever look particularly good. 

you've upped the support infill to 30 percent which i find helps. i've not messed with dual extruder but i've always wondered what would happen if you went with very high infill for the support when the support is solvable (just a random thought) 

 the only other thing i have found that helps. is to lower your z distance between the support and the print.  there is a trade off though. your surface will improve in some ways but your support will not easily be removed. in fact some might stay behind thus requiring more post processing. it all depends on what youre wanting.

in general i try to design my parts to avoid support structure just for this reason. 

maybe others have had more success than me and can weight in."
taz 6 - mandatory bed leveling?,i'd like to save time by not probing every print. is there an option or workflow to remember bed leveling details for next print?,"caylan wrote:i'd like to save time by not probing every print. is there an option or workflow to remember bed leveling details for next print?

i'm interested to see the responses that people post regarding this question. 

but from what i've seen i don't think there really is. you can manually edit your g-code to remove the bed leveling if you want (but i would make sure to still home it every time). i've played around with trying that on few that i was impatient to wait for the bed leveling sequence on my mini when i was testing things. but there have been a few times the distance has changed by a few millimeters, enough that when the print starts it is suddenly slightly too close or slightly too far away from the bed that the first layer does not stick or even extrude. in those cases i've had to cancel the print and try again, so in all honesty the bed leveling sequence is probably more helpful than it may first appear. you could experiment with changing the speed that it homes at if you so wish though in an attempt to speed it up (something i have also tried). but again that's all up to how much risk your willing to do and live with. if something goes wrong suddenly your printer is moving at a much faster speed than before.

i want to say that the probing itself can be reduced from the ""fast touch and the slow touch"" routine by changing the g29 command to g30 which should only touch it once instead, but i'm not sure. if that is true and works that is another potential way to speed up your bed probing.

here are a few topics that were created around the same question, but for the mini. i think there are more, but these are the first two i found.

improving the flexydually cleaning and leveling,"warning!!!! do not use the g-code included in this post unless you have modified your cleaning pad frame and cleaning pad as shown in this post!!!!  if you use the g-code below with a stock taz 6 cleaning pad frame, you will smash the extruder nozzle into the stock cleaning pad frame. 
have you experienced leveling problems with the taz 6 and the flexydually?   note: this may apply to any lulzbot dual extruder, but i haven't tested it, so use at your own risk.  below are the checks and modifications i made to my taz 6 to improve the nozzle cleaning when using a flexydually.  prior to making these changes i experienced significant fluxuations in leveling numbers, espesically on the first leveling washer and i also experienced numerous extruder cloggs.  the clogging was due to incorrect leveling which was causing my first layer to be too thin.  this then caused exessively high extrusion pressure within the extruder.

there are several important aspects required in order to obtain good auto leveling numbers with the taz 6.  
1) your frame must be square.  to check your frame, follow the lulzbot instructions here:
https://ohai.lulzbot.com/project/squaring-taz-6-frame/

2) your x-axis must be true to the frame.  this is also covered at the end of the lulzbot instructions located here:
https://ohai.lulzbot.com/project/squaring-taz-6-frame/

3) the brass inserts that the bed frame screws into (the thumb screws that you tightened during assembly) must not be pulled out from the plastic parts on the frame.  to check this you must remove the thumb screws, nplug the y-axis motor, unplug the bed harnesses and remove the bed.  then you can inspect the brass inserts.  they should be flush with the plastic mounts, or below the surface.  if they are sticking out of the plastic mounts (i.e. above the surface), then it is time to contact lulzbot support.

4) your electrical connections must be good.  i found that on my flexydually, the wire that connects to the rear extruder nozzle head (the one that is part of the auto leveling circuit) was improperly crimped to the ring connector and the wire was loose.  i found the loose connection while troubleshooting poor leveling with the flexydually only (my machine leveled fine with the stock extruder).  i was able to recrimp the wire onto the loop connector located at the nozzle head (there was enough crimp length still left on the connector).  if you are experiencing erratic leveling then this may be an issue for you.  btw: lulzbot support did offer to repair my flexydually, but once i found the problem, it wasn't hard to repair myself.

5)only the rear extruder nozzle needs to be cleaned for auto leveling.  in fact, having the front nozzle touch the cleaning pad reduces the pressure that the rear nozzle puts onto the cleaning pad which is not a good thing.

6) auto cleaning of the flexydually can be improved by enlarging the cleaning pad area.

7) the amount of cleaning time can be extended by modifying the g-code.

lets look at on #6, a large cleaning pad area:
to enlarge the cleaning pad area i drew a new cleaning pad frame which can be downloaded from thingiverse:  http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1628978

this frame requires additional cleaning pad and it requires the bottom of the end of the cleaning pad to be trimmed a litte so that the pad doesn't stick out due to the screws being located under the ends of the pad.

now let's look at #5, getting only the rear nozzle to touch the cleaning pad:
the cleaning pad should be trimmed so that only the rear extruder touches the cleaning pad during the auto cleaning cycle.  this is how i trimmed my pad sections so that the front extruder does not touch anything during the cleaning cycle.  you'll notice that i left a little piece of pad that is at normal height near the auto leveling washer.  the rear nozzle does final wiping on this piece of pad with my modified g-code that is shown below.  the front section that is at normal height is 2 inches long.  the recessed part where the front nozzle will be located during cleaning (but not touching anything), is 2 inches long.  the final wipe area with the g-code below is located next to the auto leveling washer and is 5/8 inches long.  you should be able to use one of the extra cleaning pads included with the taz 6 to make the additional cleaning pad section required for this modification.



finally lets look at #7:
i modified the g-code in a few key ways.
	1) the cleaning temperature was increased from 170 to 175.
	2) the retraction amount was decreased becuase i experienced problems where my filament would retract too far and become ejected from the extruder pinch roller during the cleaning operation when performing a second print because the filament is retracted a little at the end of every print and the sum of the end print retraction and the cleaning retraction amount was too much.
	3) the cleaning g-code was significantly modified and is only to be used with the new cleaning pad and cleaning pad frame that was discussed above.  once you have assembled your new and longer cleaninng pad frame and pad, you can replace the exising start2.gcode with the g-code shown below.  first delete the stock start2.gcode. the g-code below can then be copied and pasted into the start2.gode location.

warning!!!! do not use the g-code included in this post unless you have modified your cleaning pad frame and cleaning pad as shown in this post!!!!  if you use the g-code below with a stock taz 6 cleaning pad frame, you will smash the extruder nozzle into the stock cleaning pad frame. 

also, use this mod on a single extruder at your own risk.  i have not tested it on a single extruder setup.
important note!!!:  if you copy the beginer setting to the expert settings, this may erase (replace) the modified start2.gcode with the factory start2.gcode.  you will then need to re-copy and paste the g-code below into your start2.gcode.
well, i hope these items can help others who are experiencing irregular auto leveling numbers with the flexydually.
below is the new g-code that cleans the rear nozzle on the flexydually more thoroughly with the extended wiper pad.  use at your own risk!!!

taz 5 dual extruder head calibration squares problem?,"hey guys. new to the forum. just got my taz 5 with dual extruder head. i've been following the setup instructions and i'm at the calibration section. when i go to print the calibration squares i would expect to see what the instructions depict:

but instead i am printing this:

http://imgur.com/m13ja3n

where am i going wrong? is this a software setting i've missed?","not to hijack, but since the op answer is resolved, can i ask --> is anyone having problems with 2 color prints clogging?
we routinely get this:


the small frog printed fine. i am thinking the long idle time between layers is making one nozzle clog. is there any fix?

a new fan shroud, or maybe some sort of firmware / gcode tweak to keep fans on more often?

thanks."
y-axis will jams rotating clockwise,"morning guys i awoke today to hear a horrendous grinding mid print, my y-axis motor is jamming when turning clockwise the carriage is entirely free to move but the motor is jamming in the clockwise rotation the printer will now no-longer home even with the motors disabled and the printer entirely off the stepper will not freely rotate

anyone had anything similar ?","even with the belt removed and no weight on the stepper it still will not rotate? sounds like a bad stepper ($15~20). thankfully that is the easiest one to replace (about a 5 minute job, the longest part of it is re-tightening the belts.)"
taz 5 abs cracking even with cat guard. next steps?,"i've been having issues with abs cracking on large prints. i've built a cat guard that seems to be helping some but i'm still not getting the desired result. the picture attached shows the issue. i'm printing fairly slowly at 75% infill. should i turn off my extruder fans and try again? this print has taken almost 2 days to reach this point (using the abs fine profile from the lulzbot site) with a 0.35 mm nozzle so i'd rather not start over without a solid guess on a fix. i was considering piercet's open rail build as my next mod to see if that will help. 

also, would i be safe cranking up the speed/acceleration or should i stick with stock settings? 

thanks for any suggestions. 




","jim2386 wrote:steps that fixed it for me

1. build an enclosure (which you've done)

2. turn off your part cooling fan. if the part is larger, you don't need it.

3. bump the nozzle temperature up to 250c (assuming you're using lulzbot abs)

4. print with a brim to hold it to the bed better.

on huuuuuge parts you're still get some splitting depending on the shape of the object, but turning off the fan and turning up the nozzle temperature minimized it. the minor splits can be fixed by making abs glue/slurry and a little sanding.

jim

i'm using ic3d abs which normally prints great at 230 so i bumped it up to 240. i'm running this latest attempt with no fans so we'll see how that goes. as far as bed adhesion, i've found that light scrubbing with some rubbing alcohol and a magic eraser pad between prints actually works wonders. since doing that, i've experienced no curling from the bed and i think (haven't independently verified/anecdotal) that it has reduced the size of some of the larger air bubbles under my pei sheet."
lm10uu bearings,"this is for anyone that has upgraded their taz with hardened rails and bearings...

what bearings did you purchase and where did you source them? do they run nice and smooth for you? how do you oil / grease them?

i went with misumi bearings and rails and have found the bearings, especially on the y axis to run a little rough. the roughness translates to a stippling or texturing on the side wall of my parts when the y axis is moving. 

i am going on the assumption that this is caused by a bearing problem. if anyone has other ideas, i would love to hear them.

it is difficult to get a good picture of this but here are a couple of examples. you can see the problem more clearly if you view the full size image.





x axis is nice and smooth as it should be.





y axis has this odd textured look.","just to update this.

i have moved back to the igus bearings on y due to the continued roughness generated when the metal bearings were installed.

i have tried three different sets of bearings. amazon whatevers, misumi and vxb. all were rough on y. i have also tried light machine oil, superlube aerosol, superlube grease and the lucas lithium grease lulzbot recommends for the lead screws. the lubes didn't change anything."
replacement controller - fried z driver,"hey all, so i'm the unlucky guy who's heatsink fell off and it managed to touch something it shouldn't have frying the z stepper driver. so now i'm in the market for a new controller. i've done a decent level of research into boards, firmware, etc and have come down to two choices and was hoping to get some input before pulling the trigger:

1. buy replacement rambo. this is the obvious first choice, it's a simple drop in replacement, load the same firmware, and off i go printing the same quality as i have before. the downsides i'm currently weighing against it is that compared to similar feature set boards it's more expensive. it's also a fully integrated board, which as above if a driver fails, i have to replace the entire thing. something i've never been fond and why i have never purchased an all-in-one pc either (laptops included).

2. buy an azteeg x3 w/ sd8825 stepper drivers. the highlights of this choice are the modular design making catastrophic failures like above easier to manage. capable of higher 1/32 microstepping (ymmv on if this matters). cheaper by far as the total cost would run almost $100 less than option 1. the downside would be getting the lcd on the taz 5 working with this board. it's definitely doable but would take some firmware hacking and a bit of rewiring to get it up and running (90% confidence that i could do this in a weekend).

so anyone care to chime in?","dang, solid point. i could have sworn it had 2 power inputs. i know the pro version has 3, so maybe i just got confused.

edit: it appears that it does include a secondary power input that is dedicated for the stepper motors: http://files.panucatt.com/datasheets/x3_v2_wiring.pdf 
i do have to wonder though it that secondary power input will work with what the taz power supply is pushing, it looks a bit small."
taz 3 - suddenly stopped working,"my taz 3 has suddenly stopped working. i was getting ready for a print and extruding some filament to get rid of the hips in the nozzle as i was going to be using pla. 

i heard a sudden click noise and the controller screen went blank (though the blue backlight was still on). 

when i turn the taz on, the extruder fan runs (i have upgraded it with a hexagon hot end), but i can't connect over usb and the controller screen stays a solid blue with no text. 

i've checked all 3 fuses and they are ok. 

any ideas? did i kill my rambo board by simply extruding filament?!!!","a pop on a rambo board would most likely be a capacitor, or a mosfet. either way you should see a physical sign of damage, or possibly a missing component. you also might be covered under the ultimachine rambo warranty even if the taz one has expired. e-mail them with the board serial number and you might be in luck."
improving small sphere quality,"modeled a few chess pieces in openscad and printing with cura.   using only one of the extruders of the flexy dual extruder and printing in abs.  layer height is 0.15mm, 20% infill, 235 temp and 90 bed.   the quality of the print overall is great.  but the top sphere keeps coming out crappy and not sure what to do about it.  

any suggestions?","hard to explain, but basically its due to the small surface area of the object.  the printed area is not cooling enough before the next layer is being deposited.  

there may be a setting cura, but its not my normal slicer... maybe another community member can tell you how to add the delay.  the other thing you could try is increasing the cooling through the ""tweak at z"" plugin... i guess you could also use the plugin to slow the print down at the top.

if you don't mind a bit of filament waste, you could try printing a pillar of the same height next to the chess piece.  a 5x5mm square pillar should work (and hopefully stay stuck to the bed).  essentially, printing the pillar layer and the toolhead movement time will allow the chess piece layer to set.

try the tweak at z plugin and slow down the print towards the top.  then try the pillar... 

hope that helps."
layer banding - z axis issue or x axis?,"hi all,

i have a taz v1 that's happily printing along, but one issue it has had since the beginning is that layers always make these little bands that you can feel.  this happens with abs and pla.  the banding pretty much mirrors the z-axis drive screw grooves, so i'm assuming changing the z-axis is pulling and pushing the x carriage just a tiny bit each time.  does that sound right given the attached image?

any suggestions on to to fix this?  i do want to upgrade to the better z-axis drive system of the taz 4 eventually, but i know my taz v1 can definitely do better until i get around to that upgrade.

- adam","mep11 wrote:have you tried a different slicer cause i found that kisslicer is really good for ""show"" prints. no z banding but when i use cura it comes back. it can also be cause of vibrations in your frame or the table you have it on. try putting a stiff rubber on the feet of the printer. i also heard on of the best upgrades you can do for tazs is putting a rubber garment between the stepper motors and the motor mount.

does flexystruder work with all filaments?,"i'm considering ordering a flexystruder, but i don't quite understand.. is it only intended for use with flexible materials, or is it able to work with both flexible and normal filament? 

i kinda trashed my extruder, and since all the relevant parts are out of stock, and i'm desperate to resume printing, i'm considering shelling out for a flexystruder. but i need to be able to print with n-gen. can i do that with a flexystruder? i would like to order a new extruder tool head (mine got covered with burnt plastic, and now when i try to load filament, i see wisps of smoke, and the plastic doesn't stick to the bed. to have confidence with my prints going forward, i would like to replace it.

brad","the flexy is designed for flexible filament only. whats wrong with current extruder? they are easily fixable. ive repaired a few before. you can also try itworks3d for used and new extruders, and parts also to repair. https://itworks3d.com/product/lulzbot-t. you can print any filament with the flexystruder, but it was designed to print softer filaments.  the difference is the lack of idler which applies pressure to the filament so the hobbed bolt can grip it.  the flexystruder uses a ptfe tubing to maintain a more constant path from the top of the extruder to the hot end."
extruder jams on larger prints and other problems,"after remedying what appear to be common taz problems ( x and y axis belts coming off bearings, leaky nozzle with pla), i'm left with a few persistent issues.

these appear to be unsolvable and i can probably live with:
-after using teflon on the nozzle threads pla pools on top of the heater block
-i'm printing pla on bare glass cleaned with rubbing alcohol and set to 60c. when i print towards the edges i get medium to poor adhesion; guessing this is due to inconsistent heat bed.

the issue i need solved:
-using the draft and high quality settings the nozzle begins to clog and ruins the print

the warning signs begin with shorter movements that have missing lines, this then extends to areas with longer movements, followed by no extrusion. i've tried pausing the print to clean the hobbed bolt, but it quickly becomes clogged again. initially, tightening the screws bought me more time but i still couldn't make it through a print much bigger than an octopus.

also, as the print progresses the nozzle sometimes brushes the previous layer and drags.

i've read about pla expanding over course of a print so i tried turning the bed off after the first layer without success, also i've read about possible z step inaccuracies, but shouldn't this be already calibrated by lulzbot? this is my first printer and expected a steep learning curve, however i did not expect so many hardware problems at this price point.

other details: printing white pla from lulzbot at 190c, first layer at 195c, bed at 60, calibration print looks great (evenly smooshed), using draft and hq config files from lulzbot (only changed the filament dia from 2.89 to 2.87 after measuring with dig. calipers) printing in a cool, 65f, humid room.

at this point i would like to just get through a print other than an octopus at any resolution, any tips would be greatly appreciated.","i've been having a similar issue with abs.  after about 2 hours into a print the extruder jams.  i've been reading a lot regarding ideas to correct.  my dabbling with this problem seems to support the ""heat creep"" idea of the material getting exposed to heat prior to entering the heat chamber.  as the knurled bolt pushes more material it bunches up the soft plastic and eventually causes a block.  as others, i've experimented with providing extra cooling to the heatsink on my extruder.  my issue has been how to push ventilation air through the heatsink.  i've looked at the ideas of placing fans and directing the flow of air through the fins.  this i find is too much work (havimg to design a holder for the fan) - not to mention the extra weight on the hot end assembly.

here's my last try.  instead of the complication of hanging a fan near the heatsinks, i've chosen to direct air through a silicone hose (about 5mm id).  this hose is nothing more than silicone aquarium air hose.  i drive air through a cheap aquarium pump.  see attached pics on how the hose attaches to the hot end.  the air pump is rated at about 5l of air per minute. seems to be enough to cool heatsink without affrecting the actual print.  i've chosen to direct the air to the lower part of the heatsink.  total cost less than $20.  total install time -less than 10 minutes.....

 so far, results have been promising... no jams...  i'll keep my fingers crossed."
catastrophic failure,"last night i start a print and, when i get up this morning to check on it, i find this...






the bed, during the print, shifted way off, the nozzle burned into the pei sheet, the main body of the print head snapped at the screws where the extruder mounts, and the  screen shows mintemp error so the thermistor line has probably broken. but that's not the strangest thing. upon closer inspection, i see this.






it looks like, somehow, the heater block had started to come unscrewed. so here's my question. do i pull out my spare parts and put it all back together, resolder the thermistor line, and rescrew the heater block back on... or is there something else that could have caused this that would cause me to want to buy a new hot end? i've put a few hundred hours on this printer since i upgraded to the olive/6 body parts so having it just completely fall apart like this is a little unexpected.","i think the root cause of this isn't the hotend. maybe the z-stepper (driver) failed, and after laying down some layers at same z height it blocked itself, leading to the x-y shift. next question would be, how is it possible that the nozzle touched the bed after it was already some mm above it..

i would:
.) have a close look at the gcode file, searching for strange movements.
.) test x,y,z axis free movement.
.) do a dry run of the code until a point after the failure."

new to the forum and lulzbot. just got a taz 6. i was able to print the rocktopus, but when i attempt prints of my own, the z-axis stop moving upward at some point. it continues to print layers and move on the x & y and comes to my attention when i hear the nozzle grinding against the print. maybe a software issue? thought i'd start here.

however, i can not square it.  sure, i followed the instructions to loosen the 4 bolts, slid / aligned the rails and brackets to be flush and square, tightened.  but when you measure the diagonal in both directions, it is off by an easy 3/8"".   did both sides.  i played with re-aligning multiple times, even using a metal angle bracket to make sure everything is square.   but when i measure the diagonals, always off by 3/8"".   i have no idea what is wrong, be it incorrect metal rail lengths, or maybe the assemblers didn't flush the rails into the other brackets, but it is impossible for me to square this up.

difficulties with prime tower/ooze shield failures,"i recently started working with a v2 dual extruder using innova-1800 and esun natural pva. my hope is to use pva in 2nd(front) extruder as support for my models. i am using one or both the prime tower or the ooze shield when extruders switch. i am growing frustrated that i have not had one of the features successfully build beyond the very early layers of the model. the issue with both is they come free from the bed. the prime tower specifically has an issue because the first layer is pva and it rarely extrudes material immediately creating partial layer and leaving little or nothing for next layer to build on. excess material begins to build up on hot end getting wiped off by edge of model. i run the innova at 240c and the pva i have tried at 210, 200, and 190, the bed i am running at 70c. i am using glue stick. my thought is what would code look like so wipe tower starts with the model material? possibly, enter sequence in start/end sequence gcode tab. i am no expert with code but i need to try something it stinks to wipe out my models because the features fail. 

-on a separate note is anyone using scaffold support material from e3d? successful settings for temps, etc. it hasn't run well yet for me mainly adhesion to the bed and to the innova-1800.","check the print setting recommendations for the pva on lb's product page (expand the parts & specifications section for extrusion temp range and bed treatment):
https://www.lulzbot.com/store/filament/natural-pva
check the inova-1800 product page also while you're at it.  

you're at the high side of the extrusion temp for pva.  the recommendation is to print pva on blue painters tape, this may work for the inova-1800 though they recommend glue stick... which by the way is pva.  so if you're printing the pva on the glue stick coating... that may be the problem."
taz hexagon thermistor soldered,"i had to take my hotend off to replace the nozzle and a wire came off the thermistor. at first i figured i broke the solid wire coming off the thermistor even though i was being careful but i pulled back the heat shield sleeve and found it came unsoldered and the 2 were just overlapped and soldered together with no physical connection.

i found this odd as the buda always had physical crimp connectors, at minimum they could have loop and twisted the 2 together before soldering but they just laid them side by side and soldered. not a good physical connection. i was in a hurry and just re soldered it but next time i need to take it apart i plan on fixing this properly.

just thought i would mention it.

help with base layer,"hi all, hope this is the right place to post this.  5 days in with my new taz 6.  still getting the hang of 3d printing.  some of my prints have been great; some have been disappointing.

the base layer of recent parts has been poor, almost like guitar strings.  see the attachment (the bottom of the part).  






the part was created in autodesk inventor, exported in .stl in fine format.  this particular part was printing in the current cura/lulzbot in high-speed format.  240 extruder temp, 110 bed temp (i think).  printing on a new 1kg spool of hatchbox black abs i bought from amazon.  no support or brim, but this is just a flat surface against the plate before i cancelled it.

---------------

could someone point me to the most likely thing to change, to diagnose and make better parts?

thanks all!","if this is new, and you used the same filament as before... could be an auto leveling fail, though usually that puts you too close to the bed. heat the nozzle to print temps and wipe it down with a scotchbrite pad. that helps clean things up to prevent that issue. if you've used pla, it can make this worse, or so i'm led to believe. maybe hit the washers with the pad as well. 

try measuring the diameter with a micrometer and enter that in the slicer settings. it could be slightly off from the current setting. 

to move closer to the bed for the first layer, adjust the z-offset in the machine settings (assuming cura). use a small negative amount, -0.2 or so. watch to make sure you don't get so close you gouge the pei. if it looks like you're getting too close, kill the machine power and try less offset. 

that pic shows more than the first layer, if you keep having problems, try printing just the first layer and show us a pic on the bed. that can help narrow things down. 

as you're new to 3d printing, make sure you do the testing with known good designs. it's pretty easy to have something be a little off in the design that makes it basically impossible to print."
taz 5: z-wobble fix,"hey 3d printing folks,

i wanted to share my experiences with z-wobble on the taz 5 with you, what the cause is, and how to fix it. i am dutch, so i will try my best to explain it in english. i experienced major z-wobble on my taz from the beginning. it was really annoying since i also have 3 ultimakers which don't have this problem at all. but as i have an education in mechanical engineering, i found a solution to this. 

at first i checked what the pattern of the z-wobble was by printing tall cilinder shaped objects. i found out the wobble was not really a wavy pattern that happens to certain layers, but the pattern was a spiraling effect. i found out the pitch of this spiraling effect was identical to the pitch of the threaded rods. so this got me thinking...

as you may know, the taz 5 has two threaded rods which move the x-carriage up and down. the threaded rods are the cause of the z-wobble, and here's why: 
threaded rods do always have a slight bend, this can of course be unnoticeable when this bend is very little. but some rods are bended more than others. another thing is, the threaded rods in te taz 5 are fixed with two ball bearings each, on the very top of the machine and on the bottom, close to the stepper motor. those ball bearings fix the movement from the rods in x and y dimensions. but this causes problems to the x-carriage. remember that the threaded rods are bended, when the stepper motors and rods start turning around, this bend also starts to turn around, like a jumping rope on its side. 
because the threaded rods are fixed in x and y directions, those bends start to apply forces on the x-carriage. so the whole x-carriage starts to move. and this is why the z-wobble happens. the direction of the force rotates with the threaded rod, so the z-wobble effect also rotates which causes the spiral effect.

the fix:
since the threaded rods don't have to be constrained in x and y direction, you can safely remove all 4 ball bearings on top and bottom. the threaded rods only have to fix (and move by rotating) the x-carriage in z direction. the x-carriage itself is already fixed in x an y directions with the smooth z-rods and linear bushings. as you remove those ball bearings, the threaded rods are able to move a tiny bit in x and y directions which compensates the bend of the threaded rods. the flexible couplings that connects the stepper motors with the threaded rods also allows them to move slightly. because the threaded rods are now allowed to move a little bit, they won't apply forces on the x-carriage anymore, and the z-wobble disappears. 

i also switched the linear bushings for linear bearings (lm10uu) since the bushings had way to much play. this also made the prints look even better. 

long story short: if you have a taz5 (or maybe an older version?), you can easily fix the z-wobble by removing all 4 ball bearings on top and bottom of the threaded rods. 

cheers,
sven van dam
@umakeprinting","that is one way of addressing z wobble. it leads to other inaccuracies though, especially at the far ends of the print. the taz used to use that exact setup actually.  the problem with an unconstraiend far end is that the tube ends up acting as a rod height setting member so you can end up with a variable z layer height by a few tenths of a milimeter. you can minimize that by putting the leadscrew directly on the motor, or resting on a metal ball but that still doesn't address the issues of z layer variability at the far end of the leadscrew due to shift arc. the best way to implement a leadscrew is the fixed / floating approach with an anti wobble device if necessary."

printing hard plastic in a flexistuder,"hi folks!
i've got a taz 5 with a flexy-dually v2 head, and a use-case for dual color abs prints.

previous experience with the default tool head shows the taz can use 1.75mm filament and get good results, so long as cura is told the filament size and the print is less than ~8 hours (after that it tends to clog for some reason).

my understanding is that one shouldn't use hard filament in a flexy-struder because friction of the filament against the extended ptfe feeding tube will damage the tube, and replacing it is difficult.

does this mean that it's safe to print hard plastic through the flexy-struder, so long as it's 1.75mm filament?  after all, the smaller filament diameter should mean there's no appreciable friction against the ptfe tube...

thanks and best regards,

  - ken","the fillament acts as a rope saw. basically the small area it is still in contact, you are going to get a notch worn into the side. a 1.75mm wide notch instead of a 2.85mm. the tube stuff isn't expensive and it's not particularily hard to install if you have the right drills for it and a drillpress, so i wouldn't worry about it too much personally, but if you don't know the tube installation process it can be a pain. the v1 and v2 assembly are pretty much the same, so this guide will show the process https://ohai.lulzbot.com/project/flexystruder_assembly/ basically the v2 omits the side tension screw and has a hexagon nozzle that fits into a lower socket."
building an enclosure,"so i decided i wanted a piece of furniture for my printer to reside in.  i have a bunch of rough cut mahogany left over from ammunition crates during the golf war, and this is what has become of sum of it.

it is built from mahogany, birch plywood panels and a few 3d printed parts.  at the top for filament to enter is a 1 foot long slot with brushes on both sides to try ant retain heat.  the electronics enclosure port i used from jonathanb's hot box enclosure.  i did design a simi matching internal trim plate for it.  also designed and 3d printed adjustable inset door stops for the door.

the black bottom is also a drawer so the printer can be pulled out for maintenance.
im not sold on the door, which is why weatherstripping has not been added, i may change my mind and make it a sliding door.

the base will match the top in materials, it will have one drawer (not full depth, there will be a shelf on the back for a ups power supply)  under the drawer will be a cabinet for storing filament.  the bottom sill be weatherstripped so that i can make use of a small dehumidifier.

tell me what you think!












","here is the dry fit of one panel and the rest of the base, i have since glued both sides of the base up, and am getting ready to add the back.

there will be no top just some runners going front to back to allow the enclosure to be attached to the base. the base is 46 inches tall, the whole unit will be nearly 72 inches tall.

im thinking 4 drawers, bottom two tall enough to fit standing rolls of filament top one only tall enough for commonly used tools, and the 2nd drawer a little larger to accommodate whatever else...  i also want to do hand cut dovetails for the drawers, but i need to practice a lot before i do that, otherwise i will use dowels with a contrasting color.  drawers will be made from pine, fronts are undecided, i have some amazing looking oak i may use but i planned on using it for a bed frame repair.

wood materials used are as such:
3 8ft long 2""x6"" rough cut mahogany i have 2 3ft sections left
3 sheets of birch plywood 3/4 of one sheet left

lulzbot taz 5 printing skewed holes,"hey everyone,

i'm wondering if this is a x-axis alignment issue: it seems that all my holes and/or insets are printing with a slight skew up and to the right. it might be hard to see in the attached pictures but it is definitely there. has anyone ever run into this problem? i'm printing with hips at 220 c with a 0.13 layer height.

thanks!","there is something wrong, 886 is unusual high. most users report values between 800 and 840.
you wrote you printed - what? the basic calibration is done extruding 100mm filament into free air and measuring the delta length that was really driven through. mark the filament 120mm above the extruder, extrude and measure again. now the mark has to be 20mm above. 

fine tuning is done by printing flat 20mm calibration cubes, about 3-5mm high at a layer height of 0,1mm and 100% infill.  examine the top surface with a magnifier, if there are gaps between the layers increase esteps by 0,5%, if not decrease by 0.5%. that takes some time, but it's the key to success."
taz 6 - scratched my build plate?,"the taz 6 is my first 3d printer and so far it has been a blast. i processed 8 successful prints (benchy, test geometry, a deer of all things) and have had no issues...until i lifted my last print off to find this: http://imgur.com/jaotudf



it seems like somehow for a portion of the print the nozzle was too low and lightly etched the build surface...it is only for this corner and the rest of the square print seemed fine. it doesn't seem too deep, but i can feel it if i run my nail over it. i watched the print start and it seemed to level and lay down the perimeter fine...

so, as a rookie to all of this i was looking for some assistance:

a. could this have damaged my build plate and nozzle in some way? initial reading makes me think i have just scratched the pei layer, but i am not sure how exactly to tell.

b. any ideas on what could have caused this? my taz 6 was one of the early serial numbers that needed the frame to be re-squared...i followed the directions in the service bulletin and have had no grinding or binding that i can tell...the print seemed to auto-level fine after wiping the nozzle.

thanks for any assistance.","thanks, that's good to know. the part wasn't removed with any tools, it was a small print and my finger nail popped it right off, which is why i am assuming these are marks left by the extruder...

the scratches seem to match the layout of the print.

either way, i have thoroughly cleaned the nozzle and will give it another go.

taz 3 with hexagon hot end - z axis endstop problem,"i have a taz 3 that i have replaced the budaschnozzle with a hexagon hot end. everything seems to be working well after flashing with the appropriate firmware and i've done two successful prints so far. 

one issue, however, is that the z-axis end stop adjustment has to be unscrewed nearly all the way up to allow the hot end to be adjusted. it seems the hexagon hot end is shorter than the budaschnozzle?

i'm looking for some ideas on how to fix this.... reprint the left side z-axis parts with a modified z-axis screw adjuster, though this seems like a huge pain.

taz 5 stopped working,"i've had a taz 5 for about 3 weeks now and it has been working fine.  started an overnight print last night (have done them before) and this morning it was stopped mid-print with the extruder just sitting where you'd expect it to print.  print bed and extruder were cool.

now, nothing is working.  none of the motors will move (or attempt to move).  the screen on the taz 5 ""works"" as i can scroll through the menus.  when connected to the computer and using cura, i can ""connect"" to the printer but i cannot control the x, y, or z movement.  the upper right corner of the cura control screen has a button that says ""motors off"".  i don't know if this means they are off or i can press this to turn them off.

flexy dually - almost there (print quality),"things are starting to look pretty good.  i've started to make a few custom models.  i'm presently surprised how straight forward and relatively simple it's been to design models for the dual materials (i was worried that would be the hardest part).  

i've made many adjustments to temp, flow, print speeds, etc.  my latest print happens to be one of the fastest:

235 ic3d abs
225 ninja flex
85 bed w/ glue stick
ooze guard
20 mms print speed
30 infill speed
10 first layer
98% flow
adjusted fillament diameters based on average
2.82 ninja
2.91 abs
.18 layer height


the results are pretty good.  ninja tends to ooze but the guard helps. 

i would like to figure out a way to keep the abs particles out of the ninja flex though (and vise versa, but the former is bothering me more). 

i might tweak temps and maybe increase retraction? (already set to 35 though). 

any other tips?","some tweaks.  slight improvement.

first - tried lowering ninja flex temp.  anything under 225 results in a failed print.  225 seems to be a good temp.  the ninja does ooze quit a bit though.   anything colder gets jammed up a few layers into the print.  still 225 results i'm happy with.  

next - lowered ic3d abs temp to 232.  improved slightly    the thing is that the ooze guard results in small particles being dropped.  these are then picked up by the nozel and moved onto model during other extruder movements.  most of the particles in the model come from this type of thing. 

finally - i increased retraction to 40.  not a very noticeable difference.  probably not worth the change.

i haven't tried the wipe and prime tower.  that's my next tweak.  cura doesn't have a wipe and coast option.  should i look to slic3r?   i hear people say good things about it, but am comfortable with cura.  does slic3r support the flexy dually?

the interesting things about all the prints.  the imperfections are all in the same locations (except for the occasional fillament imperfection).  the sloppy ninja side is near the ninja seem.  the abs particles on the opposite side are about the t0 nozel distance away from that same seem.  

what i'm not showing is the ninja abs shadow ooze.  basically the pattern of the abs center outside the model formed by the inactive extruder.  ninja likes to ooze.  the ooze guard helps at keeping these away from the print.   i cannot seem to address.  any cooler and ninja runs into extrude problems.  additional retraction didn't help.  this isn't an issue per say, but does need to be taken into consideration when modelling.  i also think the quality would improve if the extruder changed more frequently.  this model is basically to parts.  (tire and rim).

taz heatbed: use 85c not 110c,"the taz only needs 85c for the heatbed, not 110c. we are updating the next print of the manual, and have included an errata. fyi.","well mainly it because the 110c setting was used for the ao-101's and the taz, having a different bed has a different setting of 85c. (it should have always been 85c for the taz in the manual, but we did not see the error until after they manuals were printed...sigh)that the simple answer, in reality the temperature on the top surface of the pet that is on the glass should be similar between the ao-101 and the taz even thought they are ""set"" differently. this is due to mainly different temperature sensor locations and the different materials that make up each bed have different thermal properties.  

the reason we don't suggest going higher than 85c, even if it can help sometimes with warping and pealing, is that it can discolor abs if it is too warm. this is really noticeable with natural abs as it will start to turn brown if it sits for to long on an bed that is too warm."

","brent.i wrote:the taz 6 automatic bed leveling feature will indeed be compatible with the v2 dual extruders. this will automatically level the rear hot end, and the end user can raise/lower the front hot end to match. 

as for getting them now, the dual extruder is recommended for advanced/expert users. it usually takes about 3 to 4 months of successful single headed operation to become familiar with the machine. it may be worth the wait to become more comfy with the machine before diving in.

hope this helps!

taz 6 enclosure - relocate lcd/controls outside?,"since the control lcd/control and power supply are now housed in a single unit, it looks like relocating the lcd/sd card/controls to outside of an enclosure will be a lot more difficult. are there any pics around of inside the new single electrical box?","you can do what i did, but there are some steps i took to make it as tight a fit as possible without rewiring the taz 6.  the whole idea for me was to expose the channel in the 20mm extrusion so i could slide the polycarbonate panel through the slot.  

1.  replace upper face mounted corner brackets with new inside corner brackets--misumi
2.  notch the upper z axis bearing/rod holder to expose the aluminum extrusion channel
3.  countersink two bolts on lower front corner bracket extrusion to accept a flat head machine screw and allow polycarb to slide over the bracket closely.

taz 6 - motors different height - dampeners,"i just received the taz 6 and it's quite nice  the power supply fan rarely kicks on compared to the 5.

one thing i noticed while assembling was that either these new moon steppers are a different height from those on the t5, or the entire frame sits lower than the taz 5 (shorter feet?) because the y-axis stepper literally sits right on the table that the taz sits on. there is no clearance, or maybe a few mm. on the taz 5 there was at least 3/8"" clearance and left room for the nema dampeners viewtopic.php?f=43&t=2800. basically, if we want to add the dampeners to the taz 6 we will need to lift the frame by 1/4""-3/8"" or so","can you not raise the entire thing up half an inch off the table? super inconvenient thought... 

i just installed the dampener on my tax 5 y axis last night (in the middle of piercets open rail upgrade). there is literally no clearance after the install. maybe a few millimeters. i originally thought it wouldn't clear. 

not to derail the thread. but out of curiosity, does everyone move the pulley on the stepper motor up the stepper shaft  6mm to compensate for  the dampener, or does it all turn out fine? i tried to slide it up, mine appears to have some adhesive holding the pulleys to the shaft in addition to the tiny screw. i was planning to not worry about it and just reassemble it and see how it worked out. 6mm and the angle offset over more than a foot of travel seemed like not a lot to me."

[taz5] noise during z homing,"hi there,

(sorry for the english i'm french)
here we have 2 taz 5 : one had pb to do the z homing : it used to stop after few milimeters down and doing a horrible noise. i have to shut down the printer to stop it.

i've think about check the difference between the left & right axis and with a caliper tryed to fix it : after a desesperate second try at the bottom of the axis it works now but in a strange way... the homing go entierly and the machine allow me to do something else now but during the z move it continue to do a weird electronic noise during one second.

i guess my 2 z motor has not the same height ? how can i fix it very occurately ?
thx a lot. ","you can try running the burnin gcode file in calibration and see if it makes the noise, or put the following gcode in a file and try it.
code: select allg28

g1 f250 z240
g1 f250 z2
g1 f250 z240
g1 f250 z2
g1 f250 z240
g1 f250 z20



this just runs the carriage up and down on z. 

i have seen printers that work fine at the lower speeds the code moves it at. but during z homing operations the z steppers motors spin quicker and will bind. usually due to the tightness of the x axis drive belt pulling in the back of the x end plates slightly. adding just enough extra drag to bind the axis."
taz 6 oddity...,"hello all:
i received my taz 6 today!!!

i was able to print something after a while. the issue at first was leveling. 
i'm paranoid with new stuff, so i watched very carefully as this thing started!!

the printer would push on the button, wipe the nozzle (which wipes over the plastic edge mostly. i need to figure out how to adjust that.), then it would touch each corner button. on the last button, it would just stop. nothing more ever happened. 
oh, i should mention that i'm running octoprint. i can't see that it makes a difference, though.
after trying again, it printed ok!
try again, and it failed just like the first time, at the last leveling button.
this was all with ngen filament, as i have a few spools of it from my mini.

so, in summary:
1. my taz 6 doesn't wipe the cleaner far enough to the outside. it wipes the plastic inner edge mostly. i think i found out how to change that in the cura initial gcode. i am running the newest cura.
2. my taz 6 won't continue about half the time after leveling. it won't continue after the last button is touched.
3. not mentioned above, but i need to lower the z for the first layer. it is too high by probably 3/4 to 1mm. 

anyone have some insight here?
i'll continue playing. this is an awesome design! 
(i wonder why it's slower than my mini?)","wow, i emailed support yesterday after you, nopick, mentioned that they have weekend support.

they responded last night (friday)!!

i have everything resolved now. i found that the leveling issue was that the z axis was way off from one side to the other. 
after i got the z sides the same, the z would bind, just buzzing away. when they were 5mm or more off, it would not bind, but the leveling was intermittent. 
i ended up leveling the sides again, and then loosening the vertical parts that are on the threaded rod with ninjaflex between them. i then snugged them up again. the theory is that this would allow them to align and not bind. 
that seemed to work!

as far as the nozzle not hitting the cleaner properly, i just moved the whole bed over in x. that fixed that!

the z is adjustable in the front panel. how nice is that! that was in the email from support.

now everything seems to be working fine!

i am really beginning to appreciate just how adjustable the taz is! i'm used to the mini which has very little adjustment.

i am a happy camper now!!"

flexydually - clogged front hotend on test print,"hello all,

all setup and calibrated.  excitement growing.  front end clogging on keychain print. 

i'm using the filament shipped with tool head, the latest cura, quick print standard abs & ninja flex, and the recommended temps  (t0: 240, bed: 100, t1: 220)  

half way through the first print the flexible material started to clog.  i cleared it out (removed the filament entirely, cut the shredded end off, turned up heat, extruded any remaining material,  fed ninja back through and extruded until clean extrusion occurred, extruded another 10mm for good luck )   i also adjusted the z axis slightly before the second print.  the first layer of the first print seemed a tad flat to me. the second print same problem,  but much earlier in process.  

any advice on how to resolve this or this to try?","oh and any advice on improving the abs would be appreciated as well.  since putting the new tool head on, i've been more focused on the ninjaflex side of things and leaning towards out of the box settings.  i haven't gone through and fine tuned my abs yet in expert mode.   i've had success in the past doing the following:

1) measuring and adjusting filament width.  this was printed with default 2.85 where i find the spool averages closer to 2.96
2) adjusting temp (using ic3d abs i find it actually likes relatively lower temps 235). this was printed at 240 (which i believe is the main reason for strings on top and particles in ninjaflex)
3) adjusting layer height and fill percentage.  i lean towards .15 height and 40% infill.  default i think is 20 and 20 respectively.  
4) speed.  although the flexy dual head default already seem slower than i've printed in the past.  

i've never adjusted flow % but see that recommended a lot.  going to check it out. 
i'm not convinced my bed is as level as it should be (kind of did it quickly from the excitement.  eager to print).  i still use paper method (which i hate).  i never know the proper tension for the paper.   i'm going to purchase a digital gauge or two and switch to that method.   leveling and calibrating z height is where i have the least confidence."
installing firmware,"is this guide under construction, or is this really all there is? i was hoping for something slightly more detailed than just ""install firmware."" like, maybe, some steps to follow, so i know i'm not going to fry anything? https://ohai.lulzbot.com/project/cura-f ... -flashing/","you shouldn't have to update the firmware for anything related to the bed. just start with 105 degrees and raise or lower as you are able. many people find tube sweet spot with a taz to be near 110. 

marlin refers to the project name of the particular branch of arduino firmware that the taz uses. it is in turn derivative of the earlier sprinter firmware which is why you sometimes see marlin/sprinter as the name. 

cura will update the firmware automatically from compiled firmware if you like. if you want to build your own version, or edit settings you would want to change you can use the arduino ide ""integrated development environment"" to compile and upload the individual c code based files. the process isn't as scary as it sounds. you just make a folder, get all the files that make up the firmware and any support files, make your changes (usually configuration.h ) and hit the compile button. if you did it right, it will compile and you can then hit upload. if it errors, post them here and we can help fix them.

need guidance: printing calibration cubes with flat corners,"hi,

i'm printing these cubes in hips filament. they come out fine at a higher layer setting (0.2mm) but when i print them at 0.12mm the corners flatten at the bottom. would appreciate any suggestions. i'm actually getting better prints at a low nozzle temp (220 c) with the bed at 110 c but the corner flattening is stumping me.","this is entirely a temperature issue, and very likely related to your bed temp keeping the bottom of your part too hot/soft. hips is a bit, finicky, and you definitely want to print at the lowest nozzle temp you can while still getting good extrusion. start by tweaking your bed temp. personally i print the first few layers at 110, then after about .5mm drop the bed temp to 100. some sources will tell you to go as low as 90-95 so you can experiment with that, but i've found i lose adhesion that low. you can also play with your fan speed. i've found that with hips a range of 40-60% works pretty well. most importantly though, make any changes to your settings one at a time, and document what's happening so you know exactly which setting is having what effect.

taz5 producing rough surface,"i tried printing a part for a model u-boat, but for some reason, every time i print a particular part, the surface come out rough.  the unusual thing is that only the bottom surfaces are rough for about a couple of centimeters, then the part prints out smoothly.  i don't know what is going on, but it seems to be only this part.  every other part prints without issues, and i changed the print speed several times from 20mm to 50mm a second, buy the flaws continue to appear at the exact same location.  i'm currently printing with pla at 200 c.  here is a picture below.  notice that the flaws are only at the bottom.  is there something wrong with the g-code?","i'm still fairly new to this world, so take this with a grain of salt.  

is it possible it's areas of overhang that are printing that way.  looking at the picture it seems like those lower areas might be areas of overhang.  i've read tips to improve overhang, to try reducing print temperature (presumably so it cools mid air quicker).  slowing + cooling might be a bad combo though so adhere to the common warnings - change one seeing are a time.  maybe try 195? (i've had some success with pla at 195).  

reducing layer height may also help.  

anyway, my best guess is that this is from the overhang."
taz 4 print issue,"does anyone have any idea what causes the print issue in this photo? when printing i am getting these jagged steps in my layers. i don't think it is the model because it does it on all prints and it ends up making the prints not look as nice. any suggestions are appreciated. 

using a taz 4 with budaschnozzle current firmware
hips (does the same with abs)
cura 19.08","indeed, the ""waves"" you are seeing in your first layer will be due to your initial z height being too close. what happens is there is not enough room for the first layer of plastic to extrude. this causes a back pressure in the nozzle, which will build and slightly raise the hotend to extrude the pressure. once extruded it will lower back down until it builds again. due to the consistent first layer infill, this pressure builds to critical in about the same locations as it is fills in the base layer creating the waves. give a 1/8th to 1/4th turn of the z axis thumb stop counter clockwise and it should get you fixed up.

taz 6 head w/ dual cooling fans,"hello,

modified cat guard taz 4/5 cabinet,"hi,

i recently started printing larger abs parts on my taz 5 printer, and as such ran into issues with warping and splitting. having discussed options with james bruton, it was suggested that my issues were temperature related, so i took the box that the taz was shipped in and made a temporary cabinet out of it. it worked great! however, i did want something a little more permanent and easier to use.

my initial research took me to the cat guard which i liked the look of due to its simplistic construction, ease of modification, and that fact you could simply take the box off and the printer would continue to function stand alone.  however, it did seem rather large, so i moved the cable spool and made a smaller modified verison of the structure. also liked the idea of using the dead space above the printer for storage.

here is my version:









as you can see above, the cable spool spigot needs cutting in half so it doesn't interfere with the bed.

initial temperature tests show that the internal temperature of the cabinet with the bed at 110 degrees, climbs by about 15 degrees warmer than ambient room temperature within 20 to 25 mins. i'm not sure it would go much higher than this without some additional insulation. i ran a print this morning, external temperature was 15, at the end of the job the internal temperature was just over 30.

i posted a few progress/build images to an old blog site of mine here: mantis robot build log","thanks.

yeah i already have an inlet manifold printed that fits over the fan and would pull cool air into the electronics. however, due to the poor insulation of the acrylic cabinet, currently i've only seen internal temperatures of 35 to 40 degrees. the electronics should be happy at this temperature, and if anyhtunk help heat the cabinet a bit   

i have an exhaust fan mod standing by, temperature controlled but it doesn't look like i'll be getting hot enough to use it. unless i insulate some of the panels better."

x axis grining and not moving,"hello, 

i am having trouble with my x axis. it is making a grinding noise when i ""home"" it and doesn't move as freely as usual.

here is a video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qy22e-l1mjc

i had e-mailed lulzbot support about this and they sent me a new motor. i changed the motor, however this has not solved the problem. in fact it now has a much smaller range of motion than in the video. does anyone have any advice?

thanks!","if you pull the belt off  the y motor and then swap the motor x and y axis at the rambo board, and the problem transfers to the y motor, you have a bad rambo board. if the issue remains with the x axis, you have a short in the cable path, or a swapped pin. 

the way a stepper motor works, is there are two coil loops that work together to turn the motor shaft, add force, and make the motor work properly. the first coil is pin 1 and 2, the second is pin 3 and 4 of the 4 pin motor connector block. if one of those two coil loops are cut anywhere between the rambo than you will get a motor that doesn't turn strongly. it will move some, but just weakly, and can fail to move sometimes and or grind. it will be easier to turn in the correct direction, and offer resistance if you try to turn it against the direction it wants to go, but not nearly as strong as it would normally turn. 

if you instead have one of the two pins swapped, you end up with a magnet coil in opposition to the other one, which ends up basically making two magnets fight for control of the motor shaft. in that scenario you will hear a loud buzzing and the shaft will vibrate but not move much at all, and will be hard to turn either way.

based on the symptoms you are seeing so far, and the fact that you have replaced the motor already, the issue is one of the following (in order of likelihood): 
1. you have one or more pins loose at a wire harness connection point. (where the motor attaches to the wire harness, where the harness attaches to the rambo, etc.)
2. you have one or more pins swapped in the wire harness (pin came out, got put back in the wrong spot) 
3. you have a physical wire issue on the wire harness (warranty service issue) 
4. you have a bad motor controller or pin block on the rambo board itself. 
5. your printer is actually haunted. 
6. your printer is actually haunted, but that's not the problem and it's really also just broken.

edit, if it were the power supply you would be experiencing other issues. it's also very unlikely that both motors are broken. you can test them by swapping them in on the y axis."
how do i print details smaller than 1mm on the taz 5?,"hi folks, sorry if this is a noob question. i just got a taz 5 a couple weeks ago, and one of the projects i tried was replacing a missing battery door. there's a notch to hold it straight, and my for initial print i made the notch about 1x1x4 mm in openscad. that printed more or less fine, but it was a little too big to actually fit. 

so i went back and tried 0.5x1x4mm but then the notch didn't print at all, just a flat surface where i was expecting it. i tried bumping it to 0.9mm and it still didn't seem to print. 

the notch appears when i open the stl file in cura lulzbot edition, and also in the preview on my astrobox, but just doesn't seem to print no matter what i try. 

is this a physical limitation of the printer, or am i just doing something wrong? i can upload the files if anyone would like.",that's a common problem with most slicers available. the only slicer i know that handles small details with perfection is the latest development version of slic3r. but you have to compile it yourself. .
dual extruder advanced usage,"hello all dual extruder users, both present and future!

i have had many questions about how to use the dual extruder to do specific things (sometimes basic things) that aren't always straight forward. i thought i would post some of my findings here for the community to work on as well.

the most blatant thing that seems simple but at least in cura is not straightforward (yet) is how to print a single material part using the front extruder instead of the back. so here goes the simple fix:

front extruder only on dual extruder

in full settings in cura, go to the ""start/end gcode"" tab, and add the following lines to your start gcode, preferably right after the ""g28"" command(s):
code: select allg1 y50					;move y to new offset position
g92 y0					;set new y offset
t1						;activate e1

now load your stl, place it where you want it on the bed, slice, breathe normally, and print.

you will notice one significant change during the beginning of your print, namely that after homing all axes (g28) the print head will move forward 50mm in y. this is effectively positioning your front nozzle (e1) to where your back nozzle (e0) usually sits, and redefining that as your new y=0 position. and yes, for all those who want to be even more accurate, you can substitute your actual extruder 2 y offset for the ""50"", just to be more exact. and if you are really shooting for pinpoint accuracy you can also add your x offset in there, and then add ""x0"" to the g92 line.

so if you have a flexydually and want to print something big in ninjaflex, here's a simple and straightforward way to get it done. oh, one final thought about this. you may notice that when slicing in cura with a two-material print, cura restricts your use of the back of the bed. this is because as far as it knows, your front extruder (e1) can't travel back there. but if you disable your steppers and pull your bed forward, you will notice that your taz can just about make it. doing the above fix will ignore this because cura sort of thinks you are still using e0, so it will let you use the full bed, and the gcode will override firmware limits in the y-axis (ps, we didn't lie, we just told cura to do something without it really understanding what it is doing). just note that if you call alllll the way to the very back, your bed may come forward enough to hit the frame, and without an endstop there, it will be noisy (shouldn't hurt much though).

this leads me to one more simple fix, which is..

using the full bed size with the dual extruder

this one is much more simple. basically, in cura go into ""machine settings"" and tell cura that your bed is +50mm long, or 325mm in y. this will allow you to print over the full y-length of the bed with your two-material print. that one was easy, wasn't it! (okay, this time we lied to cura. it should get over it once it sees how awesome your print is)

let me know of other dual extruder functionality that would be good to delve into!","ray, i'm wondering how to trick cura into slicing with a ninjaflex profile? (my guess is that a merged model uses e0 filament settings for the first-loaded model part, and e1 flex filament settings and nozzle size for the other model part?)

i used the t1 trick from the print control window, and while it definitely used e1, the result wasn't all that great   that might be because it's my first actual ninjaflex print, or it could be because cura sliced the model for 0.5mm abs? (i noticed a gaps between perimiter in some places, and the retraction commands didn't seem to match the calibration test print)

is there anything else i can do for having cura target ninjaflex profile, before using gcode to configure flexydually v2 for an e1-only print? maybe i can hand-roll a cura profile that does this?? do folks use profiles for this kind of customisation?"
taz 6 single or dual head,"taz 6 is out tomorrow (17 may 2016) 

can anyone give me good reason(s).... apart from cost.... on the pro and con of fitting a dual extruder, with a single nozzle / filament in use, as opposed to the ""standard"" single extruder head?","with a dual extruder, your single extruder prints will typically be slightly slower due to the additional extruder mass. the dual extruder also exerts more torque force on the rods, which 12mm ones should compensate for.  it also reduces your theoretical overall bed travel if the single extruder you are using is the outer one. thats about it."
simple ninjaflex mod,"just wanted to share a little tip i happened upon on over at matterhackers. it isn't a replacement for the convenience of a flexystruder, but it does allow fairly sucessful ninjaflex printing with a standard taz 5 extruder. i tried it. it is hard to get the bit of tube cut precisely - it needs to be as long as possible without interfering with the idler or hobbed bolt - but once you get it cut properly, it works. i'm not getting kinks in the ninjaflex anymore!

successful printing???,"hey all, we recently purchase a taz 5 for our classroom.  it is our second printer, the other being an old 3d touch.   recently we have been running a lot of parts and have had very few successes with the taz.

if i run pla i get a clogged extruder nozzle.  if i run abs i get such poor bed adhesion and warping that any part over about 1.5"" square is guaranteed to fail.

we run 3mm matter hackers filaments and process using cura
we have tried the following temp settings both with and without cooling fan.
---------bed temp-------  extruder
abs----100-110------- 240-250
pla----90-100--------- 200-210

i have tried running various speeds and infills, but we typically use 20% infill and stock feed rates (they have given the best results).
out of 20 abs parts this week, 6 printed without a complete failure, and only 2 of those 6 were useable and not excessively warped.  we have completely given up on pla.

where do we begin to make this printer operational?","i cant speak for pla as i only print in abs but your bed adhesion issues might be caused by bed leveling/z height ect. use 110c for the bed and 240c for the nozzle. its rarely your temps that cause adhesion issues as these tend remain constant.

1)  make sure your bed is leveled. i personally got tired of messing with the finicky paper trick (which is actually fairly accurate if done correctly) and just bought a $15 dial indicator from harbour freight to guarantee bed level.

2) once you know your bed is level, dial in you initial z-height. you need to squish that first layer into the pei bed. without squish it wont stick. i find the recommended ""printer paper barely dragging"" to be a little to high. give your z end stop a quarter turn clockwise. i personally calibrate z-height by  sight. keep lowering the z end stop (and thus lowering the nozzle) and printing a few lines until you start to see tracking (center of the extruded line is thinner than the edges). it will look like a wheel rut. once you achieve this, slowly raise the z height until you no longer have tracking. it takes a little time the first few times, but eventually this whole process doesn't take longer than 5-10 minutes.

3) lastly make sure to clean the bed. rubbing alcohol works... kinda. after every few prints i sand my pei with 2000 grit sand paper. put some elbow grease into it."
flexydually or dual extruder,"i'm going to order the taz 6 on tuesday. which of the dual extruders is more useful? i've heard that using soluable support like pva isn't too useful, is that true? 

i'd like to be able to use ninjaflex and occasionally do dual extrusion of two stiff materials. what parts of the flexible extruder are going to wear out and how quickly? how difficult would it be to replace the parts when it's needed? how easy would be to replace the flexile extruder with the normal extruder that comes with the printer?

i'd like to experiment with conductive filament with some other stiff plastic at some point but it's probably going to bee only a print or two.","dissolvable support generally is more of a pain than it is worth unless you are printing something that uses internal supports that cannot be printed any other way. even then it's usually easier to just redesign whatever it is so it prints without that support than it is to break out the chemicals. 

the flexydualy probably has slightly greater utility from a mechanical perspective, but most people who experement with dual extrusion end up making multi color objects out of solid fillament. the flexistruder wear part is the ptfe tube liner. it will wear fairly quickly with solid fillament. to replace it is fairly inexpensive. you put in a new section of tubing, drill it out from the top to the proper diameter with the correct metric drill, and drill the front face out with the larger drill to cut the relief for where the hobbed bolt goes in contact (that ones a 13mm drill, i forget what the other one is, maybe a 3.5mm? mcmaster carr has the bits) you do need a drill press to get good results. 

one or two prints shouldn't affect the liner that much. daily printing with solid fillament would wear it pretty quickly."

mike.stanley wrote:
1) how often do you clean the hot ends?  

for a taz 5, you technically don't really ever have to clean the hotend. i usually pull any strings or crusty bits off of the surface with a pair of needlenose pliers periodically, and i have set up a nozzle wiper like the taz mini has for general cleaning. i've never encountered a nozzle ""jam"" and most of the ones you hear about (or clogs, etc.) are actually either bits of old fillament that has different temperature properties, or nozzles that are too close to a bed at start, or grinding out due to part lifting or overextrusion, etc. it's very rarely an actual clog.
mike.stanley wrote:
2) what is the best method(s) for cleaning hot ends

never ever ever ever use a wire brush. there is a risk of shorting out the thermistor or the heater core and destroying your hot end. you can use a mild scotchbrite pad with the nozzle heated slightly. depending on what you are printing, if you are printing abs you can wipe the surface down with acetone. some people use internal cleaning fillament. i think its generally a waste of money. 

if you do the conductive auto leveling (mini style) modification, it becomes very important to keep the nozzle tip clean as well for proper leveling. 
mike.stanley wrote:
3) how often should one replace the pei sheet on the hot bed? 

prefferably never. you should only have to replace it if it is damaged, or if you are getting large bubbles. if you are getting large bubbles, it indicates you are putting too much upward force on parts when removing them. you need to change to a better part removal tool that is able to lever small sections of the part away from the bed at a time. the caphalon gadgets cheese wedge with the slicer bit taped over works great for that. or a paint scraper. if you do have a large bubble, you can remove the pei sheet by placing the entire bed assembly in the freezer, waiting for the pei to get cold enough to separate (probably several hours) and then peeling it off. then you can carefully remove the adhesive sheet, using something like goof off or other orange oil based solvent sparingly and carefully so as not to separate the heater core to remove the rest of the glue. clean the surface 3 times with glass cleaner, then apply a new adhesive sheet and reapply your pei. the pei sheet does have two different surface profiles, so unless it is damaged, you generally want the normal print surface ""up""

best way to clean glue stick from taz 5 pei bed?,"i've used glue stick to print petg, but now i'd like to clean the pei bed. what is the best thing to use to gently clean the pei surface yet remove the glue stick residue?","at our university, we've found that the best way to get a standard glue stick off the pei bed is to carefully wet the bed with water.  what we do is get a rag well soaked with tap water, and then carefully wipe the bed with it.  we make sure not to drip the water onto any electronic parts, and we don't use a spray bottle because of the danger of overspray onto sensitive parts. we then wait about 5 minutes. waiting is the critical part. glue will thicken up into a gel in the water. we then take a scraper and gently scrape it off onto a paper towel.  next, we spray it one more time with water lightly, and wipe it clean.  that's it! no fuss, comes completely clean.

we do use alcohol to get the adhesive from masking tape off if we've been printing nylon, but it hasn't been as effective as water for the glue sticks.  

one warning: i'd strongly advise against getting the bed wet when it's hot. could shatter! happened to a pie plate in the oven once for me."

thanks","hi corr

i am not sure if and how the controller checks the thermistor and thus you should check that one as well.
there are chances that the controller switches the heater off if the thermistor is gone.

as you are in a maker space i guess you have a multimeter at hand!?
with that you can check the continuity of the wires as well as the resistance of the heater sections and the thermistor.
you would need a needle for the wire checks in order to penetrate the insulation of the wires close to the heat bed.

with the multimeter in resistance mode and the the connectors disconnected from the controller first check if you can measure any resistance in the heat bed. just from the connector. the heat bed (thicker white wires) should be in the low ohms range and the thermistor should be around 100kohms at room temperature.
in case one of the to is showing extreme high resistance this is the one were you have the pain to check if the wires are ok.
here the needle gets handy. you stick it into the wire as close as possible to the heat bed and then measure that wire from the connector to the needle. if that is around 0 ohms the wire is ok if not you probably found the culprit. 

repairing a broken wire is quick done if you have a soldering iron and some heat shrink at hand.
the thermistor can be repaired / replaced as well. here is only the calibration to be checked after replacing.
if the heat bed itself is burned..... well.... this to fix is not so easy... sorry

i've been looking into possibly upgrading my taz 5 with an openrails retrofit to all axises. has anyone calculated the full cost of this and is there a detailed guide for the installation?","the thingiverse.com pages are the currently most compete and detailed installation guides. as far as cost goes, its around $75 for x for hardware, $95 for y and $95 for z if you go with the highest end wheel options. z may not be worth it from a cost benefit perspective as it doesn't offer the dramatic improvement the x and y do. plastic costs end up a couple pounds of plastic total if you do all three. 

i am working on better installation documentation. i need one more leadscrew nut before i can finish the second frame though. 

ill be happy to answer any questions on the install you might have"

mini flexystruder on taz 5?,"hi all, just recently got my taz 5. loving it so far, but i want to give some flexible filaments a try. preferably even print one flexible and one traditional filament in the same print, a la flexydually. i don't really have the means to get a flexydually though after spending all that money on the taz 5, with my wedding approaching in september. i found a (single) flexstruder locally that someone is selling for a very discounted price, but i then realized lulzbot specifies a flexstruder for the taz and a different one for the mini and the one for sale is for the mini. would it work if i bought the mini flexstruder for the discount price, then print all the carriage elements for the flexydually and combine my stock extruder and mini flexstruder onto the new printed flexydually frame?

any feedback is really appreciated! thanks in advance!","minor correction to piercet's response: 

you will need print a new taz extruder mount (not carriage) and mount the mini's hotend, extruder, and fans on the newly printed extruder mount.

you can also reuse your current extruder mount at the expense of additional work required whenever you want to change between standard and flexi prints."

"noisy x-axis, but only on slow movement","folks, i have hardened rods and metal bushings, but for the life of me, can't figure out why i'm geting such bad resonating on the x-axis. strangely, it only happens during certain movements. here's an example...https://youtu.be/kaohuksjy5k.

i checked for level, and everything is tight. i've tried re-seating the bearings, but seems to still happen. thoughts?","you might have just found a harmonic vibration frequincy. certain speeds will produce sounds that resonate better than others. i would suspect a loose screw with a washer in it somewhere on the x or y axis that si vibrting rapidly at that speed. you can minimize some of that noise by adding astrosyn dampers to the x and y axis (don't bother with the z axis, the printer doesn't move enough on z to be worth the effort and it won't fit easily on the extruder.  it's either that or you have a belt rubbing somewhere, or maybe a bearing starting to go in a motor but that would be less likely."
scratch on glass bed,i am a teacher and working with high school students.   this week we have opened up our taz 5 and started printing.  we have already started to make some small scratches in the glass heated table.  i do not see specific advice about managing this.  i really appreciate your hard earned insights.,"well the good news is the glass is covered with a sheet of pei, so its probably not damaged... which really is good because the borosilicate glass is difficult to find.

so it sounds like you gouged the pei... probably with the clamshell knife they supply.  a gouge can be sanded out, but make sure to sand the entire surface and not just a single spot.  otherwise you'll leave a low spot in the pei.  a fine grit is recommended.

to prevent this in the future, use a tool like a spatula style cheese slicer (filing down the slicer is recommended) or a artist paint knife.  or this rounded paint knife with a larger surface.  the keys to these tools is the slight angle that offsets the handle from the spatula blade, which allows the blade to slip under the object by pushing the tool.  once under the print, work around the object.  resist the urge to pry upwards, this will put stress on the pei and it will eventually release from the glass.. bubbling.  as you work your way around the object, it should pop off the bed at some point.  

its also recommended to remove parts at bed temps lower than 60c to help the adhesive.  50c is good for most materials.  see lulzbot recommendations for part removal temp.

mitigating the aggressive adhesion can be as simple as raising the nozzle by .1-.2mm through the z-offset setting in your slicer. typically that's for abs.  but the method really depends on the material you're printing.  for pet and ninjaflex, a layer of glue stick will lessen the adhesion to the pei.

the pei in the end is a better print surface overall.  its durable and does away with blue tape, kapton, abs slurry, hair spray... that can get messy or become a hassle, imo.

nozzles,"i think i've asked this before, but does anyone know if the little pointy hex nozzles work alright in the newer hexagon hot end? the thread is the same, but shorter by the look of it. can't see why they wouldn't work alright. i think they're the ones from makerbots by the look of them, they're not the e3d v6 ones which definitely work fine.

i needed a large one (.8mm i'm trying) to try before the weekend and they were the only ones i could find that would ship in time without paying 4x the nozzles value for express shipping.","i have onenof hear different nozzles coming, was only £2 so hardly bank breaking if it doesn't work. thought it was worth trying. the thread actually looks the same as the original one that comes with the hexagon, i was comparing to the longer e3d nozzles.

without wanting to start a new thread, has anyone transported their taz around? thinking of bringing mine home for the weekend for a long print. i can't leave it on at work at present as we're not insured for leaving machines unmanned. i know nothing will happen but with my luck if i leave it something will. if it's going be an effort i won't bother, but if it's just re levelling the bed or some other menial task then i think i will."
printing fine details with taz 5,"i'm relatively new to 3d printing. i have a new taz 5 with the 0.5 nozzle. i've found i get pretty nice details on small prints (wargaming figures) but i wonder if a 0.35 nozzle will increase the detail quality?

have other people tried this? is it worth the bother?

how do you manage different nozzle sizes? do you manually change nozzles (which appears difficult) or do you buy a 2nd print head assembly which is pretty easy to swap in/out when you want to change between 0.35 and 0.5?","you won't get stuck, it's really very simple. all you need is an adjustable and a spanner or another adjustable. a big one to hold the hot end still, smaller one to grab the nozzle. after taking folament out the hot end, get nozzle to 165 c, undo it, don't let it drop on the bed so put something on top of the bed in case it drops, but do the final few turns with pliers or vice grips etc that will hold it when it comes totally loose. 

get new nozzle, hand tighten it in a few turns (takes 10/15 seconds to get hot so don't rush, but don't try and get it in on the end of a tool, the threads are soft and the leverage from the end of a tool will still make it feel real easy even if it's not going in straight) then use the tool to tighten it up. once it gets near fully screwed in, get your torque wrench, set it to the correct setting, tighten it up. if you use a crows foot adaptor don't forget to adjust accordingly. then heat it up to 230/240, use the torque wrench again. switch off the heat, let it all cool down, heat it back up, add filament, print.

really the only thing that can go wrong is either screwing the new nozzle in at a bad angle and cross threading or overtightening and stripping the threads. 

if you're going to find yourself swapping nozzles regularly i'd absolutely recommend the e3d v6 nozzles, they're a hex shape so can fit a socket over them which makes the whole process so much easier."
lulzbot v2 hot end w/ stainless steel or other high quality nozzle?,"i'm interested in a lulzbot v2 (hexagon) hot end with an installed nozzle which is chrome plated or perhaps stainless steel. 

i've heard that the bronze nozzle can wear out if you use some types of filament. i'm also interested in reducing lead (from the bronze nozzle) in prints that i'd like to be food safe (petg material).

i've seen that some people have installed 3rd party nozzles, but i don't want to void my warranty on my nearly brand-new taz 5 and/or break stuff. 

the taz 5 works so well, i don't want to mess it up!  ","i had to send an extruder in for repair. the hotend fan had failed and caused a heat creep jam. a bad one! in the process of trying to clear that jam, one of the thermistor wires broke. they repaired the problems and returned the toolhead to me with my non-stock 0.4mm nozzle installed. so, at least in that case, the nozzle swap did not void the warranty. 

now, if you swap a nozzle, do not tighten it properly and leak plastic all over your hotend, the repair might be on you. the worst case is that you would need to purchase a new hotend... not a big deal."
temp swings 8 deg.,"i am having an issue where the nozzle temp swings 8-10 degrees (4 up, 4 down). it does this over and over again. the printer is seemingly unable to reach a steady state. it doesn't do this all the time, but it is frequent.  is this normal?

thank you for your thoughts!
j","the pid tuning made a huge difference.  

for the print i am doing in pla i wanted the fan at 100%. i've alwyas found that with the fan set that high, the hotend barely has the power to hold temps. you know what? i did the pid tune while the fan was cranked to 100% and then put the values in the start script just for that temp/fan/print speed(volume of filament through the hot end can also affect temps) combo. it gets to steady state pretty quickly now, and stays dead-on except in circumstances when the extrusion volume changes dramatically etc... then, it regains steady state pretty quickly.  i highly reccommend pid tuning.

taz5 heatbed thermal view,"recently, i got my hands on a thermal camera from flir, model t420, and i thought about checking the uniformity of the heat on the bed. so i heat up the bed in three, most common for me, temps, waited for the system to stabilize and took the following three thermal pictures:

and here is a digital picture of the assembly





on the thermal pictures, the crosshair pinpoints the coldest spot within the bracketed area, while the rainbow bar on the right of the photo describes the measured temperature range of the entire photo.
it's obvious that the glass performs quite poorly with regard to the heat surface distribution, especially with the center, the top-left quadrant and all the corners.","i used a camera i borrowed from my job and it was recently calibrated. i understand that not every bed is the same even within the same product line.
but if you take a closer look at my thermals, you'll see that at 60c, the temperature sd3d.com also used, the gradient is not that bad. all differences magnify as the set temperature increases, something that sd3d.com didn't cover.
since i only have one taz5, i can't compare and know for sure whether my unit is the bad seed or not. but i do know that i should probably start looking for an aluminum bed plate, something that piercet has done successfully long time ago."

additional microswitches?,"would it be difficult (or inadvisable) to install additional microswitches for the end stops that don't have them, particularly the y axis? could you just tie the 2 together electrically?

with a microswitch in the way, you won't be able to move the bed past a certain point at all... maybe design a simple stop to bolt onto the z-axis.  regardless, here is the connectors on the rambo if you choose to go the way of a switch.  the y-min stop referenced by sebastian is middle-left of the board."

for anyone who may search the forums later looking for the same answer, what i did was, since i do not use a 2nd extruder (and likely won't), i hijacked the extruder 1 fan output, ran a wire down to the extruder, and tweaked the firmware to accept the p option on the m106/107 fan gcode. by capping the fan 'speed' to 120, it outputs 12v to the fan. pwm for the win."
retraction / bubbles,"printing in pla, i've noticed that shortly after a retraction (a few seconds later), i hear a little air bubble pop/snap sound. it leaves a tiny litle pit on the print. the sound and pit are very similar to the problem you might face using damp filament. this though is totally dry, and it only happens shortly after retractions.  has anyone else noticed retractions introducing air into the nozzle? if so, any tips?

this is a close-up detail. these are .25mm layers.




","i guess your retraction length is set too high. then air will come between the molten filament in the heat chamber and the solid section you are retracting. during unretract, the air gets trapped as bubbles in the molten area and finally into your print. 
with pla you don't need much retracting. values between 0.7 and max 1.5mm should be enough."
dual extruder knocking normal?,"i just got my replacement flexydually v2 and am printing the keychain. sometimes when head 1 is extruding the ninjaflex, the extruder gears knock as seen in this video. is that normal?

extruder temp malfunction,"i've had no issues with my setup for the last 4 months. today, while figuring out some janky issues with some matterhacker pla, i ran into a weird problem...

the temp for this pla is 230c (that threw me off, as pla is usually 205-220.). so after messing around for some time, finally got it (mostly) dialed. set the print in motion, and about 30 minutes into the print, the temp of the head dropped, almost instantly, to 213c. i couldn't get it to rise. it bounced between 213-218c for about another 30 min. then, it restabilized to 230c. it's been holding for the last hour.

the only difference is that during the drop, it was printing a flat area about 4"" radius. it seemed to stabilize when it started printing the walls (think; planter container).

this is the first time the temp ever wavered. is this a sign of impending failure of the thermister or heat unit?","first, i sent lulzbot support an email on a sunday morning...and they responded within an hour!! that's nuts! and great customer support.

extrusion problem with dual extruder v2,"hello everyone, i'm having some problem with my taz 5 with a dual extruder v2. 

i've had successful prints before, however recently it seems i just can't get it to print correctly. the back extruder would always extrude maybe just the first and second layers and then the back extruder would seemingly get clogged. the next layer above would either be very thin or sometimes globby. i have no problem with the first extruder which extrudes pva. 


i've tried matterhackers white pla regular and pro editions, gizmo dorks and protoparadigm white pla and they all give me the same result. the extruder idlers are all at 5 mm between washers, i measured it out with a digital caliper. 
i've tried many cold pulls and i can see the light coming from the nozzle when the extruder is empty. 
i've tried setting the filament diameter to 3 mm from 2.85 mm. 
both extruder heads are leveled and seem to give the same amount of friction. 
tried moving the filament holder above the taz 5 to see if that fixed anything. 
it seems that the microblower and fans are working. 
tried setting fan to run with min 90% above .25 mm. 
tried temperatures from 190-220. 
tried with microsd and direct connection.

what would cause zits on curved walls only?,"i have a taz 5 and s3d. i am not sure if this issue is slicer related or hardware related.

i get perfectly clean straight walls on my prints, but curved walls have blemishes on them (from starting and stopping layers). i have cured these on straight walls using coasting and negative restart after retractions and they are perfection but on curved walls the blemishes remain.

is this some sort of issue with the hardware trying to drive 3 steppers at one time? x y and the extruder?","piercet wrote:billyd wrote:i just purchased an e3d v6 to test it out. 

i am not getting any zits on curved walls with this new extruder. the main difference between the taz hex and the e3d is the cooling above the hot end.

so that leads me to think the cooling above the hot end is the cause of the zits on curved walls. makes sense.

so you could go with a stronger cooling fan on the hex and perhaps that would fix the issue, if you don't want to replace the extruder.

my only gripe with the e3d is they limit you to 290-295 because the thermistor they use will fail above that. kind of silly. i suppose you could swap theirs out with the ntc 100k and get rid of that limitation.

an e3d fixed it???? what the heck? 
i suppose there is a reduction in flow in a curve, so it almost has to either be cooling, or inner surface polish of the bore.  i have a 40mm fan on my hexagon already so it should be getting plenty of air, and the thermal camera seems to think the fins are staying cool, so i'm wondering if it is the bore polish then. i guess it's time to buy an e3d v6.

did you have to make any firmware changes, or is it just plug and play?

well you need to print a different layer fan duct because the extruder sits lower than the hex, but you can get that on thingverse. also i had to design a ""washer"" to sit between the top of the e3d housing and the base of the printed extruder housing because otherwise it is loose on the aluminum bracket. or you can buy a different aluminum bracket but the washer is easy and cheap. i can post the stl if you want it. you can also print a plastic bracket to replace the aluminum. frankly you can get away with that with the e3d because it's not even warm to the touch on the cold side of the extruder. i am very impressed with their extruder cooling design. much better than the hex. although the temp is limited to 290-295 on the e3d as i mentioned. but that is easily addressed with a different thermistor (a few dollars).

as far as firmware goes i just had to rerun the optimization for the hot end. they said to change the thermistor setting but my .h file was already set to what i should change it to. there are instructions on the upgrade on matterhackers website and there is a wiki for assembling the extruder itself (it's easy and much cheaper to buy the extruder kit). do a google for e3d v6 taz 5 installation. just beware matterhackers links to the wrong e3d v6 version. it should be 3mm direct drive and 24v. i'm sure you know that though. they don't though lol.

ps i completed my design for 12mm x rod upgrade and installed it today. fantastic! i have less than .1mm sag in x now. a huge improvement. i am just running my first print with a .1mm layer height and the first layer was perfection. i am so happy. i will post the stl's on thingverse and post a thread here when i get the chance."
inconsistent heat bed question,"my taz5 is only 5 months old, and i've been noticing inconsistencies in adhesion. i also had an issue with my capacative auto leveler. i was wondering if the leveling issue was due to heat, so i borrowed an infrared heat gun/thermemeter/whatever it's called.

in the area where my capacative leveler would not get a good read (not sure if it's coincidence), when the heat bed is set to 60 degrees for pla, the bed is about 60 degrees. everywhere else, it's about 10 degrees higher.

thats as you look at the bed. looks like the hot areas are right at/over  the main hookups for the bed.

is this normal? is my bed malfunctioning? i'm sure the capacative thing has to be a coincidence, a 10 degree difference shouldnt throw the reading off that much (at all?), but for sure i'm having adhesion issues when the center of my bed is 10 degrees cooler than the rest of it.","the left hand edge of the heated bed where the wires enter it isn't heated. the center itself should be heated, but thats also the smallest of the heat coils. it's possible the coil that feeds the middle of the bed has damaged itself. you can see the coil pattern itself here:

what's causing this?,"good morning everyone, i am in need of some help with my lulzbot taz 5.  i am having an issue printing objects.  i have tried printing objects and it always seems to mess up on overhangs even when support is turned on in cura.  the current system i am using is a lulzbot taz 5 with the dual extruder v2.   i am using cura 18.04 as well.  i have attached photos of my latest print and the settings i used as well.  any help with this would be greatly appreciated!","those issues with overhangs are difficult to cure... well becuase you're essentially printing on air in some of the instances.  so the key is to find the right extrusion temp and cooling mix to ensure the the extruded material solidifies quickly, and more importantly where you want it.

i'm not an avid user of cura, but the following should help with overhangs:
- print at lowest extrusion temp possible while maintaining adhesion to previous layer and adjacent extrusion.
- apply / increase cooling.  not necessarily at 100%, but enough to help solidify the extrusion where its deposited.
- slow down the print.  this will almost always improve surface quality.
- infill overlap, try increasing a bit... my need to lower flow rate to compensate.
- increase the wall thickness to ensure number of perimeters outlines... consider making the thickness a multiple of your extrusion width (ie, 1.5mm for a .5 extrusion width should yield 3 perimeter outlines vs 1.5mm for .6 extusion width yielding 2.???) for better control.

keep in mind that each of those parameters can influence the other.  for instance, cooling should be less when slowing down a print otherwise the extruded filament could harden too quickly without bonding to the previous layer or extrusion.  lower extrusion temp could benefit from less cooling.  

don't make too many changes at once... you'll never know what helped the print.

hope that helps... sorry i don't have a ""silver bullet"" to remedy."
heat set inserts...,"where can i find the heat set inserts that the taz uses and a howto on their use?

tnx!

g.","i use a cheap radio shack soldering iron. just file down the tip so it just barely fits the insert.
just a note if you are considering taking a file to your soldering iron -
the tips are composed of and coated with with different metals. i believe that the outer layer is iron.
filing this thin layer off will ruin your iron for normal soldering.
a tip that has been filed like this will deteriorate very quickly.
this isn't a big deal if you are dedicating your iron to this purpose, but you should otherwise treat your tips with care.
you can purchase a tip cleaner that is made from ""brass wool"". this will clean the tip without damaging it.
you can also clean it with a damp sponge. never sand, scrap, or file your tips..... (c8

taz4 flexydually v2,"i am setting up my taz 4 for the flexydually version 2 and was curious about the extruder fan plug in. can i follow the instructions for installing the second extruder wiring from the taz 5 assembly here: https://ohai.lulzbot.com/project/c8d163 ... 8cca5d62c/

then when i update the firmware tell cura i am using a taz 5 flexydually with the hexagon hot ends?

-joe","somewhat, that is where i started at least. i am curious about the second hot end (e1) fan connection to the rambo. there are a couple really good of guides for setting up the primary extruder (e0) for a hexagon hot end, (ohai.lulzbot.com, and xrobots.co.uk), but sadly my searches showed nothing for the second. from the taz 5 instructions it looks like the second blower fan plugs into the 2 pins on the bottom row furthest to the right. i am just not 100% certain that is correct.

taz 5 printer is hanging mid print.,"this is the first problem that i have had with the printer so far, i have printed several 5-6 hour prints without any issue. i am using cura - 18.03 and have firmware; 2015q3 

i have tried printing this part twice now, i am printing off the sd card using the controller menu. the first time it stopped about 3 hours into the print and this time it stopped about 2.5 hours in. the menu on the controller is still usable and i tried to pause and restart print without any luck. i double checked and none of the cura plugins were active and i was using the abs fine print profile off the lulzbot site.

i was wondering if anyone has seen this issue or has found a remedy for this problem.

thanks.","i am having the same issue.

some parts print from the sd card - no problem - but every other part or so seem to cause the printer to stop working and move the bed to the y limit.

screens says it's printing, and all the temps are stable/online.

no really common things to point to why it does it.

however, if i take the exact same gcode/stl and run it though the pc to print, works everytime.

i have made gcode with cura (latest) and s3d (latest) and both times failed, re-print with the actual program sending the gcode - no issues.

i have formatted my sd card - waiting till friday to get a new one to try that.

i thought it may be caused by having spaces in the folder names on the sd card.   i made one called ""to print"" - gcode failed.
changed the folder to ""to_print"" - gcode worked - but when i tried to make another print, using the same gcode, it failed!"
setup question - new taz + new flexydually,"i'm receiving my replacement taz 5 today and received the flexydually v2 last thursday. unfortunately my month old taz completely died when printing the calibration squares for the flexydually, so it's being replaced. i've printed almost 1kg of abs since i received my first taz, so this was kind of strange and a surprise for it to just die like that.

should i set up taz using the single extruder and do initial leveling with that or can i just skip it and mount the flexydually? is leveling very difficult with a dually installed? i'd rather not use the single extruder if i don't need to.","after fiddling with the dual extruder v2 for the last month+, i'd say its safe to mount the flexydually and establish nozzle height.  well, the consideration is that it will be your primary toolhead on the machine.  since putting the dual extruder on, i haven't gone back to the single extruder.

here's how i'd do it:
- follow the directions to install the dual extruder... specifically there's a bolt that needs to be replaced on the left side of the machine.
- flash the firmware
- raise the z endstop so that the nozzle doesn't crash into your bed.
- level the bed.
- move the toolhead to the center of the bed, heat up tool0.
- home the z, increment z-enstop... repeat until you can get a business card between the nozzle and bed.  use tool0 (back extruder) for all actions.
- once you can slip the business card through with some resistance, the iniitial nozzle gap should be about right.  it may need to be lowered by half a turn of the z-endstop to get a smooth bottom on the object... but also have atool handy to remove the print.
- at this point, you can try to level tool1 or continue to a calibration cube to check out the bottom surface.
- let's do the print the claibration cube... i use the attached 20x20x5mm cube.  cancel print at 1.5mm to check out the bottom for nozzle gap calibration.  the bottom should be fairly smooth and just able to make out the individual extrusion lines.
-  adjust z as necessary.
-  level tool1 so the bottom of the calibration cube looks the same as the one printed on tool0.  on my dual extruder, i can see ~3 threads on the insert. more threads means the nozzle is farther away from the bed... less means nozzle closer to bed.

last tip, i use the attached calibration ring to check that the bed is level.  again, look at the finish on the bottom of the ring to determine if any corner is lower than the others.  i also like to use dial gauges to quantify the distance of each corner... one on either side of the toolhead.

hope this helps!  post some cool prints with the flexydually... or just post a print.  "
sporadic x axis stepper motor,"i've been looking through all the previous forums that outline issues with x or y axis stepper motors.

after completing a series of 24+ hour builds - i started one today that during the first couple of layers had issues with what i thought was belt slippage https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/920 ... 124609.jpg.  i re-tensioned the x axis belt to closely match the y axis tension.  since all issues appear to be in the x axis.

after tensioning the belt - the issue persisted, so i disassembled the extruder from the mount, and removed the bearings to ensure there was no build up of dirt/debris on the them.  wiped down the rails and bearings and re-assembled.

still nothing.  i feel as though i've got the belts tight enough, i may go back through and attempt to tighten further as when i mark the belt to examine slippage after moving x direction +300 -300 +300 there is about a 1/2"" misalignment.

using pronterface i recorded a few videos showing the movement, and inconsistent speed of the stepper during movement.  

videos:
https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/920 ... 123217.mp4


a newly discovered issue is that when the steppers are energized - i'm able to move the x axis fairly easily....


any help would be greatly appreciated, i'm running out of ideas...","it looks like you either have a stepper motor electrical short on two of the 4 leads to that motor, or the belt pulley itself is slipping intermittently. or it could be some other electrical issue. but i'd check the connectors and cables, especially for a pin slipping out of the housing."
is there a way to put a dual extruder fan on the taz5,i have a taz5 with a e3d v6 hotend.  one of the modifications i want to do is add a second extruder fan on the other side of carriage plate.  what are my options?,"piercet wrote:the 6 has an x maximum endstop as well as the x minimum endstop found on all previous taz units. i believe the cutout allows clearance for that actual endstop switch, which mounts off the right hand side fan somehow.  you can see it here: https://ohai.lulzbot.com/project/taz-6- ... bly/taz-6/ 

the taller extruder bodies, if you are using my variants, should fit that extruder without too much difficulty. it's possible that the carriage mount guide socket is up too high, or you may need to trim some off of the end of the new taz 6 extruder carriage mounting tab. how far off is it? you can also bore out the bolt hole slightly with an m3 drill if it is pretty close. there is alot of meet there, so it won't weaken the structure if you don't take very much off.

that makes a lot of sense now.  can you send me a link to your version of the extruder body?"
how do you clean taz 5 nozzle regularly?,"i feel as if too much filament is starting to get stuck on the tip of my taz 5 nozzle. i know the mini has some sort of cleaning accessory so i was wondering is there supposed to be daily cleaning of the print head exterior and underneath? how is this done?

also should a nozzle be removed and cleaned out inside regularly?

thanks,
chris","i clean my nozzles with the following method.

heat the hotend to printing temp.
put on leather gloves.
fold up an old cotton washcloth to make a thick pad.
wipe the hot nozzle vigorously with the dry wash cloth.

if it needs a little extra cleaning, i use a blue scotch brite pad.

the extruded filament should drop straight out of the nozzle. if it is curling at all, you have a partial blockage inside or right at the tip. these types of blockages can sometimes be cleared by raising the hotend temp and extruding plastic. if that doesn't work, i use a drill bit smaller than the nozzle size to clear the orifice. i just heat the hotend to printing temps and gently insert the bit into the nozzle, move it up and down a few times then extrude more plastic. repeat as necessary. using this method, i have not needed to remove a nozzle for several months."
extruder calibration,"we have a new taz 5 that we got at the beginning of the week.  one of our plans for this machine is to print out some check gauges and calibration jigs for parts.  since we want the maximum available resolution and precision from this machine, we've been going through some of the calibration tutorials online.  

we decided to try to dial in the extruder first, since that seems like it can affect the x, y, and z calibrations.  our first trials were done extruding 30mm, and trying to measure things with a simple scale.  we weren't able to get anything that seemed even reasonable this way.

our second trial is done using a set of digital calipers.  we set them to 120.00mm and lock them, then position them above the extruder head and mark the filament with a razor knife.  next, we use pronterface to extrude 100mm of filament, then use the calipers to measure the height of the cut, using the razor knife as a guide.  if everything was working perfectly, we would measure 20.00mm every time.

we're seeing very inconsistent numbers.  here's the data from this morning:
trial 1: 18.76 mm
trial 2: 19.57 mm
trial 3: 20.04 mm
trial 4: 20.21 mm
trial 5: 19.58 mm

has anybody else tried this and gotten better results?  is this as good as we can get?  btw: we've got the extruder rate set to 100 mm/min.  

thanks for any tips.","gleblanc wrote:coparatech wrote:here are  couple of links to the recommended methods for setting your extruder calibration:

https://ohai.lulzbot.com/project/extrud ... libration/

http://reprap.org/wiki/triffid_hunter's ... tion_guide

the ohai guide says to set extrusion speed at 100, but it is recommended to use a normal speed or 30-40 for more accurate results.

well, we ran some more tests, and they're slightly more consistent.  we changed our default marking length from 120mm to 60mm, and our feed test from 100mm to 50mm, because it seemed like we were introducing significant measurement error through the bending of the filament.  we ran some more tests at 30mm/min feed rate, and got 10.08, 10.08, 9.73, 9.74.  so it seems like maybe that is as accurate as we're going to be able to get with this equipment.

i'll run some more calibration samples tomorrow, and see what the results look like.

  i have dealt with and used machinist measuring gauges and i don't think your going to get a 3d printer, printing plastic to make gaging blocks with great accuracy. and if you did get one you wanted, the plastic expands and contacts with moisture and temperature over time."
z couplers,i am in the process of using piercet anti z wobble and i was wondering about the z coupler. i notice that there are 3d printed parts that are used for the z coupler while there are those who uses the stock z coupler that taz came with. are there any difference at all? i read about the coupler called oldham coupler and spider coupler. would those affect the quality of the print?,"the taz 4, 5 and 6 have fully constrained leadscrews, which means there is a top and bottom bearing preventing the leadscrew from flopping around on its own, and more importantly the coupler is not improperly acting as a z height restraint device like it does on so many other printers.  that means you could actually use a different coupler type, and there are theoretically better ones out there. 

aluminum spring couplers such as the taz uses are fairly stiff, but at an exagerated physics level you can think of them like a slinky. rapidly turn a slinky at its base, and there will be a slight delay as that motion works its way through the coils and rotates the top to match. in the case of the taz, that motion is over such a small spring and occurs so quickly its likely not perceptable to the final print at all. a zero backlash spider coupler on the other hand would theoretically have less of that motion, but again its so small that you probably won't even notice it. a spider coupling is however more forgiving of motor misallignment to the shaft than a coil coupling, which can reduce issues in printers not running an anti wobble in theory. the tricky part is finding one that will fit the taz motors and leadscrews that isn't rediculously tiny and weak looking. i'll give you a hint in that regard, all of the ones on mcmaster carr that will fit are puny. 

printed ones can work, but in this application the helical coil couplers are likely a superior choice."
is it supposed to do this?,"













i was printing a netfabbed stl. everything looked fine. i left the room for a few hours to come back to this. it must have failed just after i walked away. the printer is only 3 months old.","i was printing a hollow cylinder with one end closed off by a rough diagonal plane. this stl file was checked with netfabb. unfortunately i can not upload the gcode (file is too large but it can be downloaded from here) but i have attached the stl of the model we were trying to print. 

as far as i can tell from the print it seems to have decided to ignore the commands to increase the z height after the first ~2cm of the model. the g-code itself seems fine as far as i can tell (i have checked it in a gcode viewer, and manually looked to check that z is increased at each new layer).

we are currently waiting to speak to lulzbot support (they are not open at the moment). looking closer at the broken extruder mount, it snapped in line with the hotend bolts. 

where as i agree that you should sit with the printer at all times, this isn't always practical. this print was supposed to take 12 hours. i'd sat with the printer for the first two hours and it was fine. it's just unlucky that it seems to have failed right after i left the room. however i would hope that a failed print wouldn't destroy the printer itself.

installation x/y home issue,"just put together our new taz 5.  homed the x & y and the print nozzle ended up above the corner clip on the bed (would have run into it if i hadn't raised it in the z axis).  the quick start instructions do not seem to cover homing x or y,  should we hit ""motors off"" and turn the axis to shift the home position away from the bed clips (which the head will bash into if the z is at home level)?","tisnothing wrote:i was thinking of turning the motors off and rotating the motors until it was away from the corner clip.  loosening the screws & shifting the bed seems more drastic- do you think that's the answer? and why doesn't anyone else seem to need to do this (it's not in the manual)? but thanks so much for the quick answer!!

chris","i'd find one that sits on rollers also... keeps the unspooling filament from getting out of the spool and wrapping around the center rod.  the downfall of that type alone is that the spool gets too light towards the end and gets off track.  hence the usefulness of the center rod.

problems with new taz 5 printer,"thanks in advance for all any help you can offer.

i just got a taz 5 printer and i have had nothing but problems and i was wondering if someone could point me in the right direction before i pack this back up in the box it came in.

i have two major issues i am running into.

the first is extrusion related.  when i am attempting any print with fine details (the first one i ran into this on was the rocktopus, but so far i have had it with everything that has a narrow or thin vertical piece) the printer simply stops extruding once it gets past the thick parts.  it still moves around like it is extruding, but nothing at all comes out.  i tried pausing the print and hitting the extrude button and after a bit it does extrude, but it is half the amount i would expect.  if i hit extrude again it is back to the normal amount.  

my thought was that it was simply not extruding enough so i tried upping the flow, but it did not seem to help.  should i try upping it more or is there something else i should try here?


the second issue is the more serious one.  my z axis does not stay level, the right hand side seems to lower during printing.  the first time i noticed this was when i tried to print my first thing other than the bed tests (a rocktopus that is where i first noticed the above issue).  at about 95% done the printer made a sort of growling sound so i quickly hit stop on the print.  when i was testing everything to see if it worked i was able to move it on the x and y axis, but the z would not move.  i then noticed that the right hand side was a good 4mm or so lower than the left.  after i got them lined back up the axis started moving so i figured it was just a one time thing.  now i have noticed that every time i use the printer by the time it messes up on the print (due to the first issue) it is again out of alignment.  every time the right hand side is lower than the left.  so i correct it and start a new print and find the same issue 30 minutes later.

any suggestions on these two issues, or is my printer just a lemon?  i have only had it for a week now, but so far it has been nothing but frustration.

this can be the result of too much twist of the x carriage on the z threaded rods, but also the z nut bolts may have a small tilt on them. there is a guide to align the z nuts and x carriage, but i do not remember where it is any more. but i believe it is part of the kit taz ohai, or at least when i reworked the last few returned kit taz i saw it there.

designing an experiment for taz 5 heated bed,"i am working on an experiment to determine how variable your print's quality will be based on where it is on the printing bed. we have a few of these printers at my university and over time they have started to show some issues with certain areas of the bed. i am conducting a research project to identify whether or not the location on the bed where the print takes place is of concern. 

we have 3 taz 5's and at this point i need to develop three levels for my analysis. for these levels i will need to figure out how variable the temperature across the bed can be based on the input temp and break the 300 x 300 mm plate into 3 distinct areas where the temperature would be noticeably different. i know the plate is borosilicate glass and i have found the thermal conductivity for the material, however i am assuming the heater is designed to be extremely uniform with the grid like pattern. 

as i have researched information on the plate but i cannot find how the plate is heated. i have found the heating element available on the lulzbot site but is the heating through the grid channels totally uniform? i am assuming it is hard to heat up a rectangle uniformly, that's why pizzas are round.","there is an infrared image of the taz heated bed that shows the conductor pattern pretty well floating around somewhere in google image search. it's basically a series of concentric rectangles, with no heater loop right at the cable connection point. the middle does tend to be hotter on a glass bed. an aluminum bed will heat more evenly to the edge. images of that in infrared exist in this forum. 

the other issue you will see is the apparent hump in the bed center. it is actually flat, but the droop due to gravity of the extruder and the bed results in an apparent high spot. the fixed is stronger rods or boxed rails. without modifications though, your adhesion success will be lower at the edges than the center."
taz 5: can fan be used on high temp prints?,"i've been troubleshooting an issue for many days with lulzbot support:  when printing at 260c with the fan on (100%), the hotend temperature is dropping by around 15c.  this ruins the layer adhesion of my material.

can any other taz 5 owners verify that the hotend should be able to maintain its temperature at this level even with the cooling fan on?","the simple answer is to run the fan at less than 100%. pretty easy to do. either do it in cura, or you can turn down the fan manually on the lcd display on the printer, but you will have to do it every time if you chose the manual method.

the more complicated answer is to replace the standard 24v 30 watt heater with a 24v 40 watt heater. you may (or may not) have to re-tune the pid parameters after swapping out the heater. 
here is one on ebay:

taz 5 calibration off,"i'm hoping someone might be able to point me in the right direction on this one.

i have a taz 5 that has been working flawlessly for the last several months.  recently halfway through a print it  started to 'shift' the print to one side, almost as if the print had been moved on the bed midway through.  since then it has not been able to reliably print anything.  when i run the configuration stl file i get what you see in the picture below.

all of the belts appear to be taught.  i have reloaded the firmware (2015q2), verified the x,y,z,e steps are all correct.  any suggestions would be appreciated.




","one last question.  if i move the x-axis carriage by hand, shouldn't it move fairly smoothly?  mine is not.  it's definitely tough to move, and not consistent in the amount of pressure needed.  definitely harder to move than the bed on the y-axis.  i'm thinking that might point to either the bearings or the stepper motor.

calling it a night.  i've triple checked the pulley, it's definitely not slipping.  as far as i can tell i don't think the belt is jumping over any teeth either.  have also tried printing at different locations on the bed to see if there was some issue with the rods themselves.

anyway, thanks for all of your help tonight. much appreciated.  maybe a fresh set of eyes tomorrow will find something."
adhesion nightmares,"i have a new taz 5 and am having no end of difficulty getting a descent print.  after the initial rockapus went well, bed adhesion has been terrible.  here are some observations:
- my first abs prints stuck so hard they were extremely difficult to get off.
- now, nothing seems to stick at all.  
- i have tried cleaning with ipa.  
- i have tried painters tape and glue stick.  
- failures occur with both abs and pla, with brim and without.  
- i have tweaked the z-stop, checking for the double-paper 
- my prints start well, but reach a certain height and then start sliding around.  
- sometimes they stick to the extruder, which due to printing disasters, now has filament melted on the outside. 
- i tried a new, clean print head.  no help.  
- i have not yet changed the one-month old pei sheet, but that is next on the list of things to try.","i have found my experience isn't as positive as other with pei. my ooze has never just ""stuck"". i think my pei just isn't as sticky as others. however i've gotten it to work with perfect part adhesion every time. 

i'm going to save you a lot of headache and weeks (months?)  of misery. 

go buy 2000 grit sand paper. sand the living crap out of your pei bed. put some elbow grease in it. you won't hurt the bed because the sand paper will lose its coarseness before you ever do. honestly i do this every few prints. 

what i've found is that when a part stick overly well (which is what happened to you)  you lose a significant amount of stick. nothing will bring it back but a good amount of sanding. (i believe it's due to plastic getting overly smashed into the pei pores) 

i know this from personal experience. i go over over stick on my long 15 hour prints. the parts i print need to have perfect bed adhesion and honestly aren't easy parts to print/stick. thus i over stick them. thus i lose stickiness on my bed more than others. thus i sand more than others. 

also i've found anything less than 90 percent ipa isn't worth your time. the diluted stuff doesn't cut through the leftover residue. 

sand then clean with ipa. 

also the thickness of 1 sheet of paper still seems to tall.  i do everything by visual sight. i print a line and then adjust the z height. i keep. lowering it until i see tracking? treading? (the wagon wheel effect) and then i slowly raise the z nut until just barely where i don't see it. make sure you're doing this at the center of your plate."
x-axis 12mm upgrade for taz 5. no more sag!,"just finished installing 12mm rods on my taz 5 x-axis. i believe they are incorporating 12mm rods on the taz 6 (although differently than i did it). the reason to increase to 12mm rods is to reduce the sag that occurs (worst at the center of x travel) as the extruder moves in x. the weight of the extruder and carriage causes the stock 10mm rods to deflect too much under the weight. the deflection is significant with respect to the tight tolerances required for nozzle to build bed distance. we typically aim for .1 to .2mm gaps between the bed and the nozzle. the stock 10mm x axis sags more than this amount on my machine. this makes the nozzle either too close to the bed at the center of x travel, or too far away at the extreme ends of x travel.

by doing this upgrade i was able to remove almost all of the sag. my total sag is now less than .1mm through the full range of x travel. this results in a much easier to achieve excellent first layer. it also allows for less trouble when printing wide parts.

the upgrade is a fair amount of work, as you'll have to remove the extruder, carriage, old bearing holders behind the carriage, the x rods, and the aluminum mounting plates at each end of the travel. the work is not difficult, but a little time consuming. you'll have to increase the clearance holes in the aluminum mount plates, for each rod, to 13mm. but actually the worst part of the job was reclaiming all the heat set inserts from the stock printed parts lol. anyway this upgrade is extremely worth it.

you'll need to print one of each of the attached stl's before you begin. print them with at least 85% infill.

you'll need to order qty 3: lmu12, as well as qty 2: psfu12-500 shafts from misumi

then it's just a matter of replacing all the stock prints with the new ones and replacing the stock 10mm rods and bearings with the stuff from misumi you ordered. all the other hardware from the stock taz can be reused. and there is no functional difference between any of the components. no firmware change and no change in how the printer operates, except for greatly improved first layers and easier leveling.

enjoy! if you have any questions please ask.

ps you'll see piercet's antiwobble design in the photos too, that is a separate upgrade and i highly recommend that one as well. but it is not required for changing to 12mm. sorry for any confusion that causes.









","i'm going to put this onto my taz5.

but i don't want to remove the heat inserts from the existing plastic components, so i can keep those intact in case i need to go back to the original.

and i'm a newbie with heat inserts.  i've used the forum to find a link to mcmaster carr ( http://www.mcmaster.com/#heat-inserts/=11vvt3a ), but i don't know what size and length are needed for these parts.  for example, are any m3 3.8mm long? 

at around $10/bag, i'd rather not order things i don't need.  should i just get the short m3, m4, and m5?

if you did happen to know what different sizes heat inserts are needed, i'd greatly appreciate it.  
my other idea is to inspect the current parts and try to figure out, or look at lulzbot documentation website.

thanks very much"
random wait for user input,"has anybody experienced a problem where the taz5 will randomly pause the job and ""wait for user input"".  the job resumes from the lcd panel, however while it is waiting it just sits there and melts a spot in the model.  there is no m00 or m01 in the gcode and no plugins are enabled.  i can run the same model over again with different results. it may do it zero, one, or more times.  it is happening more and more frequently and occurs most often on the first layer.  i am wondering if it is getting some erroneous sensor value that is causing it to wait for input?

i am not doing anything special.  i have stock firmware for a single extruder.  i am printing with cura using the stock abs medium profile.  i see it most often on big models where it should have been printing overnight, but instead is just sitting there.","hi everyone,
i am a new lulzbot user and i am experiencing this same problem. i have a stock taz5 running marlin 2015q3 and using cura lulzbot edition 18.03 connected with a usb cable to a computer running windows7. i have not tested with any other slicer or printer host software.

i have been printing round the clock, without major problems since i received the printer about 7 weeks ago. the first time i experienced this was on a part 250mm long in the x-axis, the printer stopped on infill of the first layer, just after finishing a long x-axis run. i then turned the part 90 degrees and it printed fine. today, printing a similar part, also 250mm long, this time in the y-axis, it stopped on infill of the fourth layer, just after finishing a long y-axis run. after reading this forum today, i checked the g-code and there are no m0 or m1 commands. 

can anyone tell me if this problem has been solved? 

in “http://download.lulzbot.com/software/cura/packages/ “there is a version 18.04-67db. should i install this version of cura?

lastly i am just speculating on something i really know nothing about: since the cura lulzbot edition is based on the ultimaker version, and the ultimaker has a printbed that is smaller than 250mm. can there be any relation to this problem?"
removing z-axis coupling,"i recently go the astrosyn dampers and started installing them on my taz 5. they went on the x and y axes no problem and work amazingly. hit the wall trying to remove the coupling for the z axis. i've given a few full rotations loosening three of the set screws, the other seems like it was stripped or like something is stuck inside the top, they hex key doesn't go in at all. i was unable to remove the coupling from either the threaded rod or the stepper shaft. there was also what seemed to be a lubricant coming out of the set screw holes as i worked on them.

has anyone encountered such a problem? any recommendations to get around this? i really don't want to start drilling these things out and having to replace the couplings, if not more. thanks in advance.","i have a similar problem with a coupler on my mini.  all the grub screws on the right-hand axis had some kind of white material (thread lock perhaps?) in them. i was able to get that out using the dental pick.

but the problem didn't end there.  one of the grub screws' hex recess is stripped out.  on another,  the top portion of the grub screw (the portion with the hex recess) is completely gone, like it was over-torqued and broken off during assembly.  i can only assume ao had a gorilla installing couplers that day.   

not sure what to do next.  if i drill them out, i'll likely ruin the coupler threads in the process -- and haven't found a good source for the misumi 16x5x5 couplers that ao used."

is the juniperbush folder where all of the taz 5 files are kept?,is the juniperbush folder where all of the taz 5 files are kept?,"devel.lulzbot.com is where the development files live. download.lulzbot.com is where the production files live. the development files are named after things as codenames. taz tend to be named after trees in alphabetical order. the latest taz 6 prototype is the olive folder. inside the various folders you will see production parts, design files, documents, and production gcodes.  in some cases you will see ao- 101 or mini subfolders. this may indicate that a particular batch of parts was sliced to be produced on an ao-101 or a mini printer instead of a taz. sometimes smaller precision part batches benefit from less time on the heated bed (extruder gears for example).

a folder may also have different versions of a stl file. usually that indicates one version is a newer, more refined revision. sometimes there are stl files containing more than one copy of a part to make batch slicing faster (if you wanted to print a whole bed worth of idler latches for example) 

a gcode file is a pre sliced stl file in printer specific format. i could slice a stl for my modified taz that someone who had a mini would not be able to print due to the bed size and speeds. but i could come back and load that same gcode file on my printer and hit print without waiting to slice it again. generally you want to just slice the stl file unless you know where the gcode came from and that it is for your printer configuration."

help...extruder motor is working but no filament being extruded,"i am noticing that no filament is coming out of my print head. the extruder motor is turning etc but nothing is coming out. is this a clog? is the gear that pulls the filament screwed up? is there a writeup on how to clean head?

i was in the middle of a print and i noticed the printer stopped dead in its tracks and had been left there with the hot end on for 3 hours with ngen in it. what could this have caused?

thanks for you help....

chris","here's the steps i would take:

1. open the filament clamp that holds it against the hobbed bolt. heat the nozzle up to appropriate temperature for your material and try to manually extrude the filament by pushing it into the nozzle. if you can extrude material then you don't have a clog most likely. 

2. if step 1 goes well, check your hobbed bolt to see if the valleys of the teeth are filled with filament. use your supplied pointy poker stick and wire brush to clean out the teeth.

3. check your clamp tightness to make sure there is enough force to allow the teeth to bite into the filament instead of spinning against the filament.

4. if you can't advance the filament manually in step 1, you probably have a clog and it will depend on your material you were printing how you proceed. most likely start with a cold pull (search the forums, there are good explanations of how to do it). if it was abs the nozzle can be removed and soaked in acetone. but that would be my last thing i do.

manual control of extruders via lcd,"i like running my taz without my computer attached, just from the sd card and lcd screen.  i can control everything i need to, except that i can't manually operate the extruder.  when i go to movement > 10 mm > extruder, it moves whichever extruder was activated last.  i can't select which extruder to use.  i like to do that to manually feed filament, retract, or whatever.

am i missing something?  or might this be added in a future firmware upgrade?","i have got to agree. is there a reason to exclude these features?  
two things to add to lcd control  
1.  move z axis in the same way x and y are moved.
2. extrude on demand. 

manually turning the wade gear is possible but certainly not the best option."
do we like the new v2 dual print head ?,"i was considering purchasing the new dual extruder print head v.2 and  i was wondering what everyone's experience with it is? i don't mind tinkering with it but i was curious as to how long the install and adjusting takes to get the thing working well? 

is the quality of the prints improved over v1? i really don't want to have to do any moding to it after spending $495 for it. 

you guys like it out of the box?

thanks,
chris","i've had mine for several months, and while i have gotten some good prints out of it, i am not a huge fan.

my main complaint is the weight, specifically that it is cantilevered out in one direction from the x-axis rods.  the rods are already undersized to begin with, the additional weight of the dual head causes problems.  it  would have been nice if the weight was at least centered on the x-axis rods.  (there is a fix - piercet's openrail mod, which i will eventually get to.  also i understand that the taz6 has bigger rods).

the problem is so bad that if, while you are aligning the head, you lift up on the front of the head and then let it back down, it will assume a new height.  it makes it difficult to consistently level the head front-to-back.

the other huge problem that i have run into is that while it will print pla pretty well for a while, eventually it will start to fail due to heat creep.  i don't know why it got worse over time, but it did, and with both extruders.  i don't believe the solution to this problem lies in more air across the existing heat sink; if you look at the thermal interface between the heatsink and the filament tube, you will see that the heat sink does very little to remove heat from the filament, and heat traveling up the filament is the basis for the heat creep problem (which is why it occurs most prominently with pla).  i added a second blower to the heat sink and it made no appreciable improvement to the heat creep problem.  i am currently testing another solution that looks very promising, i will share my results.

i think that if you  are seriously considering a dual head v2 you should also budget for the open rail mod on the x-axis.  if you are planning on printing with materials other than pla, you should be ok."

printer not printing.. maybe blockage?,"hi, 

so my taz 3 which has been working great seems to be jammed..? it just doesn't want to lay down filament. 

i remove the filament and can see it's all chewed up as if it's a jam. i'm able to force filament through manually by heating the head and pushing the filament through, so that's why i don't understand it.. if i can push the filament manually, then surely it's not blocked? is it possible that my gear that feeds the filament is worn out or something? i've also tried tightening the tension springs too.

also where can i get new heads from?","check the small gear setscrew. it can come loose and appear to try and turn the gear, but not actually extrude anything. also make sure there is about 8mm between the two washers on either side of the tension springs on the idler tension arms. it is quite possible the gear itself has worn out or cracked and isn't engaging the shaft properly too. 

the taz 3 was also the last version of the taz that didn't use sealed 608zz bearings on the extruder hobbed bolt and idler arm. make sure all three bearings still turn properly. if the idler bearing in particular is seized, you'll see a similar symptom."
so close. how to eliminate final flaw. abs print,"take a look. after adjusting my retraction and setting the spiral start point, my vase is close to perfection. how do i get rid of the final ""seam""?","switch to full settings. fill => perimeters before infill, check or uncheck as wanted.
but i guess there will be only a small or even no difference.. your start stop points are not too bad.

if you want to experiment and invest some time, i would try the following:
have a look at the wall thickness, could it be printet in one perimeter with your nozzle? if yes, you might try to slice it in two peaces: first, use spiral vase mode until the voronoi pattern starts. note that curas spiralize feature might be broken, there was a thread regarding a problem with it a few weeks ago.
than, slice the upper part without the vase mode and merge the gcode parts manualy. not the trivial way of printing, but interesting  "
x-axis bushings loose,"my fairly new taz 5 seems to have developed a looseness in the 3 bushings that support the x axis / extruder carriage. i am pretty sure this is then causing a wobble in the vertical surfaces of my prints. although, i suppose could be something else, like a z-axis screw being bent or binding. but the slop is pretty severe, maybe 1mm or so, which seems like it could cause all sorts of unevenness in prints.

i have a couple of sample octopus prints: the ivory one was the test print shipped with my printer. the white one is a recent print, slightly larger, where you can see the bands. (sorry for the blur).

i have the habit of pushing new filament through the extruder by hand to flush out the old color. i wonder if that has put too much force on the bushings and caused them to become loose.

thoughts?









","after contacting support, they thought it was z-axis binding and gave me a recalibration sequence to follow. that seemed to help, and produced the improved octo on the right of this new pic. (it doesn't look that much different in the pic, but does feel smoother)

i'm still curious as to how the loose bushings might be contributing to general unevenness in prints. and, could you point me to posts that describe the anti-wobble modifications? someday i might try the openrail upgrade, but first i'd like to try some simpler mods."

the bed leveling going out of level can be a couple things. check the z motor couplers, the small setscres can come loose and cause the leadscrews to fail to turn. once you are sure those are tight, on the flat spot of the shafts and locked down, then take your verneir calipers and measure from the bottom of the leadscrew nut to the top of the lower leadscrew bearing. the distance should be exactly identical on both sides. once that is correct, then heat your 3d printer nozzle to temperature, move it to each corner of the bed and use a thin metal feeler gauge to ensure that each corner of the bed is the same distance away from the nozzle. then adjust the main height adjustment screw as needed to get a proper leveling pattern when printing the bed level gcode.

odd stepper issue on y axis,"for a while now my taz5 would make a loud 'click' as the y axis moved forward and back. it was intermittent... middle of a print, it would start, then stop a few minutes later. sometimes before i had time to go check it.

the times it was clicking, i checked everything i could see. the click sounded like the bed was hitting something, like it was banging into something as it slid forward and back. but there was nothing in the way. the bed moved freely. maybe it was coming from the stepper? i don't know. my prints were fine, so, i didn't worry.

just now it was clicking and i went to check it. this time the print wasn't fine - my y axis slipped and everything was shifted off a few mm towards the front of the bed. dammit. ok, lets investigate. cancel print. turn motors off. move the bed and... the bed won't move. turn stepper off. again, again. steppers won't turn off. check x axis... that moves. manually turn extruder gear - it turns. move y axis - nope, it's locked.

ok, weird, lets totally power it off. the y still won't move.

turn it back on, connect, jog the y axis through the interface. it moves. power it off - won't move.

whats going on with my motor?

as a possibly related side note - the shaft on my x axis actually snapped in half inside the motor body 2 weeks ago. wasn't even stressing the printer, just doing normal prints at about 60 mm/sec. only bought the printer 2-3 months ago - was there possibly a batch with bad motors?

going to call support tomorrow and see what i can do about it, but in the mean time - why would my y axis motor bind up, even with the power off, but still move when printing? and of course, there's the clicking, and now the misprint...","there was a batch of bad motors with shafts that weren't properly hardened. most of them were in the mini line.

check the y motor pulley, if the setscrews are loose it could be moving on the shaft."
prints are not sticking well to pei (taz 5),"i dont get it, everyone else on the internet heralds pei as a miracle material. i personally cant get anything to stick well.

ive leveled and releveled my bed until i am blue. i've experimented with the z end stop and tried to mash the first layer down farther into the bed. i've cleaned and recleaned with isopropyl alcohol. i've even tried sanding the dang thing (lightly with 2000 grit). 

how are people complaining about parts sticking ""to well"". i'm pretty much forced to use a brim on every print and pray to the the 3d printing gods that it will stick.

i tried contacting technical support and they pretty much copy pasted the user manually to me and called it a day. i'm at my wits end and i'm about to send this thing back as i am still within my 30 day window. 

generally i am printing at 240c nozzle temp with a 110 bed temp. i saw lulzbots post about using 85 c bed temp... yeah right, nothing would even partially stick at that temp.

what initial layer heights does everyone use? i've tried going smaller but it seemed to stick even less. the preset 0.425 initial layer height seems to work best.","so i may have been slightly under extruding...  but it would have been minor seeing as all the upper layers if the print would turn out ok. 

i readjusting flow rate and changed the first layer width to 200 percent. this seemed to help but i'm still having issues with larger prints. 

i'm still getting curling on the edges/corners of large prints.  i'm using a make shift enclosure until i get my ""real"" one built. i've been hot boxing it with the cardboard box it came in (it gets really hot in there! i worry as the stepper motor burned my hand when i touched it... concerning but that is a different topic for another thread). anyways, i'm doing everything everyone says and i'm still having these issues.

one thing i have noticed is that the center of the bed gets hot...  almost to hot as i noticed the bottom few layers getting ""wavy""  (getting to hot i assume) in a 3""x3"" square. however it's this center part that sticks amazingly! it's only the stuff in the center of the bed that i can't get off until it cools (which is ideal!)  however it's just that small area in the center of the bed. 

has anyone else noticed this issue? i set my bed at 110c and i've already had issues with natural filament discoloring for long prints. not to mention those wavy lines of filament (although the bottom of the print did turn out fine despite those wavy lines of over heating). 

what's the solution? should i just turn my bed up to like 120c?  keep in mind i'm printing in an ""enclosure""  already. 

the only other idea would be to use abs juice. i have seen others post about this despite the issue with pei and acetone. but people have reported not having problems provided you apply it at room temp. i don't want to ruin the pei...  but then it's not really doing its job... thoughts?

zebra plate,"hello all,

 i've checked the manual, this forum, and youtube videos, and i'm having a hard time finding an image of the plate actually coming off. 

to clarify the question: can zebra plate or another flexible plate be used with no or minimal modification to the printer, yes or no?

thank you all!

~justine","the order is in for the taz 5, thanks again for the input.

in the makergear m2 world there seems to be a lot of success and momentum using a bead blasted 1/4"" mic6 plate (fine-grain, low distortion aluminum alloy available on mcmaster) as the bed surface, with hairspray. apparently folks are having great success with this surface for *all* materials, including the polycarbonate variants. one member of that forum in particular (jimc) has been bead blasting and cutting these plates for people, and i have one on order from him and will be excited to try it. 

the zebra is great, but as one gets increasingly used to reliable adhesion and print quality, the next biggest annoyance starts to seem unacceptable, which is surface flatness in the case of the zebra and which is supposedly great on the mic6 plate.

in any case, if the mic6 test on the makergear at home goes well, we'll be making one for the taz as well (to go over the pei, although a more extensive mod is on the table). being able to do large polycarbonate-ish prints reliably will reduce how highly subscribed we are to machine shops significantly so i have a lot of interest in this."
flexystruder too tight for filament,"i've been trying to use ninja flex on my flexystruder, but it just doesn't seems to fit, any 3mm filament won't fit into this extruder, this has been a problem since day one, when i installed the brand new flexydual, on my taz 5.

when i look into the extruder cavity, the dented cylinder it's blocking half of the way.





i disassembled the extruder to see if something was wrong.





i couldn't find any reason why the filament it's being blocked.





without the cylinder you can see through the cavity.

any insights of what may be happening?","make sure the ""dent"" section of the hobbed bolt lines up with the hole correctly. you may need to play with washer positions and thickness to get it right."
one week with a new taz 5,"okay so i got my new taz last week and have been playing quite a bit with it. now i have even more questions
1.     what is the z height supposed to be from the table? instructions call out a folded sheet of paper but the machinist in me just can't accept that as a valid form of measurement.....so do we say .007 .009 or .005 off the table? does this ever change with differing material or does it stay consistent?   
2.     just now while reading around a bit it says to flash the firmware, which i had thought i had done but maybe not? my e0 steps was set at 800 but the literature i got with the machine says it should have been 842 would this make a big difference?
3.     leveling the table,  i can get the table dead perfect in the four corners (using a .0001 dial indicator) plus or minus .0003 any way ( i am quite amazed at the repeatability of this little machine! now the bad thing the table rises .015 in the center of the table, i was accrediting this to a warped table but just thought that perhaps this is the dreaded x axis sag that i hear about. is this amount of sag/ warpage present me with a major hurdle? anyway to add some compensation someplace to compensate for this? or does .015 not make much difference? ( in my world .015 is kinda like kicking field goals lengthwise on a field)
4.     when i print any of the files supplied by lulzbot the prints come out pretty darned nice and i am quite impressed, when i print any other files it is pretty much hit or miss, could their codes be set with a profile with perfected profiles settings?
5.     when i look in cura under expert settings advanced tab i see initial layer thickness set at .425 highlighted in yellow this seems high to me (please keep in mind i know nothing, just call me 'sargent schultz' and the only reason it seems high is if i change it too .3 or less the yellow goes away and highlighting is never good..... they never highlighted a passing grade on my report cards in school....it would have saved them a lot of pens had they)
6.    when i download and the load profiles into cura do i need to do this each time or does cura keep track of them for me?   i would assume it keeps track for me

and lastly could you guys share your favorite settings for pla hips and abs bed temp and extruder temp i keep seem to be finding conflicting recommendations. i have been using 230 and 110 for both hips and abs so far, i have no pla as of yet but will be getting some in the mail on thursday i believe.

in advance thank you 
dave","1.  i think they recommend the folded paper just because its convenient.  being a machinist, i'm sure you've got some vernier calipers to measure the thickness of the folded paper...    last time i measured, it was something like .03mm.

2.  the factory should have applied the proper firmware for the machine equipped with the single extruder.  if you use an older toolhead with the ceramic budaschnozzle hotend, you'll need to flash an older firmware.  likewise if you switch to a dual extruder, the firmware will need to be flashed depending on the toolhead version...  you'll most likely get a v2.  to flash the firmware, use the lulzbot edition of cura.

3.  that's the sag from the weight of the toolhead on the factory rods.  hence all the mods to openbeam, 12mm rods or at least hardened rods...  your bed isn't warped. 

4.  the lulzbot edition of cura has good starting quickprint profiles.  just choose ""all"" to see the various profiles they've created for each type of filament.  i don't know the setting used at the factory to slice the sample gcode files on the sd.  to get the best prints out of cura choose the ""high detail"" radio button... in general a thinner layer height and slower print speed will yield the best results.

5. typically the nozzle diameter is the high limit for the layer height.  most folks use a .3, .2 or .1 layer heights... .4 is reasonable for the .5 nozzle.  smaller the nozzle diameter is better for delicate / intricate designs.  for practical parts around the farm a .5 nozzle is fine and will print faster... again if you're going to be printing lattices, and figurines get yourself a .35 nozzle.  

think of the hotend as a tube of toothpaste pointed down dragging across the sink/counter.  closerthe thinner the layer height, squeeze more you'll get a wider extrusion.

6.  cura will keep the last used settings.  so if you close the application and restart tomorrow with loading a different model, cura should have saved your previous settings.  

lulzbot has a chart with the recommended bed temps and treatments for each type of filament.  the extrusion temp will be based on the filament manufacturer... typically the range will be marked on the spool.  for esun abs, i like using 245c extrusion temp and 110c bed temp for the first few layers.  then drop the bed temp to 100c at 2-3mm, and vary the extrusion temp based on the print height between 241-243c.  that just works best for my print environment.  you'll have to determine your temps for the type / brand of filament and your print environment.

hope that helps!  have fun printing."
filament binding,is anybody having an issue with filament binding in the filament guide?  i've had this issues more than a few times.  any help or guidance would be great.  thank you in advance,"if you mean the long guide tube, it might be debris that's built up in that.

occasionally when changing filament i'll use the new filament to push a q-tip head through the guide tube ahead of the filament.  just the fiber tip and maybe 5mm or so of the body behind it.  the first time i thought to try that i was surprised at all of the black gunk that came out on the q-tip at the end."
taz 5 prints size larger than expected,"hello,

i have had my taz 5 for a few months now.  i have been recently having trouble with smaller more complex prints with pieces that snap together or are supposed to have a very tight tolerance.  one of the items i was wanting to make was this from thingiverse: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:586169 which is a combo lock box.  many many people have made this based on the ""makes"" section and i seem to be having trouble.  the parts on this and many other small tight tolerance pieces come out very poorly fitting and require very very extensive sanding to get it to fit.  the parts that i have made look to my eye as good quality without any obvious defects or poor printing characteristics.  

i have printed a calibration cube from thingiverse  (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:271736) that is supposed to be exactly 20mmx20mmx20mm and it is slightly off.  measuring from the bottom to the top or any of the sides is approximately 20.15 +/- .03.  the top appears to have a slightly proud lip around the edge that throws off measurements to something like 20.35 +/- .05.  

i have only printed in hatchbox pla (this was done with yellow) at 205/60 for my temps.  i should note i have made many large cosplay props and other items that just were flat glue together surfaces that came out great.

is there any kind of calibration i can do to try to get more precise dimensional accuracy out of my printer so that i can print these more complex fitting parts?  if any other information is needed please let me know. 

thanks,

i do not know how to adjust the steps on the three axis'.  is there a link to a guide somewhere for this process?  


not that i know of, but it is a simple formula:

expected size / measured size * current steps = new steps.

example for a 20 mm cube:

100 mm / 100.15 mm * 1600.0 = 1597.6
100 mm / 100.15 mm * 100.5 = 100.34

then you change them in the configuration-advanced settings(latest taz 5 version) menu for the taz(xsteps / mm, ysteps / mm and zsteps / mm.). for the mini you would have to execute the same function by querying the settings saved in the firmware, and then using the gcode commands as shown in the output of the gcode print settings query (m503) for their current values.

i would find and use the 100 mm calibration model somewhere on the site myself, and not the 20 mm calibration cube model. i think it would give better results. no i do not remember where i found the file.  "
taz5 unwanted retraction - confused?,"been having issues with prints sticking to the plate because when it starts, nothing is extruding. i've pretty much fixed it by increasing the amount of skirt that prints.

but when printing with a raft, a good portion of the raft doesnt print, because theres no primer skirt.

so, had an idea - my old makerbot would start from x/y 0/0 and draw a nice fat line on the plate to prime the print. using the start/end gcode tab in cura, i added a part that made a nice fat line from x0 y0 to x100 y0, then draw 2mm to x100 y2, then back again to x0 y2.

problem is, it went fine from x0 to x100, but as soon as it made the turn to go to x100 y2, it retracted, a lot. it never un-retracted. the extruder moved forward but nothing came out ujntil the last 15mm or so.

i then checked the code and retraction should not have been on there. i even did some googling, and used m209 to turn the auto/firmware retraction off. still did it.

x-axis stepper motor issue,"we have a fairly new taz 5 that has only been in use for about 12 days. it's been printing pretty nicely, and nearly constantly, up until now, then the stepper motor for the x-axis went wonky during the middle of a print. i didn't see what happened right when this stopped working, as i have student employees who run the place on the weekends, but this is what i found this morning:



when testing the axis motion, the head would only move back and forth about a centimeter or so. when i disabled the steppers to move the head manually, it does not freely move, and moves jerkily. i did take a bit of video with my phone:

https://youtu.be/4y0dwauraqi

does anyone have any suggestions for resolving this issue quickly? does this look like it is this a belt issue or a more serious problem with the motor? i don't have a lot of experience with this type of printer since we've only had it for a few weeks (we have a uprint we've been using for 6 years, and that usually only had extrusion issues rather than motion issues). i'd like to make sure i've tried everything i can before calling support.

thanks,

taz hexagon 40mm fan mount,"i have seen the problems people have with heat creep since the taz printer started using the hex hotend. it's caused by that tiny fan not being able to keep it properly cooled for long prints.

so i decided i would tackle the issue by making my own mount. now, i have a taz 4 with the hexagon hotend upgrade and that is what i designed this for. i am not 100% sure it will fit on the taz 5 but i think it will.

this did take 8 hours of design and around 5 prints to get it right. i don't have my fan yet (should be here tomorrow) but i am fairly confident this will work properly.

i wanted to stick with the 5v fan since the wiring is already there. i also wanted to find the best fan i could get that would not be noisy and would last a long time. i did a lot of searching and decided there was one great choice, a noctua nf-a4x10 5v fan, this brand came highly recommended by some high end computer builders, they called it ugly since it's brown and off white but that is the signature of noctura and they are not from china but austria i got my for $14.89 off amazon.

the fan shroud fits around the cooling fins by friction but also has a single bolt mount using the existing hotend bolt.

please let me know if this works on the taz 5 or taz mini is you decide to use it.

remember this is a work in progress, this might end up being the final design but i won't know until i have fully tested it.

","been quite a few years since taking fluid dynamics... but the duct should gradually compress the air.  the short duct is like putting a fan in front of a brick wall. i'm guessing the center of the box fan may not be generating a lot of air flow since that's the axis or solid hub.

with that said, the 40x40 fan should increase airflow over the oem blower. give your current design a shot...

if interested in making the duct and fan more efficient, consider the following:
- move the exhaust behind the heatsink so airflow wraps around the fins. 
- make the duct lower to capture the lowest part of the heatsink and possibly part of the heat break (transition zone).
- make the exhaust wider than the fins to decrease backflow... or vent the duct with additional slits.

personally, i think the design flaw is the oem blower sits too high.  the airflow should probably start lower than the heatsink and encompass the heat break.  the heat may be creeping too far up the heat break, causing the filament to swell (as it starts to liquify) and ultimately jam.  keeping the filament solid and a consistent 3mm all the way to the heater block should reduce the jamming with pla.

anyway... hope it works!

ps - for more information about what's happening in the hotend, the prometheus hotend campaign lists this description:
""friction occurs most prominently in the “transition-zone” of the hot end where the plastic is changing from solid, to rubbery, to liquid. the plastic remains solid in the ""cold-zone"" until it is heated above its glass transition temperature (tg) in the ""transition-zone"" at which point it is ""rubbery"" until it is heated above its melting temperature (tm) and turns to liquid in the ""melt-zone"". in its “rubbery” state at temperatures between tg and tm, the plastic turns soft and expands to form a plug in the “transition-zone”. this plug of soft rubbery plastic is the most significant source of friction in the hot end and is the leading cause of hot end jams."""

squaretrade warranty on used taz,i'm considering picking up a second taz 5 that is one month old in a nearby area for $1500 via ebay.  ebay offers an extended warranty  (2years) through squaretrade for $350.  i was wondering if anyone has every used those warranties as i can't image they would know how to fix a printer.,you can replace the most expensive part on the printer three times for the price of the warranty. no way in the world i would go for that. 
leveling issues,"after a frustrating time trying to get the taz 5 properly level, i measured the distance between the x-axis rod and the top of the frame and it turns out that theres about a 3mm difference between the left and right side – the right side of the rod beeing about 3mm higher than the left side.

the difference is more than i’m able to adjust for with the screws, and to get it as good as possible i have to turn the z-axis screw all the way in.

does anyone have any suggestion about how to remedy this?","i had a similar problem. so this is what i did:



1. i took the little ruler that comes with the taz and made a little jig that slips over it with tension and allows me to set a ""stop"" point.
2. move your z-axis to to the home position and disengage your motors.
3. place the end of the ruler on top of the metal plate (i prefer using the left side), and move the stop you put on the ruler until it touches the x-axis lower rod. this is your reference height
4. next, move your ruler to the right side and repeat the measurement. rotate the coupler where the z-axis motor connects to the threaded shaft by hand until the rod hits the stop on your ruler.

now your x-axis is level with the metal plate (and presumably, with the whole rig)

now, i would suggest you screw your bed screws all the way down. don't get aggressive, just get them all to a baseline. now, unscrew each one the same number of rotations until you have half the screw raised. no it's not scientific, but will get you really close to level.

now reset your stop point screw by following the directions. you should find that once you get the gross height worked out with the stop screw ans piece of paper, the bed leveling screws will only need minor tweeks to get consistnat height around your bed.

good luck."
dual extruder pva supports/automatic?,"i have been investigating the dual extruder, thinking it would be a great addition for printing the supports in pva.  so, is there a setting or something to tell cura to automatically print the supports using the 2nd extruder?  in other words, is there a simple way to say ""print this object, but print all the supports using head #2""?

or how do people do this sort of thing.

wierd extruder motor issue that just started,"i just ran into an extruder issue i have never seen before, and it has me pretty well baffled. i'm hopeing that someone has seen this before and knows what it might be. 

i'm printing a pretty standard part, when i notice that every 6th or 7th line of extrusion isn't coming out. i figure it's a loose gear or a missing tooth or something. so i do some troubleshooting and determine that the motor is turning fine for a few seconds, then it seems to loose all of its horsepower. it's still trying to turn, i hear motor noise, it just doesn't have enough juice. the gear, gear mesh, small setscrew, etc. are all fine. i can see the shaft, and the flat part isn't rotating at all. the shaft itself doesn't appear to be broken. 

so i try a different motor, one that i know to be working. same thing. 

the fan on the controller box is working normally, and nothing major has changed in the last couple of weeks. i'm thinking it's either a short in the wire harness, a fuse partially melted, or a rambo board issue.

none of the other axis motors are showing any signs of issues. i have more motors i can try on the extruder, but i'm pretty sure at least one of the two i already tried is functional. nothing changed on firmware or controll software, and if i extrude direct from the lcd controller without being plugged into the computer it seems to do the same thing. 

any ideas? has anyone seen this before? i'mhopeing it's a fuse issue or a wire harness or something else i haven't thought of, because i really don't want to buy another rambo board. 

thanks in advance!
tim","only thing still the same is the driver chip. different cable, and stepper motor with the same symptoms. m.t.b.f. bit you in the pocketbook.

grinding through pla at a crazy rate,"hey
i was printing with hips and recently switched to pla. the first few prints went fine but recently i've been having lots of problems with the filament grinding. i lose about 3 in every 4 prints due to it. each time i clean the notched rod in the extruder to ensure all the grooves are clear and adjust the set screws to anywhere from the recommended 8mm gap to tighter, but most times i end up grinding a notch in the filament and losing the print.

i've been able to extrude by hand after it failed so it's not a clog, i've even tried the ""heat to 250, cool to 90, quickly pull out"" to clear the nozzle of anything inside. 

i've tried temperatures ranging from 190 to 210 with no luck. i usually get the first layer or 20 down, but not much past it. the filament is 3mm ic3d pla, tried white, black and natural, all grind around the same rate.

slicing using stock cura settings for standard speed pla.","pla conducts heat a lot better than other materials, so what happens is that heat travels up the filament and causes it to swell right above the brass bushing in the extruder mounting plate.  when this happens, the filament gets hung up and the drive bolt digs into the filament.  at this point you are done, until you manually clear it.

if you look at the physical configuration of the heat sink as it relates to the extruder tube, you will see that it is doing next to nothing to actually cool the filament.  the contact area between the heat sink and the metal filament tube is tiny, apparently by design.  i'm not sure why it was designed like this, i have asked lulzbot tech support on a couple different occasions to explain their design philosophy, but so far they have not given me any explanation.  perhaps i am misunderstanding the purpose of the heatsink altogether.

the bottom line of all of this is that more airflow on the heat sink will do very little to prevent heat creep.  i put a second fan on it and it did not solve the problem, and in fact made no appreciable improvement.  i also added slotted washers with heatsink compound in an effort to increase the surface area, and it did not help.  i did these two things before i looked at the drawings for the heat sink and the filament tube and saw the very minimal contact area.  after i saw this, the fact that they didn't work made perfect sense.

pla is a very desirable material for a number of reasons, particulalry low warpage and the ability to use pva support.  it is only for these reasons that i have invested a ton of time trying to make it work.  i still have a couple things to try before i give up.  if i have a breakthrough i will certainly post about it on this forum."

thoughts?","kcchen_00 wrote:so... the dual extruder v2 came in the mail today.  it's a monster... its looks to be well built upon first inspection.  for the most part it looks like it well do well for dual color printing of the same filament.  because of the fan duct system, it may not do well in mixed filament prints which require different fan cooling characteristics.

here's a picture of the bottom of the extruder:
lb dual extruder v2.jpg

there are two fans which can be independently controlled.  the issue is the fan ducts.  each duct cools both hotends.  ideally each fan would independently cool the left and right side of each hotend.

so if printing different filament types in each extruder, the options are to block one of the duct port so that only one hotend is cooled by the associated fan or to redesign the ducts so they wrap around the hotend... which would make changing the nozzle more difficult.

i have mixed emotions about this.  i have the utmost respect for lulzbot and the engineers.  while this seems like a minor over-sight... it doesn't demonstrate the expertise i'd expect.  i hope the folks at lulzbot re-visit the duct design for the dual extruder v2.

i got mine too. the other part i don't like about the ducts is they are printed. these are the metal hex extruders and can be run at 300 c. so those ducts are not going to survive. they need to be made out of something else.

also minor quibble my mount came with a crack where one of the heat inserts was installed and the insert was sticking half way out (the screw pulled it out and there was a gap). looks like they didn't get it hot enough and jammed it in delaminating the print. no big deal i can reprint the mount, but that shouldn't happen to a $500 assembly. where was quality control? it was very obvious. i noticed it within 5 seconds of taking it out of the box."

dual extruder flexy upgrade.,"please delete if already posted.
i've been scouring the forums looking for anyone who's tried printing ninjaflex with the dual extruder v2, or someone who has modded theirs to extrude ninjaflex on one side. i just bought the taz 5, and was unable to purchase the flexydualie as they were discontinued (v2 update coming). in the meanwhile i'm sitting here drooling over people who can make incredible things with their flexy dual extruders. has anyone made it work with a dual extruder v2 mod? 

thanks!","mecizeldec wrote:thanks for the response!
that's what i did. i ordered the dual v2 for now, and plan to print what i need for the flexstruder. i just didn't know if they were compatible like that. is there a recommended filament for this?


they should be compatible... the previous flexistruder shared a common x-carriage mount as the single extruder.  to be sure, i'd pre-assemble through the stls in something like sketchup.

that is to say, if mostly what i want to do is mix two non-flexy filaments, shouldn't i get the dual print head and not the flexy-dually?  it's all very confusing, could someone clear this up please?  


if you want to dual extrude non-flexible filaments, then get the normal dual extruder.  if you want the optioni to extrude softer filaments, then the flexydually is what you'd want.  

the extruder for flexible filaments can be used to extrude non-flexible filaments, this will cause the ptfe tube to wear faster and require replacement sooner.  the ptfe tube serves as a guide for the filament, and replaces the idler (on the normal extruder, akin to the lever arm with bearing of the pb direct drive extruder) to apply pressure to the hobbed bolt to advance the filament."

how long does pei sheet usually last?,"just wondering how long the pei sheet typically lasts for most folks? i've had my taz 5 for maybe 5 or 6 weeks, maybe around 120-150 hours of printing, and i'm starting to notice it coming up and bubbling in a few places... also accepting tips on how to fix this without buying a new sheet every couple months?

thanks!","i've been using a zebra on my mini for a few weeks. it takes a little getting used to, but works quite well. as it's not glued down, it's not as level as pei is. that's not a big deal for most people, but for some uses it could be a problem. i've printed over the whole thing now, and i don't have problems once i dialed in the z-offset. the auto-leveling on the mini complicates it a bit, but you won't have that issue on a taz. 

i've printed hips, abs, and petg on it. everything sticks well, once i got the offset and temperatures dialed in right. it releases easier than pei, and so far i haven't had to remove it and flex it to get parts removed. if you get one, start with lower bed temps than you are used to. apparently, too high can cause parts to become stuck far too well. i have found setting the software to about 60c works well. for the same reason, start a little further away than you would with pei. it doesn't seem to need the first layer quite as smashed down as pei does.

1013 wrote:i have noticed some hysteresis in the z-axis
is there a link somewhere that explains what hysteresis is, in layman terms? i have no machine design background, and the wikipedia page about it may as well be written in mandarin. 

hysteresis is the type of motion you get when you have backlash and friction.....basically, hysteresis is caused by a combination of backlash and other things, though backlash is usually the main cause.

lets say you command the x axis to move from 10mm to 100mm and you put an indicator on it and zero it out. now you command the x axis to move to 190mm. and then you command it back to 100mm. the indicator will no longer be at exactly zero, and the number you get (lets say you get 1mm) is the actual hysteresis. backlash is one of the main causes of hysteresis, but it is not the only one. loose bearings, and high friction in the linear guides can also contribute to it.

another way to visualize hysterysis is to go out to your car, near the front wheel and push down on it to cmpress the spring and then slowly let it come back up. measure the distance from the bottom of the car to the ground. now pull up on the car and then slowly let it settle back down and re-measure. the difference in the measurement is the hysteresis.

hysteresis is a general term that can apply to many things, not just mechanical systems. there is magnetic hysteresis, and electrical, as well as others i am sure."
case fan upgrade [tutorial],"i recently upgraded my power supply fan to a super awesome quiet noctua fan. i just upgraded the case as well and here's how i did it (special thanks for javier and victor):

**not responsible if you screw up, ground yourself and don't be stupid. this tutorial will avoid soldering and modding your rambo!

tools: fan, buck converter, wires, wire stripper, flat head, optional stand offs to mount on the case

fan link: http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/b00n ... ge_o02_s00

buck converter: http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/b00q ... ge_o01_s00
*a little overkill but the display will allow people without a multimeter to dial in the voltage. this also will allow us to avoid soldering headers onto the rambo

link to photos in case they don't show up below: http://imgur.com/a/q75tr

1. **disconnect from power and remove the case from the frame. remove the case cover and fan. strip about an inch off the ends of two 8-10"" wires.


2. insert the two wires into the terminal blocks labeled ""in + and in -"". remove the connector off the end of the noctua fan. either cut or fold away the green and blue wires. 
jst connector tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krvdgix4sk4


3. remove the power header from the rambo board. unscrew 2 terminal blocks to pull out a red and yellow wire


4. wrap the two wires you prepared earlier around the respective wire (red going into the in+ and yellow going into in-). insert back into the terminal block and tighten! then plug the header back into the board.


5. **do not plug the fan in yet! please plug in power and turn on the power supply. you want to press the button on the buck converter that says ""o"" for ""output"", then adjust the voltage with the ""+"" and ""-"" buttons until you hit ""12"" for 12 volts. if you got the buck converter with the potentiometer, use a flat head an tune it until you get 12 volts.


6. insert the ""yellow"" (+) and ""black"" (-) wires from the fan into the buck converter. you will have to unfold and clip off most of the ends for them to fit in the terminal. **do not leave any conductive (silver) parts exposed outside the terminal block, keep clipping until they're really in there like the photo below.


7. good to go! just do some nice cable management. you may have to push down on some existing wires to make the fan fit. also install the rubber pins that come with the fan. i wouldn't use screws to mount.


8: optional: it would be wise to mount this so you don't short anything out. i used motherboard stand offs. drilled 2 holes into the case and used 2 bolts to secure the stand offs. then mounted the buck converter with two screws. 





**the only downside is that the fan is always running. but at least it's much much quieter. i was not able to find a dependable 12v power rail on the rambo and wanted to avoid soldering headers. also powering the fan from the source will ensure that we don't cause issues somewhere else.

"modified taz5 for 1.7mm filament, have 'bulging' corners","got a taz5 a few months back, and having a huge number of spools of 1.7mm filament left from my makerbot nightmare, i wanted to modify my taz5 to run the 1.7mm. purchased and swapped out a .4mm nozzle/1.75mm filament hexagon hot end. tweaked some settings and found that setting cura to 92% flow rate, .4mm nozzle and 1.75mm filament gave me the best prints.

but even after optimizing that, i still get corners that are bumped out, as well as some parts printing 'fatter' than they should be - as in i'll print an item with a hole, and a peg that should fit that hole, and after printing the hole diameter is too small and the peg diameter is too wide, and it does not fit.

thinking that i'm still pushing out too much filament i lowered the flow rate some more - but then i had layer adhesion issues. i don't think the flow rate can safely go any lower.

what else could be causing this? some images below to show what corners look like. these were printed with pla (i hate abs, no matter what i do large prints curl off the print bed, not worth the tinker time. pla just works for me). all corners shown in these pics should be hard 90 degree corners.



part of the bad adhesion shown in this pic is due to a try at less than 92% flow rate. the more important part is seen from the side, as opposed to above, how far out the corners are bulging.



","lasersharkdesign wrote:lots of terms in there i've heard but am not 100% sure of (esteps, for one). is there a good central place that defines all these terms? of course i'll be googling them once i get some free time to read up, but if there is a place here, or a central wiki somewhere that is a solid source of good info, i'd rather start somewhere that someone can recommend, rather than doing the google-and-hope method.

good call with the printing something to fit over a known object. i'll give that a shot tomorrow. i've a bunch of m5 stuff laying about from a build i did a few years ago that i never got around to finishing.

how is it that printing too fast would cause a corner bulge? because of the deceleration and acceleration coming into and going out of the corner and that not being matched with a change in the flow rate? i can see how a slower overall speed would result in a smoother decel and accel, thus leading to a better corner. am i understanding that correctly?

how would i adjust acceleration to attempt to fix that?

googling the terms or searching this forum will yield good information.  e-steps relates to the stepper motors accuracy to feed the requested amount of filament... so if you request to extrude 100mm of filament, the motor should accurately perform.  the calibration steps can be found here.

yep, you're on the right track why slowing things down will produce more accurate prints.  the stepper motor is a lot of mass to move around and creates a lot of momentum.  so slowing things down will allow the toolhead to keep up with the requested movements.

with that said, i guess i'm a bit impatient.   i regularly print at 90mm/s.  the real key is to ensure the printhead slows down where it counts the most, the exterior finish.  so print the infill fast, but slow it down to 50-40mm/s for the exterior layer.  the speed settings can be found on the ""advanced"" tab."
filament support for dual extruders,"don't know if anyone else has this problem with their dual extruder but when one of my head's filament is idle for a long time the point where the filament enters the extruder becomes weak from bending back and forth when the x axis moves and it eventfully breaks. maybe the issue is because of where my spools are on top of the enclosure my taz5 is in. in any case i fixed the problem by adding a simple support bracket to my dual head. i no longer have broken idle filament.

before the bracket


with the 3d printed bracket installed (yes it clears the top of the taz frame). the oem screw was replaced with a m3x30 screw and the bracket is held on with a wing nut. the bracket does not have to be removed to change filament. the holes in the bracket have to be large enough so the guide tube can move freely at all z axis heights and x axis positions.
","very nice!  i had the same problem, and did something similar:

viewtopic.php?f=36&t=3319

one thing i like better about yours is that you left more clearance so that you don't have to remove the bracket to change the filaments.  that's especially important because more pressure and flexing of the head during filament changes means an increased likelihood of having to re-level everything.

my design actually holds the ends of the filament guide tubes; they are an interference fit.

i also can't tell from the pictures if there is a radius on the inside corner of the bracket.  it kinda looks like there isn't.  having a radius there will greatly increase the strength of that corner."
so what do you think went wrong with my taz print?,"printing with hips at recommended temperatures and ugh....it was tearing away. i am guessing during the night when the heat went lower the room got colder and might have attributed to this. 

is this normal for trying to print large without an enclosure?

thanks.","i've never printed with hips.  but if that were abs, i'd recommend:
- slightly higher extrusion temp... maybe 2-3c higher.  this should keep the filament in a liquefied state longer to promote adhesion to the previous layer.
- turn off cooling from the fan... again, this is advice with abs in mind... not sure for hips.  cooling too fast causes materials to contract.  on top of poor layer adhesion, parts will split / delaminate.
- try a more forgiving material like pla or petg
- work on enclosing the printer or at the very least move the printer away from the window and a/c vents.  there could be a change in temperature varying the ambient temps.

hope that helps!"
bubbling on top surface of print and corner lifting,"hello,
we have been having an issue where sometimes the top surface of a flat print will bubble over the honeycomb pattern.  also having some issues with corner adhesion. i've looked up the various methods of solving the adhesion issues,  but have not seem anything on the forums about the bubbling. will try cleaning and sanding the bed,  lowering the x stop,  adding a brim, and releveling the bed.  any ideas about the bubbling? printing with pla with the default cura settings.","looks like the top layer is too thin.  this could be a combination of the layer height and number of top / bottom layers.  cura looks to calculate this for you when specifying a shell thickness.  typically a 1.5mm shell is a good standard for the shell / skin of the print.  this should provide for a fairly strong part.    

as for the corner lifting, strange that its happening with pla.  can you post a picture of the project bottom?  warping could indicate a un-level bed... one corner could be dipping.  the best way i've found to level the bed is through the use of dial gauges to allow for a more quantitative calibration.  my preference is to use two gauges on either side of the toolhead using these brackets.  here's a pic:



taz5 - dual dial gauges.jpg (33.33 kib) viewed 653 times



if you're pretty certain your bed is level, try anchors in addition to brim.  some folks call them ""mouse ears""...  in any case, its basically adding thin discs to problem areas (typically corners) for better adhesion to the bed.  there are a few on thingiverse, but they go by different names.... i've attached a version.  scale the disc in the xy, try to keep z constant... its .5mm thick which is still pretty easy to remove.

the other thing you could try is to add negative z-offset (found in the machine settings). which will move the nozzle closer to the bed.  this should improve adhesion.  don't use too much, try increments of -.1mm.  might need a good part removal tool also.


hope some of those tips help!"
"z zero micrometer mount, pictures, files","hi all,

  i would like to share an upgrade i made for my taz 5, which is a micrometer mount to adjust the z homing height with precision.  i have used a micrometer head graduated in thousandths of inch, but there is the same model that comes in mm for those who prefer that measurement format.
  the reason:  i recently had a pei bed surface come unglued from the glass bed due to a large footprint abs part cooling past 50deg. c.  i thought if i could adjust the z homing height for large- footprint parts to be a little farther away from the bed, then the removal force could be less forceful, and conversely if i were then printing small footprint parts that have a large z height, i could then adjust the z homing height to make the initial layer to be a little closer to the bed and have a little better adhesion.  the repeat ability inherent in the z homing height screw that comes on the taz was insufficient for making those slight adjustments with confidence, in my opinion.
  the support personnel at lulzbot were awesome regarding the remedy for the pei bed problem, so when i was back up and running, i made this micrometer mount, which hopefully would allow me to steer clear of that problem again in the future, and i would like to share this with the rest of the lulzbot community, if anyone is interested.
  the z limit switch gets turned around and attached to the same holes but just facing in the other direction.

if you have some advises, i'm ready to read them !

thank you ","i did some tests and also prints at various fine layer heights (meaning 0.025 to 0.1mm). some of my results:
.) printing slow is much more important for a ""clean"" look than to print at low layer heigts.
.) if you look very closely, you will always see the layer steps, at last if your model contains areas of flat angles.
.) you need 0.05mm or lower to make your layers hard to see on flat angles (~30°)
.) if you go lower than 0.1mm, artefacts due to vibration in the drive system are clearly visible and make your print look ""bumpy"".

that said, you need a well calibrated printer to go <=0.1mm layer height, and for larger prints even than you need to print the first layer thicker, say 0.2mm for example to compensate sag of the x axis. you will have new problems like curling up edges, and your print times can be measured in days if your objects are not very small.

given all that facts, i respect 0.075-0.1mm as the lowest possible layer height for not-test-only prints.  "

to adjust the z binding on the taz, you must first locate the 4 allen head screws that attach the x carriage assembly to the z nut mounts. once you have located them, then you will loosen all 8 allen head screws, 4 on each side. after this you will need to auto home the printer. then move the z axis to close to the top of the printer using cura (245mm from home). then re-home the printer again. please do this 2 times bottom to top and back. then please move the z axis to the middle of the printer. once you have the x carriage in the middle of the printer, re-tighten the 4 allen head screws connected to the z nut mounts on each side.

on my other printer (older model printrbot simple) there was a pot on the electronics you could adjust for each stepper when this started to happen. is there something similar on the taz? 

i have some 40mm heatsinks which might help, but i'd really like to fix the problem so the motor doesn't burn out in a year if possible. 

thanks!","hi,

did changing the stepper resolve your issue?

we're having a very similar issue with our 11 months new taz4 now.

the extruder/feed stepper overheats (reaches 91°c) after 10 to 15 minutes of printing time.
then the filament-feed stops moving or only moves very sporadically. everything else continues on as if nothing had happened,
but no more filament get's extruded. obviously prints are getting ruined.

i cleaned and tested the big cogwheel for resistance, but did not encounter any.
i ran a print with the filament removed, the filament tension mount relaxed in order to reduce any resistance the stepper might encounter. still overheated.
then i tried attaching a big passive heatsink. that bought as an extra minute but did not really solve the problem.

thus my original question: did exchanging the stepper solve your issue? or was it something else?

my first impulse would have been to reduce the amperage feeding the extruder, but the taz4 electronics don't seem to allow any adjustments, so i left them alone.

any suggestions for what we could try to fix / further debug the problem?"
taz5 dual v2 issue - could it be firmware ?,"hi, 

got my taz5 dual v2 in about 3 weeks ago (dynamism uk) and after installing i noticed some issues.
it hangs forward very much. i had to put extra washers in the front head for it to be on the same z level as the back.
i must have needed a full 3 mm. that was to be overcome.
it was printing fine, only did some small stuff.

but now, i cannot print anything anymore without it going wrong.
symptoms:
- the display on the printer itself is not displaying correctly. like its got the wrong resolution settings. 
if i go into the menu and change temp on the front ext (for example) i see the word temp on the left bottom corner but the value half on the right top corner.
- extruder temp on the back extruder cannot reach higher then 212 degrees, even though in menu i select 230

doing a single filament print 
- front extruder : after about a layer or 3 (1.5 hours) , the front extruder wheel stops turning. the program continues but no filament is coming out (3 reprints same issue)
- back extruder: after 4 layers (further then the front extruder at least) , it goes bananas , starts full travel speed x axis, slams through home and starts grinding like nuts

never had a single issue when running the single head for over 500+ hours in the last months

got a major deadline coming up so need any advise here!

did the command as was suggested. that worked. havent seen the display issue yet but maybe thats because i havent leveled my bed yet and printed something."
taz 5 freezes,"hello guys (and gals). i just bought a taz 5 a few weeks back and i'm having a little bit of an issue with the prints. i would say about 50% of the time the print fails. the screen stays on, bed and nozzle heated, but no movement from any stepper. lcd readout says printing still. 

i'm printing from an sd card (the one that came with the unit) and have the taz connected to a voltage stabilized ups. i've used both slic3r and cura to generate the gcodes. usually it is longer prints that fail, but i have had it fail on the second layer of a small print. usually i reslice the model and it runs successfully, however on the small print i reran the same gcode and it failed in the exact same location. this leads me to believe that the gcode was bad. resliced it after that and it completed. i have also had models fail 5 times in a row at different points each time (each time i resliced it and generated new gcode). 

the models are all made in freecad and none of them showed any manifold errors. it appears to be an issue with the gcode being generated, but it is intermittent and happens with two different slicers. i never know if the code is good or bad until hours into a very long print, sometimes 90% through. this makes it incredibly frustrating and difficult to diagnose. we use this machine to print plugs for frp molds, so when a 40 hour print fails at hour 32, it sets us back an entire day or more on each project.

usb cable is unplugged from the computer before i print from the sd. i don't recall if the issue ever happened while bringing from the usb cable, so i am running a 36 hour print from my mac now (same print that has failed twice now). if that works, i picked up a new sd card today to try next. maybe the sd has bad sectors or reads errors? 

i find it hard to believe that two different slicers are generating bad gcode. i'm thinking there is some sort of issue with either the sd card or the taz itself."
"ringing strong in x, low in y direction","hello together, i finaly got all my bearings changed to rjum-01-10 - after 3 month order time   
now i printed two 40x40 test cubes without infill, changing jerk every 5mm on the first and acceleration every 5mm on the other one to see whats possible.
in both tests there is a hughe difference on the corners (ringing) comparing x and y direction: along the y side of the cube, there is nearly no ringing even at 3000mm/s². on the x side, i get very strong ringing at this values.

first, is my assumption correct: the ringing on the x side should be an effect of swinging y axis (print bed) to the front and back, y ringing then vice versa from the x axis?
second: if this is true, what would the gurus out here recommend to try next? more or less belt tension?","i reorientated the pictures above for clarification. here is another one how it was printed on the bed:






the new bearings have absolutely no play, rods are not changed. this one are bearings with some kind of teflon, no ball bearings so hardened rods shouldn't be necessary i think.
i found something with google i will try in the next hours: i will print the square again at 3000mm/s², this time applying a little bit of force to the extruder in x and/or y direction while printing the upper half, lower half is then for comparison. if it comes from the extruder, my finger should dampen the vibration..

edit: no real difference with the finger test."
fixed my wobbletaz5,"wanting to print faster but having the shakes and resulting horrible print quality finally got me motivated to fix my ""wobbletaz5"". any attempt to print faster than 60mm/s with acceleration higher than around 500 was roflyao comical (well... except for the part where my print that should only take 2.5 hours needed 6 hours to complete at a decent quality level).

added more diagonal bracing to the front, back, and top as shown here and here

the right side z-axis guide rod was very loose in the hole, so i added the 2 zip ties to keep it still and also removed both top bearings from the screws as shown here (eliminated 95% of the z-axis banding problem i had) as shown here: here

probably the biggest problem of all was the massive amount of slop in the igus bearings on the 10mm shafts on both the x and y axis. z is also sloppy but because of the way it is loaded it isn't causing enough of a problem for me to worry about it. i replaced the x and y linear guide setup with hardened 10mm rods and linear bearings - completely eliminating the jumping around (literally) i was seeing with the print head at 1000+ acceleration. x-axis shown here

i am now printing at 120 to 150mm/s with acceleration set at 2400 with acceptable results. knock on wood - not missing steps and extruder heat is keeping up with filament flow.

manual z-axis control,"i'm trying to figure out how to manually move my z-axis from the machine without a tethered computer.  many of my jobs finish with the hot end pressing down onto the print and i'd like to both figure out how to make the hot end rise up from the job upon completion and to manually move it when necessary.  can you help?

making manual movements with the graphic lcd
as noted previously (page 126), making numerous manual movements is easier done using the printrun host software. however, you can make manual movements with the glcd. navigate to prepare -> move axis. you will select the length of the movement and then which axis to move. note; that only 1-mm and 0.1-mm movements are allowed for the z axis and extruder.
when at the move screen; turn the selection knob clockwise to move the axis in millimeters in the positive direction and counter-clockwise for the negative direction. push the selection knob to complete the manual move.

flexistruder... advise please,"can someone that has this add on give me an idea of how well it works, did you wish you just went with duel extruded instead? i want to play with rubber plastic composite flexi joints for some ideas i want to test out but i'm trying to find out what anyone's impression was of this device... worth it or not. so far i have loved my talbot 5 (completely stock) but i'm a mech e and i can't help myself when it comes to new add ons and tweaks.","the flexistruder and dual extruder are different beasts...  if you just want to use different materials, then the flexistruder is the ticket.  if you have a taz 5, just print the flexistruder (i'd also opt to use the hexagon, there's a shim to mod the existing extruder) and source the hobbed bolt and other hardware.

the dual extruder allows for dual extrusion of similar filaments (i think it will do pva as a second material for supports)... without modification it most likely won't print flexible filaments.  you could print one/two flexistruders and add to the dual extruder... then you'd have the flexidually.  but i'd start with the new dual extruder v2 for the aluminum frame which reduces the flex that plagued the original dual extruder designs (i've read of people with better success printing the lower frame in polycarbonate or nylon).

loose hotend,"so i recently went through my first major print failure, resulting in a nice blob of abs being built up and covering my nozzle and heater block in abs.  seeing as how this needed some major cleaning i figured it would be a good time to pull it all apart and take a look at all the pieces, just to have a more intimate knowledge of how the whole thing fit together/worked.  i got it all apart and it was a good thing i did this as i found that the idler plate for the hobbed bolt on the extruder cracked.  ironically, the print that failed was printing a whole new set of extruder and hotend pieces to have as backups.  i epoxied the cracked idler plate back together, so i can go print a replacement part.  now, i am noticing that the hotend can swivel in the aluminum bracket even when tightened down.  it also has some side to side rock and a lot of front to back rock/play.  is this normal?  i can't imagine that this is how the stock hotend is supposed to fit into this assembly as it would lead to dramatic inconsistencies in print quality.
i searched the forum for a loose hotend but got no hits, sorry if this is a repost or some common problem that has been discussed to death.","the hotend barrel should be locked in place by pressure from the extruder body itself pushing the top of the hotend down against the metal plate. it should be possible to rotate it within that location with a great deal of effort, but it shouldn't be moving freely. it's possible you have the plate itself upside down and backwards when you reinstalled it, which would make the channel the hotend rides in lower than it should be. if it is installed incorrectly, you would see a gap in the metal plate  when looking at the toolhead from the side that the hobbed bolt nut attaches to (opposite the side the gear is on). if you don't see that gap, it's probably installed correctly and something else odd is going on. can you post a picture? 

also, plastruct plastic weld will glue abs parts back together well if you have something split that needs to be repaired long enough to print a replacement."
cheap enclosure investigation!,"what do you think...could we make any of these work?

http://www.flowerhouses.com/backyard-home-greenhouses/","could work... anything that traps temps will work.  the thin nylon may dissipate heat too quickly, but the sides and top could be spam with insulation.  it would be better than no enclosure at all.

q about taz5 dual extruder v2 levelling screw,"i recently installed my dual extruder v2, and i'm dialing it in and getting it to work well.  i've used cura some, and simplify3d.

i have a question about the levelling screw, which is pictured well in the ohai assembly instructions, step 21.  i've added this picture here, plus some markings pointing to where i'm asking about.

i want to add a knurled knob to the cap of the levelling screw, because it's very inconvenient to use a hex wrench, and i'm pretty sure i can get enough force with a knob.  (when i'm only using 1 extruder, the rear, i like to adjust the front extruder high out of the way.)

there's a nut on the end of the levelling screw which i first thought was a lock nut that one would tighten after adjusting the levelling screw.  but on my system, this nut is 'fused' or 'stuck' onto the threads.  tight enough that a tug on a small wrench wouldn't loosen.  if it's supposed to be 'stuck' on the threads, i don't want to break it.

so is this just really a lock nut, or somehow stuck on to keep the screw captive?

thanks.","adding a knurled knob would be nice for finger adjustments... i've been looking for one on thingiverse that would just friction fit onto the m4 socket head.  i haven't come across anything that i like, so it'll probably need to be designed... a dual extrusion print with contrasting ""dial"" markers might be nice.

that nut is locked in place to allow the m4 screw to rotate freely in the aluminum plate. if it wasn't there i suspect the top plate with the insert would just ""push"" the screw out of the aluminum plate.  geburges described the functionality pretty well, and i suspect he's right about the loctite... or the screw could be tightened against the shoulder of the screw.

looking at the design, they should have screwed the m4 screw in from the top.  leave the aluminum plate solid.  which would allow the screw to ""press"" into the plate while using the threaded inserts for adjusting the deflection."
nozzle can't hoild temps above 240..is it me?,"i have the .5 nozzle, am printing at a .5 width and .25 layer height. currently i am printing at about 85mm/s with pla, and the fan on 100%.

i find that this pla (filkemp blend) prints nicely at higher temperatures, especially when printing fast(er) like this. but, it, like all pla really holds heat, so i run the fan on 100% at all times to prevent distortion.

the max temperature i can hold at the nozzle is 240-245. if i set it on 250, it just can't reach it.  should the printer be able to hold a temp above 240-245 in these circumstances? 

thank you!","it is a stock fan on the taz 5. i could remove the shroud, but there is no facility for aiming the fan. i've established that it can hit higher temperatures with the fan on a lower setting, so it stands to reason that it is the air hitting the end of the nozzle causing the fall in temps. that being said, as this is stock, shouldn't the nozzle be able to hold any temp?"

troublesome print - print size limitations,"]i'm beginning to feel that just because the build area is large on the taz 5, you can't actually print the full range of the build area.  i know, i know.. i was being very naïve..  i have a print job going now that is the largest print i've had to do thus far.  it's close to the edges of the build plate and it's just not turning out like i want it to.  i've had to start the print 4 times thus far to try to tune the result so that i don't have edges lifting.  



 photo of print start. 


i'm printing using the medium quality cura profile for abs with the .5mm nozzle.  i have an enclosure and it's a toasty 110 degrees f inside, and i've disabled the fan.  no matter what i try i can't seem to get the edges farthest out away from center to stay down.  i do admit that having put the taz in my cheapy enclosure and stop using the fan it has gotten somewhat better.

i guess what i'm hoping for is either a bit of encouragement that this print job can be done or just to tell me to face the music and abandon the project.","thanks for all the help.  i was actually able to complete the job.  i found success by using brims and printing it in an enclosure.  also i had a pei full of bubbles that wasn't helping matters much.  lulzbot replaced my print bed, and now things stick better to the print bed than they did even when it was brand new, so i'm encouraged by this.  i've also bought all the parts i need to do the aluminum bed modification that piercet suggested.

kcchen_00 - thanks for the tip on the disc and square anchors.  i'll definitely think about that from now on.  

larrypage - thanks for the kick in the pants.  i figured out that i'll never make any money if i can't go beyond the simple stuff.  i also learned that i shouldn't be afraid of support material.  this print had plenty of it on some of the other parts, but it all snapped off with a little bit of work."
warning: cfl lamps can lock up your printer,"alert/information: get rid of any cfl lights or lamps you may have near to your 3d printer, last night i had a strange occurrence, i turned off my boom arm cfl (flourescent) light on my work desk and my printer just froze, my first thoughts were crap i've tripped the electric .. but the printer was still on, however the front panel was unresponsive.

(typically i leave the light on as i live stream but i was not tonight so i turned it off)

my background for those wondering my day job i test and certify electronic products and so my thoughts were that perhaps the printer was although very well made not immune to rf emissions, however upon some further research on cfls i discovered during on and off cycles cfls emit huge bursts of rf noise which i suspect has entered the printer and caused the fail for a quick test i started the printer again and ran a calibration i turned the lamp on and off a few times and sure as dammit after a few cycles the printer locked up again, will it effect all printers no but there is a possibility as the emissions levels from cfls when being power cycled far exceed the level any product needs to withstand to receive ce/ul marking

hi,
these files are available at download.lulzbot.com and devel.lulzbot.com. but they are in pdf, stl and solidworks formats. they were uploaded by the lulzbot team. so making a clone is not a problem. even without these files cloning wouldn't be a problem i guess.

taz 3 power supply upgrade,"i am currently in the process of upgrading my taz 3 to a taz 4.5/5.  basically, upgraded the z axis and the hotend but not the heated bed.  i am currently using the 24v/15a 360w power supply.  will i need the 500w power supply to get the hotend all the way up to 300c (or anywhere above 250-260c all while heating the bed up to 85-90c?","well, i thought about grabbing a pair of server power supplies on ebay.  they're usually about $25 for a pair.  12v and 47a and putting them in series (taking some grounding precautions of course) to get 24v 47a for a total of about 1200w... total overkill, however, it's $25 and the form factor is not that much bigger than the current ps."

filament near end of spool problem,"my first spool of pla is near the end. the set of the filament with the smaller radius is tight enough that it raised the spool support peg rather than unwinding, then the filament bound on itself around the spool and broke.  a weight was placed on the peg to hold it down and a new print started. the filament again tangled due to the tight set radius allowing a loop of the filament to bind under a turn around the spool, and it broke.

not measured how much filament is left, but it appears there is enough for several parts. is this a common problem? how is it handled?","thanks for the tip about the ""hook"" - the spool in question does not have one but i will look for it in the future on other spools.

tightening the idler would not help: i could not get the filament out pulling it by hand as it was a loop locked under a winding (no idea how the tangle got there).  pulling locked the tangle tighter; i had to push the loop out from under the winding - exact detail forgotten but i will watch detail if it happens again. i started a new spool rather than risk getting into a print that breaks like the last one at about 6 hours into an 8 hour run (guessing by height of partially printed parts).  the old spool now has about 1 1/2 - 1 /34 layers left now but i do not know how much was there at the start of its final run.

my duel cool fan fixture...,so i attempted to make my own version of a single fan with two points of cooling. i included some pics of mine and comparison to someone else's that i found on here. the both work but i was trying to achieve a more equal airflow from each nozzle. in the end it works like a champ but it looks a little phalic to me... if anyone's interested i'll post the downloads later...,"interesting... i like the boxy look better...    if using a round tunnel is more efficient, consider enclosing with a rectangular exterior.

truth be told, the normal duct opening is to small to allow the compressed airflow of the 40mm fan through.  you can test this by turning the fan full blast to 100%, you'll feel the air coming through the back of the fan.

with that said, diverting the airflow with the vane (splitter) is smart... but may not be necessary.  

regardless, that's a great job.  i'm looking to design something similar for the dual extruder v2, so that the extrusion from each hotend can be cooled independently."
issue with filament/extruder,"hey all,

after a brief stint of successful prints, i seem to have run into an issue with my extruder getting stuck and grinding a notch into the filament, which stops the extruder for the rest of the print.

i thought it might be the cheaper filament i ordered, but i switched back to what little filament i had from lulzbot, and got the same result when printing a test piece.

attached is a photo of the notch that gets created in the filament.

what am i doing wrong?","looking at the article, thats a stupid way to replace the fan. buying a 5 volt 40mm fan instead of routing a new fan into the printer power mains would have been trivially easy to put inline. instead they have you mess with the main power block and pull all the pins out of the pin block at once and hope you get them back in the right spot?

you most likely have one or more wires going into the incorrect spot at this point. probably the thermistor leads and the fan leads swapped, and may have fried your thermistor . it could be something else if you are lucky.  you are probably going to have to trace out the wires and make sure that the wires you think you are using are actually the pair you are supposed to be using. the ohai instructions may help some https://ohai.lulzbot.com/group/a16b1f2d ... 8cca5d62c/"
taz 5 vs robo r1 print comparison problem,"i have a robo r1 and a taz 5. 

the following attached photos are of prints from my taz 5 and robo r1 printers. the bad prints are from the taz (top of photo) and the good prints are from the robo. 

the taz is using abs and the robo is using pla. 
the taz settings are: 
1. hotend temp = range from 240-245 change in temp does not seem to fix problem.
2. bed temp = range from 110-115, trying 115 for first few layers then change to 110 for the rest of the print, this did not seem to fix the problem. 
 i have also included an attachment of the ini print file from the taz.

if you look closely at the photos the problem is in how the taz prints the sharpness of the gears as compared to the robo.

i would appreciate any suggestion on what i am doing wrong with the taz.","those printed flat side down and mushroomed out to the wider top part correct? 

it looks like you are overextruding a bit, and it starts to catch up to you at about layer 12 or so. what infil percentage were you printing at? if you were anywhere near 100%, try droping it down 15% or so. red abs is also one of those wierd colors that seems to have a range of temperatures it likes from different manufacturers, depending on the pigment. i would try dropping the temperature a bit and seeing if that helps, possibly 235 or even 230. bed temperature shouldn't be the issue at this point, as you are getting good adhesion and the teeth closest to the bed are printing fine. if they were lifting then you would want to raise things. 

the other potential issue is heat. abs almost never wants a fan. thin protruding overhang gear teeth are one of the few times where it might help. if you have a chassis fan, try turning it on at layer 12 at about 35% and see if that also makes any difference

edit: after looking at the ini file, i see you have filliament diameter set at 2.85. filliament is almost always slightly above or below that number, you will want to measure with calipers and change that value to match. this is especially important with smaller nozzles. also aan 88% infil might be a bit high to start with that part, especially if you are overextruding."

here is a 3dbenchy i printed the other day http://imgur.com/a/lqqrj (formfutura premium black pla, 50mm/s, 180°, 0.2mm layer height) as well as a make overhang test http://imgur.com/a/zezxq (formfutura premium black plan, 50mm/s, 180°, 0.1mm layer height)
i realize that filament can play a fairly big role in output quality so i can *sort of* understand the zits and blemishes on the benchy but i am disappointed with the overhang test - should i be? are all of my worldly problems filament related?

i've also had a few problems with heat creep into the hotend barrel - will all my problems(which i see to be cooling based) be minimised if i upgrade to the mangrove/nutmeg(?) toolhead mount as discussed here viewtopic.php?f=36&t=3238
currently, i see this as my only real option as pretty much everything with even an overhang comes out slightly borked at best. i have spools of pla, abs and hips. i've only ever printed with pla. if the solution is to go for the toolhead mount, can i print it out of pla or is that just asking for trouble?","tetris wrote:billyd wrote:anyway this post may come off as a bash of the taz and it isn't. i love my taz 5 now. the promise of the taz 5 is amazing. i am getting great prints after addressing most of these issues. but out of the box, as is the case with 99.9% of the consumer grade 3d printers, the taz needs a lot of work.

i don't think you come off as bashing the taz particularly hard. i have owned 4 other printers before i bought my taz 5 - 2 fff (an ultimaker original with some mods and an ultimaker original clone(don't ever buy a clone - it's crap)) and 2 sla printers (a littlerp and an uncia) and so far, the taz 5 has given me the worst experience(despite the messiness of resin printing). i read many reviews and watched as many youtube videos as i could find and narrowed my printer choice to the taz 5 and ultimaker 2. i ended up going with the taz 5 something i currently regret(i would like to get to a point where this isn't the case and seeing what some others have done with their machines, i do think it's possible). the one thing i didn't do was delve deep into these forums but i didn't think i needed to as i didn't read any major negative experiences from anyone anywhere else(yeah, that was dumb but most people seem to not have any cooling problems). everyone was running around touting the brilliance of the printer and then when make magazine crowned it, i was sold.

out of the box, the taz 5 that i received has been a tale of annoyance and frustration. i am getting the z-ribbing which can supposedly be fixed by removing the bearings, the part cooling for pla printing is horrendous which can be fixed by changing the toolhead mount to allow for more cooling fans and the mini blower fan is giving up the ghost which means i can't even print in pla anymore because i get too much heat creep and the hotend jams after about 3-5 minutes of printing which again, can be fixed either by calling support and having them send a new fan or by upgrading to a better (probably axial) fan which i will hopefully manage to do this weekend. then, there's the issue of the motion - i see that there's the option to fix again, by upgrading either the rods to hardened rods and linear bearings instead of the igus bearings or even going piercet's route and going for linear rails. the motion system isn't the major issue for me - at the price point, i can understand they needed to keep costs down so went the igus route. it seems that this is a known issue that many people have and i feel that aleph objects should at least have a hardened rod/bearing upgrade kit that you can buy as a ""pro"" option.

i am really frustrated because i bought the printer in december and have yet to print out something with a decent overhang - see the original post in this thread. i am just kicking myself because there's a local reseller for ultimaker where i could have got an ultimaker 2 and with our consumer protection laws, i could easily have returned it at no cost to me if it had turned out to be a lemon. i just wish i'd gone that route because the um original was an amazing machine that printed really well even before i did any mods on it.

also, i had a rather unpleasant exchange with one of the founders on a different forum where instead of trying to assist me with my problem or offering tweaking suggestions or even pointing me to this forum, he blamed the problem on bad filament(formfutura black premium pla) or more specifically the fact that aleph objects have no profile for it and when i said i wasn't satisfied with that as a solution because it wasn't a solution and asked for pointers to correct the issue he just said ""then return it"" which is something i'd rather avoid as i would lose out on $800 because of the shipping, return shipping and import costs involved (i live in south africa and there is no local reseller)

the trade off will always be between speed vs quality. patience is a virtue...

sure, patience is a virtue but i don't feel that 50mm/s is particularly fast and it is certainly not pushing the limits or this printer's capabilities. i'm unimpressed with the quality of the prints, notably the overhangs. it looks like it's really bad part cooling and i'm going for the toolhead upgrade that piercet suggested. dual cooling fans will hopefully do the trick and then i can look at all the other upgrades to make it a really good machine but for now, every time i look at it, i get annoyed.

in closing, it seems that i should have expected print quality of a sub $1000 printer out of the box. once i have completed discojon's tool head mount upgrade i will report back.

i had similar feelings about the taz in the beginning. i stayed with the printer because i knew i could make it better. unfortunately like i said there are few consumer level printers that are perfect. even with the glowing reports of the u2... i have seen parts printed by them and they are nowhere near the quality i get with my modded r2 and even now with my modded taz 5. remember any printer can print something pretty well slowly. but who wants their printer to take 12 hours to print something that should take 4? i don't. so there is that to consider.

consumer grade 3d printers for the most part are research projects. and a lot depends on the end user and what they expect. like i said in the other post some people are happy if the print looks recognizable and doesn't fall apart when they take it out of the printer. others, like myself, are unhappy unless the print is printed fast and looks injection molded.

i will say that filament quality has a huge impact on the printer and can make or break many prints. i have had recent experiences with a print that simply would not print well and it was driving me crazy. so on a whim i changed to a different color, which also happened to be a different brand, and the print came out perfectly! it's really hard for the printer to give good quality when the filament diameter changes along the length substantially. many cheaper brands (and some expensive ones) have constantly fluctuating diameter which will wreak havoc with a print. btw i have had excellent results with gizmo dorks abs 2.85mm filament. it's relatively cheap and very consistent in diameter. highly recommend it. amazon carries it."
removing set screws on motors,"ok, so i had my printer apart yesterday so that i could install piercet's anti-z wobble setup (thanks piercet for the great support!!) and i figured, well, i'm in deep, might as well add dampeners to the motors. so broke out my trusty allen keys from lulzbot (ok, they were already out), and attempted to loosen the set screw(s) on the cog attached to the x-axis motor. no dice. honestly, i was afraid that if i applied any more force, i would strip the head.

so, i moved on to the z-motors. i figured i can at least do those. no dice. applied as much force as i felt comfortable applying and the set screws would barely budge.

so am i being chicken, or is there some voodoo i need to know in order to get these bad boys to loosen?",i will say i worked on a motor a couple days ago that had had the hex wrench broken off inside the set screw so be careful. it is really hard to drill out with a hardened steel piece inside it.  
small fan on taz 5,"hello!
i have a taz 5, and i was wondering if the small fan (or at least the smallest fan) it is supposed to be on all the time? and i dont mean on while im printing, but on all the time, i notice that im not printing and nozzle temperature is set to 0 and the fan is still running, is there a way to turn it off when not using the printer or it has to be on all the time?

thank you, and sorry if the question was ask before, but could not find it.

broke the glass panel on taz5,"hey guys, 

someone from my team printed a large object and took it off the bed before cooling, breaking the glass.

squashing on bottom of abs parts,"i've been printing petg lately, and switched to abs. i know you guys will recognize this issue, but i don't know the cause. i'm getting flaring at the base (hard to see in images, but clear to the touch)  and my round holes are squished (clearly related). is this a bed temp or a nozzle temp issue?

i'm using the standard abs profile for .22 medium quality. i have my filament diameter set at 2.99 (that the avg. i'm getting from my hatchbox abs).

nozzle temp @ 240
bed temp @ 105 (started with 110)

i tried lowering the bed by 5 deg. until i got to 95. that invoked warping. so back to 105. that seems to hold, at least for this part.

as always, thanks for the help!

petert","elephant's foot flaring at the base of a part is normal with default settings. it's designed to give the part the best potential adhesion possible by making the first layer extrude over 100% of the reccommended amount of plastic to get a good ""squish"" to the bed. you can back that number down by 15% or so (first layer extrusion percentage or something like that, no idea where it is in cura). 

you may also have some overextrusion going on there in addition to the wobble. the extruder calibration might need to be adjusted when you get time. for now you might want to back the filliament diameter a bit lower than actual to compensate. your bed temperature should be fine."
taz5 vs. makergear m2,"i’m a retired programmer, and i got into 3d printing late last year, seduced by barnes and noble’s $249 price on an xyzprinting da vinci jr. printer.

i’ve had a lot of fun with it (and sketchup), learning how to clear filament jams, replacing damaged bowden tube fittings (my fault, but at least amazon sells ‘em in 10-packs for $6.00), tweaking the z offset (no bed leveling on this entry-level printer) in tenth-millimeter increments because the black pla is “thicker” than the colored pla filaments), and the importance of temperature control to keep prints from warping. 

i have some use for these things: my local mustang car club holds annual car shows, and i can print fun stuff for the goodie bags participants get, and table decorations for the awards banquet. i collect old computers and calculators, many of which have plastic parts that have disintegrated with age. 

anyway, as i said, it’s been a fun few months, but now i’m running up against the limitations of the hardware and xyzware software. as you probably know, the da vinci jr. is “locked down” and cannot use third party filament or slicing software, so i’m looking to upgrade to a more capable and versatile machine.

ideally, i’d like a dual-extruder setup— if not initially, at least something that could be upgraded. (one of the things i’d like to print for the car show is little ford key fobs, with an inset “ford” logo in a different color material). open source appeals to me greatly, and my short list now comprises the lulzbot taz 5 and the makergear m2. both seem like excellent machines, and both have active user communities. i will note that the luzlbot wins points for having a very detailed 40-step illustrated guide on installing and configuring their dual extruder setup, culminating in the printing of…drum roll…a key fob with an inset logo in a contrasting color!

i have of course spent several days researching these two printers, and reading the forums. still, i thought it would be a good idea to get input from people vastly more experienced and knowledgeable than myself, so my question to you taz 5 owners is: why did you choose this printer over the m2? what do you see as its advantage?

thanks for all responses…","with the rods, this is just a minor annoyance that doesn't seem to bother most users. both the taz and mini work out of the box, and that is what counts. for me, i am extremely demanding, expecting every job to start without manual intervention. plus i am adding several pounds more extruers, lasers, microscopes, milling spindles, etc. so take my recommendation there with a grain of salt. 

for the mini, alignment is usually a non-issue. some users seem to have problems with the probing mechanism, but it has worked extemely well for me at hacdc. it definitely serves the 'just print impulse' without fuss, but also provides excellent print quality.

regarding filament diameter, some users have reported carefully using 1.75mm filament without any modifications to the machine. however, 3mm is the standard size lulzbot taz and mini extruders use. failing all else, imo, it is worth using the ebay exchange service - 1.75mm filament is terrible.

many enclosures for the lulzbot taz and mini have been designed and shared on the forums. honestly though, i've printed hips, abs, and pla, without seeing much need for an enclosure. automatically generated fan speeds from slic3r seem able to maintain almost any part at just the right temperature throughout printing.

as for the airwolf axion dual extruder setup, it always seems odd to see expensive machines using bowden tubes with cartesian mechanics. either the machine should be much cheaper, it should be capable of moving heavier tools.  doesn't seem like a fair deal. also, airwolf seems to like that word ""proprietary"", which is a bit strange considering the reprap community's roots...

fwiw, i have a misadventure story related to airwolf dual-extrusion printers. a 3d hubs operator accepted a job for me that was supposed to be done with pva support material on an airwolf machine. after about a week of waiting for their support to address g-code slicing errors, he finally printed it on a makerbot. for lack of build area or dissolvable support material, he had to acetone glue the parts together. to the operator's credit, communication was excellent and professional."

leaves extra extrusion on the back of a fill but not front,"just printing more and getting to know my taz 3.  why does it seem to leave extra extrusion (to a point that it's too much) on one side of the fill but not the other side?  so as it swings back and forth, more is left on my side than the other?",sounds like an out of level bed or axis. a picture would help.
my extruder mount is rocking!,"and not in a good way. it has a fair amount of play between the bearings and the x axis rods. is this normal?

when i hold the extruder in my hand when facing the front of the printer i can rotate the extruder assembly right and left maybe 1 or 2 degrees. the play is coming from the bearings whose id is larger than the x axis rods diameter. i realize there needs to be a slight difference, but i think it is too large.

is this ""normal"" for the taz 5?","@muggs
i love the bowden conversation!  

it is an idea that i've pondered a while on. while i like the bowden idea and i think how the ultimaker line of printers are setup is the best way to implement a bowden setup.

why i won't put it on a taz:
1) the bed still moves and already has a greater mass than a single extruder so it can provide a lot of force when using high acceleration. granted the mechanics of the bed allow for far less flexing of the frame but with a big build volume there is the potential that the whole moving bed + plastic on it could weigh quite a bit.
2) the tpe world is pretty much un-functional in a bowden setup as far as i know. squishy plastics gotta be hard to run through almost a meter of ptfe tubing without having oozing or non extrusion points. i already have to retract 3mm and have a 0.5mm z lift to keep some of these nylons from stringing all over, i would think this issue would become a nightmare with a bowden. this leads to #3.
3) with the extra long retractions and high z lifts needed for some of the ""fancier"" filaments i would think that the speed you'd gain from higher accelerations would be washed out.
4) the whole machine is designed for a direct drive system so things like the z drive system would be way slow and overkill for just a nozzle on a carriage. i'm sure there are more things.
when i would put it on a taz
5) a bowden would be great front nozzle on a flexidually. this is where the bowden would become a reality for me and the taz. keep the nozzle center of gravity way closer to the x plane if the bowden is out front. then the ""fancy"" filaments can always be run on the back nozzle and the bowden could be saved for abs, hips, pla and other bowden friendly plastics.

got any other ideas? i'm but only moderately versed in physics and mechanics so i'm sure i've overlooked some points"
some calibration questions,"now i'm starting to print some parts that need to be as accurate dimensionally as possible, i've decided to try calibrating the steps for each axis for the first time.

i've been taking measurements from each side of both the x and y axis' and they don't match. for instance i set the steps at one side of the printer moving the x or y in one direction and it's perfect, i then go to the other side of the printer moving it the opposite way and it's some way off. what i've done for now is set the steps at halfway between the calculation for either side and, although neither direction is moving to a hundredth of a milimetre accuracy, it's at least moving the same distance each way, but a 100mm movement isn't quite exactly 100mm.

is this the correct way to do it?

the z axis i calibrated using a 10mm movement and my dial gauge, and that seems to be absolutely spot on.

another question is, is there a way to raise/lower either end of the y axis? when fine tuning the height of each side of the x axis, ive found the the aluminium plate is actually sitting 0.5mm higher at the back end, which could go some way to explaining the 0.1mm dip i have right across the centre of the bed due to twisting. or is this normal?

thanks in advance.","the stock x and y steps values in the taz firmware should be very accurate, they are designed to allow for 1% plastic shrinkage on cooling. if your measurements are off, it may be to a loose belt. the best way to ensure that x and y are accurate and true is to print a hollow cylender. the outer diameter and the inner diameter of the cooled part should be the same in any direction and match your intended dimension, and the wall thickness should be uniform. if it is off in either x or y direction with the values otherwise the same in firmware, it indicates one of the belts is loose enough that it has some slack in it allowing for excess travel. if the walls are too thick or thin it usually indicates overextrusion or underextrusion. if all of the dimensions across the board are too big or too small, then you want to look at the firmware values. 

as far as the difference from one side of the bed or x axis to the other, it could be the part offset of the belt. the motor shaft doesn't have a recieving bearing, so it can deflect a tiny amount. it's not really enough to be noticible, but it might account for your difference. 

the y bed plane is adjustable by adding shims under the main frame rails and feet if you want.  there is a small chance that the main frame to bed bolts are pulling the heat set inserts out of the blocks as well. i thought about makign a variant of the openbuilds y axis with adjustable leveling feet, but i haven't got around to that project yet. 

the dip you are seeing in the bed isn't the bed, its rod deflection due to gravity. a 0.05mm dip is normal, but you might just have a really heavy dial gauge. the only way to eliminate that dip are: 1. hardened 10mm rods, 2, larger (12mm) rods, taz 6 prototype style, or 3. a boxed rail (take a look at the openbuilds rail taz modifications in the development forum)"

issues printing taller objects.,"hey all,

i'm having some issues with taller abs prints in my lulzbot taz 4, using an updated version of slic3r and the fast_abs_no-support_pt35nzl_pt27layer-11s.ini profile, modified only to add a 3mm brim.

i've been seeing some layer splitting, and i wonder if it has something to do with my printer being in my basement, where its a tad drafty.

attached is the ini, the gcode, an stl file and some images of the issue i'm having.

thanks for your time,

~~adam","printing tall thin objects with abs is a challenge, which takes skill, know how and a very well dialed in printer to do right, and oftentimes an enclosure is required to get the proper results. 

to start with, white filliament in general is a pain in the ass to print. whatever pigment they use to make it white seems to require either a 5 degree hotter than normal or colder than normal temperature, with no rhyme or reason as to why. generally for better layer adhesion on tall thin abs items, you are going to want to go hotter. with a taz 4, you are limited by the buddaschnozzle to how hot you can safely go. 240c which is the minimum to prevent those splits, is about failure temperature of the buddaschnozzle. you should strongly consider getting a hexagon or similar hotend at this point (a hexagon would let you upgrade to 5 firmware without needing to change anything else, just add a pei sheet if you haven't already) . you really want to try it at 250c if you can get there. 

if that doesn't do the trick, try turning on the skirt option in your slicer. this will create a 1 filliament wide  container surrounding your print and following it up, starting at the edge of the brim. what that does is act as a wind break and thermal insulator, trapping warm air next to the print and preventing it from splitting. you can manually extrude such a shield into a design when making it as well as needed.  if you can, thicken the walls of the part 2-3mm, that will reduce the splitting considerably. 

skirt wastes alot of filliament, so many people opt to just flat out build an enclosure. since you are in a basement, thats probably going to be your best long term option. there are a couple people selling enclosure kits in the hardware development section of this forum, or you can find several plans for diy ones in the ""all of the mods"" thread viewtopic.php?f=36&t=2378 

other things that will improve layer adhesion include stiffening the x and y axes, and removing the bow in the rods. there are various methods available to do that."
longevity of taz stepper motors,"just curious if we have some long term taz users who have been printing a good amount monthly that can tell us about the reliability of the stepper motors. i was thinking today that on most larger prints i do these motors are really put to work and i was wondering how long these things can generally take the abuse? i know they are cheap to replace so cost is not the issue. i am just curious when i will more than likely see something stop working.

thanks.

borosilicate glass bed reversible?,"i have a taz5, and i bought the new dual v2 extruder. when i was testing and trying to adjust z height (and the z height of the second extruder to the first) i did a stupid and scratched my glass bed because my second extruder height was so far lower than the first.  it actually looks like it etched the first layer of the print onto the glass. fortunately i did not damage the extruder nor break the glass...

now i have everything adjusted and level, and the prints are coming out great, except that i'm getting the etched impression on the bottom of my prints because the glass is scratched from that big fail.

i'd like to get a flat glass surface again. i've read that the glass can be sanded safely, but i think if i do that, i'll need to sand down too much and end up with a less than perfectly flat glass surface.

so before i buy a new glass bed, i wanted to know: can i just remove and reverse the glass?  is the back side also suitable for printing?","chances are you just damaged the pei surface covering your plate. this can be sanded using 1500+ grit sandpaper, and then wipe it down with a water and isopropyl alcohol solution to get the dust off. the glass plate has a silicon heater attached to the underside, and it will not be able to just be flipped. 

if the pei was severely gouged, it may need to be replaced. this can be a little tedious removing the adhesive, but it is much less expensive than buying a new bed assembly. you can find directions on the mini (same process for taz but bigger) here: https://ohai.lulzbot.com/project/mini-r ... e-repairs/

hope this helps!"
question about extruder fans,"so i have seen a few different designs posted for left-side 40mm fan upgrades, and i've noticed that if you decide to add another 40mm fan to the left side of the extruder carriage, you basically get to choose between having it replace the little 5v fan (which i did because that thing was crazy loud) or having the air flow directed towards the print to improve pla printing... then i saw some pictures of the taz 6 prototype here: http://devel.lulzbot.com/taz/mangrove/p ... ove_photos and i noticed that third fan mounted in the center of the extruder carriage, which seems like it could allow you to do both.

i don't know that much about how open source works, so i could be wrong about this, but don't they publish the dev files? the reason i ask is because i haven't seen anybody try to add this third fan on a taz 5 in my many hours of googling, and it seems like a really good idea.  being an open-source noob (and only having owned my taz for less than 2 weeks), is there a reason why people aren't trying this?","oh cool, i somehow hadn't managed to look around in these dev files until now.

 i see two fan ducts (left and right) and the extruder carriage appears to have a hole to mount a third fan, so i guess the fan in front just hangs on with the one screw? i could also just be i'm missing a piece... i'm new to this. i'll have to look again later.

i tried a few times to print and use piercets reinforced extruder mount, which i believe is based on this taz6 carriage, but i couldn't get it to fit quite right in my x-carriage... it just wouldn't seat quite right. i realize now it would probably work if i used the carriage guide for the taz6. 

i guess what i'd really like to try is piercet's reinforced carriage combined with this triple fan setup, but i may need to work on my modeling skills a bit more to make that happen. 

anyway thanks for the replies everybody!"

failed abs print,"we had a major failure on a print we left to run overnight. it looks like the print started to fail and then at some point the head lost its position and started grinding into the print bed far away from where the print was to occur. has anyone seen something like this, if so, what could cause this. we had used the curaabsfine profile with 70% infill.

","the actual gcode looks fine (see my comments below)  as does the stl file.  the part of the model that printed seems to be part of the upper sections of the model but it appears to be laying on the print bed upside down? is that right?  at this point, i'm leaning more toward a hardware issue.  it would seem as though the machine didn't home properly.

as for the gcode, there are no provisions implemented for the bed and extruder to heat up prior to printing.  they are commented out.  i assume you have been preheating manually?  i'd suggest using software control for manipulating the heaters.

nozzle got clogged,"hi,

this is about my 6th print and it stopped extruding in the middle of a print. applying some manual force to the plastic (i tried enough force to bend the axis a bit, not going to do more) it will extrude a tiny bit consistently, but it won't unclog.

what do i do about that? push a 3mm rod in there? i'm worried about damaging something.

btw anyone else has the experience that support@lulzbot is basically useless since they never respond? their phone support is amazing, but calling from europe is really expensive.","they reply pretty quickly to me. check your antispam folder? 

the nozzle usually not going to actually be clogged unless you are running crappy filliament. check your idler arm tension springs, there should be 8mm between the two washers on either side of the springs. also check the small gear setscrew. 

you will also want to get a cheap point and shoot infrared thermometer from your local tool or auto repair store ($35 u.s.) and check that the heater core is close to what it thinks it should be. 

you will also want to open the filliament chamber, clean all the plastic out of the hobbled bolt and any shavings. cut out and remove any sections of filliament with ground out c shaped sections in it. 

now move the nozzle up off the bed, heat to temperature and extrude 100mm or so. if it is extruding fine there, but not when you stay a print, you are either too close to the bed, or overextruding. or the part is lifting off the bed. when you extrude molten plastic, it is essentially a noncompressable fluid. if the nozzle tip is blocked by being too close to the bed or by the solid layer ending up too close to it because of overextrusion or lifting, it basically is the equivalent of trying to extrude through a brick wall.  it causes the solid filliament to come to a stop, which makes the hobbed bolt cut a c section out of it, ruining your print. 

an actual clog is exceedingly rare, all evidence to the contrary. if you think it really is a clog, heat the nozzle to about 160, just warm enough to be able to pull the filliament out manually. undog the extruder  latch and gently but firmly pull the filliament out of the hotend. if it wont come out, bump the temperature up a few more degrees and try again."
more apparently level bed - counter weights,"several people who have used a dial indicator have noticed that the bed appears to be bowed in the middle.  we can set the corners to be the same height, but in between the extremes of the x-axis the bed seems to come up about 7 thousandths of an inch.  this apparent bowing is believed to be due to sagging of the extruder support.  to test the assumption and to compensate, i installed counter weights that offset the weight of the extruder assembly. with the counter weights, the apparent bed bowing came down to 3 thousandths. with the counter weights in place, i was able to print a large, thin flat surface that had not turned out well without the weights.

the counter weights are very low-tech, but they work.  i used pulleys and fishing weights suspended from an enclusure that surrounds the taz.  to balance the lateral forces in the x-direction, i split the weights and mounted pulleys on the etreme left and right. the extruder assembly is suspended with about 11 ounces of weights on each side. i used fishing line to suspend the weights, so it is hard to see in the attached pictures.

hope you find this helpful.



 counter weights on left and right 



 closer look at pulleys and weight on right side 
","your idea is workable, the problem you run into is the scale between the bolts. for a smooth rod installation as a glide surface, the rods are usually either under tension (which won't work here because the required tension would distort the frame unless you had a brace of some sort) or you would typically have at least 1/4 the length of the rod buried in a rod mount exactly as shown to counter gravity. or a shorter amount with weights, etc. for a particularily long segment the tension method works better. going with a box rail, or going with thicker rods like the taz 6 prototype will probably be the most effective fix with the least amount of effort. the thicker rods is definitly going to cost less than the boxed rail approach."
question for taz / octoprint users,"a question for anyone running a taz with octoprint... have you ever seen random disconnects from the printer? the printer doesn't reset and stays at temp but octoprint indicates an error disconnect. commands are no longer sent to the printer. 

i saw this a few months ago and then it just stopped. it has again happened twice in the last couple days. i am going to slap a new usb cable on it tonight to start the troubleshooting process but just wondered if anyone else has experienced this problem. 

thanks!","random possibility...  static electricity.  it's that time of year in north america where static electricity can rear it's ugly head.  just the other night my printer kept resetting as i was going back and forth to it for a variety of test prints.  it was only after the 5th time that it reset that i noticed the slight static discharge when my skin brushed against the y rods.  i was wearing moccasin house shoes (as funny as that may sound) so static was really building up.

hope this may explain it for you."
taz 3 bed,"hello everyone,

i've just recently bought a used taz 3 and im trying to figure out the parts that are currently on it and if it's worth upgrading the parts to the taz 5.  (ive been reading a lot of topics on this) however i've run across the heated bed with part number nph pc-bd0027 and i noticed that the current part number for the taz 5 is nph pc-bd0029.  any difference?","the latest heated bed does seem to heat more evenly than the taz 3 bed did, though mine also may have been damaged at that point because it didn't heat well in one loop at all. comparing with the infrared camera though there was definitly a difference for the better. 

a taz 3 converts to a taz 5 well. you can get most of the parts to do so from http://i-t-w.com/parts . the most difficult part to source is the x end plates, which seem to be in stock at the moment so i would grab those immidiatly if you plan on doing the conversion at any point. the leadscrews and leadscrew nuts are the next hardest to find.

it is definitly worth either upgrading to 5 spec, or sourcing 12mm rods and bearings and going to taz 6 prototype spec, but that design isn't finilized yet. there are some advantages to going with the 5 spec, such as the ability to use the openbuilds modifications. to go wtih 6 spec you would need to also replace the front y axis endplate and the bed plate. you can get most of the way to 6 spec if you omit the mini style leveling without replacing the bed mount plate."
filament temperatures,"hey guys,

is there a page on the site that goes over the various filament temps for all the various materials? i know cura has them stored but i am not sure how you go about warming up the bed and nozzle prior to hitting print. 

if you select a certain filament and hit print, will cura keep the printer idle until temperatures are reached or am i supposed to get the bed and nozzle up to temperature manually before printing?","make sure you have loaded the print profile for the filament you want to use. if the extruder is cold, it's usually a good idea to to set it to the nozzle temp for the filament and manually extrude 10 mm or so to make sure the nozzle is extruding properly and ready to go. then just hit print and cura will do the rest.

here is a list of temps and setting from scottw  that he made for simplify3d that is a good place to start for most of the common filaments."
taz 5 bed adhesion,"hello all,

i have had my taz 5 for about 2 months now and it has been working great.  i have had it going pretty much 24/7 since i got it and over the last few weeks i have been noticing a change in the surface of the glass bed.  

almost all of my prints have been printed in the exact center of the bed.  i have noticed in this area where almost all of my prints are done the bed looks different when the light reflects off it.  it appears the edges around the bed (about from the edge to 2-3 inches in from the edge) look kinda dull when you look at it at an angle with with light.  however the center of the bed in 3-4 inch area looks very shiny and prints are very difficult to remove even when letting it cool down entirely.  i tested printing things on the edges more with no other change in temps or any sort of height adjustment for the z-axis and prints remove off these spots with little to no effort once cooled.  

i have already tried moving my z-axis up some without much success.  i do not believe this is the issue since when prints are more toward the corners or edges of the bed they come off effortlessly.  i am wondering if perhaps by printing in the same spot constantly or perhaps being too aggressive in getting my prints off the bed i damaged the surface somehow.   perhaps i damaged the pei surface?  honestly i know very little about how the bed is assembled or what makes it special.  i normally let the bed cool down to 20-24 degrees before attempting to remove a print.  

i have been printing with pla at 60 degree bed temp and 205 nozzle temps.  i have tried several brands of pla and that has not solved my problem.  my parts look very smooth on the bottom regardless of where on the bed i print them.  

any help would be appreciated.  

thanks,
justin","as piercet mention the head sags in the middle, bringing it closer to the bed. once you start measuring the bed levelness with a dial indicator this becomes very apparent. 

you actually would what to move the nozzle lower closer to the bed if you are doing a print that uses the edge. honestly don't be afraid to turn that endstop....  the more you do it the more comfortable you will be with it. i will sometimes turn that thing on the fly at the start of each print just to adjust for what i am printing. i just go off of how i want that first layer to visibly look (i do z height visually now). 

and don't worry about damaging your bed. unless you deeply dig into it with a knife...  or poor acetone all over it...   the only way i damage mine anymore is when the prints stick overly well...  which i need them to do for long prints. which then causes bubbling...  which is a catch 22... i hate pei, not so much the material i self but rather the inadequate adhesion to the glass plat. 

anyways if you think it is the bed.  buy some 2000 grit sand paper and go to town on it. they will say ""lightly"" sand. but that's wrong. get some elbow grease in there."
openbuilds cable chain & e3d mod for taz,"i finished adding the x-y openbuilds mod by piercet. i modified the cable chain mod for the x-y-z and wanted to share in case someone wanted to do the same. i did the x-z chain this way because my enclosure limited the vertical space for the x-axis chain when at max z.

x-z cable chain
the x-z cable chain bolts into the frame, x motor mount and x backplate. you'll need 6x m3 heat sets to screw the cable chain ends on the x-axis. for the z axis, the chain snaps into both ends. the cable chain holder screws into the belt screws from the x backplate of the openbuilds mod.
i used this cable: http://www.amazon.com/dp/b00pzmdjhe which is nice since it's open lay, in case you want to add/remove links without unscrewing or re-feeding the cable.

capacitive sensor
i modified the vitormhenrique's capacitive sensor holder to account for my larger sensor. also i used the heat set screw hole from the mangrove mount (where the ao-hex blower would be) to screw in the holder to minimize sensor movement. if you do use a capacitive sensor, i recommend using smaller bed washers for the bed holder. i'm using the ones from the taz mini which gives me enough clearance where i don't have to worry about my sensor hitting the bed corners when z is homed.

"
enclosure with electronics outside,"when building an enclosure, most people seem to provide a port or duct to allow the electronics box to be ventilated outside.  but this seems like it would bring a lot of outside air into the enclosure.  why not take the whole electronics box off and mount it on the outside of the enclosure?

if the enclosure were built right up against the left edge of the frame, this would probably only require a small amount of pulling of the cables to reach to the box (perhaps 1/2 to one inch).  the cables themselves would have to go through the enclosure wall, but this could then be sealed up.  even if poorly sealed, this still exchanges a lot less air with the outside than a ventilation duct.

is there some reason this wouldn't work?","without exhaust for your enclosure it can get it too hot for good printing on long prints. also it's nice to carry the smell and nano-particles outside and not in your lungs.

i have the electronics enclosed but i have an exhaust. i regulate the temperature by regulating the exhaust fan. but ideally it's probably best to put a thermostatically controlled heater (besides the heat bed) inside the enclosure, and turn up the exhaust fan enough to make the second heater work a little. that would keep the temperature constant and you could set it below a dangerous temp for the electronics.

i have heard of people frying their electronics from letting them get too hot. not sure what a safe max ambient is for this stuff. but i haven't had any problems with my fully enclosed taz. but again i do have an exhaust fan and duct venting to outside."
dual extruder v2 fan clearance?,"i am putting together a new dual extruder v2 and i noticed that the tiny fans for the hotends don't seem to have proper clearance.  one of them is right up against the hotend, touching it, where i presume it will melt.  the other seems farther away than on the single extruder.  i didn't see any obvious manufacturing flaws, but it just seems like... this can't be right.

taz5 - z axis steppers move at different rates?,"hi,

i recently got a taz5 and am super pleased with it.  i spent a bunch of time leveling the bed and my first prints have come out well.  i noticed though that for every ~20 hours of printing, the bed becomes out of level by ~1/2mm.  the whole right side of the bed will be further away from the extruder, while the left side is fine.  i suspect that the right-most z-axis stepper motor may be moving a hair slower than the left one, causing the issue.  i can re-level the bed prior to every print by manually turning the right-most z-axis rod/screw.  wasn't sure if anybody else has experienced this issue or has any advice.

thanks in advance
-justin","kcchen_00 wrote:i don't think the steppers are moving at different rates... i'd attribute the change in bed level to removal of parts.  specifically, the corners of the bed can ""catching"" against the bed leveling adjustment screw when accidentally pressing on the bed to remove parts.  treat this as a sign to re-level the bed.  

thanks - i thought about this, but when i first realized the problem (after a bunch of failed prints), i noticed the bed was almost a whole centimeter out of level, and the whole right side was the issue.  there's no way it's the bed adjustment screws.

i'll check the set screws.  if it's not that, i just thought of a small experiment i can run though that will help quantify the problem and prove it's not the set screws.  i'll plan on moving the z-axis up and down in fixed increments (e.g. 100mm up, 100mm back down) and then measure the gap between the extruder nozzle and the bed each time.  if i see no difference after a bunch of movement, it must be something i'm doing.  otherwise, there is something wrong."
hot end not heating up,"greetings!

i started printing and item with abs as i usually do, heated up the hot end to 230 and started printing. about 10 minutes into the print the temperature started going down without me noticing and thankfully cura prevented the printer from trying to extrude while cold.
i found it strange that the temperature dropped at all. by the time i noticed the temperature was dropping it was already down to about 160. i thought maybe for some odd reason the temperature was set to 0 and was just a strange glitch.
so i cycled the printer off and back on and told in with cura to warm up the extruder to 230. the temperature will not go up. i can set it from cura or from the lcd on the printer and it will show the goal temp but it will not heat up. i even tried touching the hot end with some abs and then my hand just to see if its actually heating up without displaying it but it was staying at room temperature.

i checked all the wires and connections, even inside the electronics enclosure and couldn't find any loose or disconnected wires.
i pulled out my multimeter to check the thermistor and heat resistor to see if they are giving the correct resistance values but the multimeter is giving me no data at all. the multimeter seems to work fine with other electronics but i'll keep testing to make sure the multimeter isn't faulty.
i did a continuity test to check if any of the cables are shorting out at all but there do not seem to be any shorts.

does anybody have any idea whats going on or what to do next for testing?
i've also been debating buying the new hexagon hot end. maybe it would just be easier to replace the hot end and save me the headache of fixing this one. i also don't want to order a new hot end and find out that something is wrong with the rambo board and be no closer to having a working printer.

thanks in advance!","if you are looking to upgrade the hexagon, i would suspect you are using a budaschnozzle? if so, it is most likely that your resistor will need to be replaced. you can verify this by testing the resistance (ohms) of the red wires (resistor.) if the resistor is functioning normally, it should read ~5ohms. if you get an open circuit, that is the piece you will need to replace.

you can find directions on replacing the budaschnozzle resistor here: https://ohai.lulzbot.com/project/budasc ... e-repairs/

taz 5 build,"hey all

first post and i need your help.

the parts i am struggling to locate  here in the uk are, 

1. threaded rods of the z axis
2. rambo enclosure (even printed ones)
3. those threaded insert things (i have searched the forum and have looked at all the links but no luck, spent hours on google searching)
4. any form of tech spec drawing of the laser cut corners (i have stl files to print but wand something more long term), y end plates and the x end plates (if anyone is willing to do any laser cutting for me and can post to uk, or is offering this already in the uk please let me know)

any success with the dual metal taz (dual v2)?,"i have spent about 15 hours in total calibrating and attempting to print with the new v2 dual extruder. i can't get consistent results. anything larger than the size of a quarter fails catastrophically. the first print that i tried with support material ended with a solid block of colorfabb ngen surrounding both extruders. i have leveled and re-leveled my bed countless times, checking all 4 corners for exact distances before and after leveling the extruder head assembly with the screw at the front. i have had my bed so level that both extruders were dragging over printed layers. each print that i have tried has had major issues with the exception of one small keychain widget. tech support can't seem to provide me with any solutions other than re-leveling my bed and making sure that the extruders are level. to redo that once more at this point would substantiate the definition of insanity.

primary issues:

""dragging"" of extruders causing delamination, imperfections on side walls of prints, catastrophic stringing, and layer separation.

ooze. even with ooze shield and wipe & prime tower, the ooze coming from high end filaments like co-polyester at lower than usual temperatures comprimises the quality of the prints.

the combination of the two issues resulting in birds nests of filament forming around extruders and destroying prints.

i am nearing my 30 day anniversary of ordering this tool head and i need to make the decision whether to keep it or return it. i really can't afford to spend any more time calibrating this thing without results, but it is a shame to even consider returning it after so much anticipation and implied possibilities.

so what i'm asking for is success stories. is there anyone in the community that has had good, consistent results with their dual v2 printing large, high detail parts? did you experience similar issues? what solutions did you implement to overcome the issues? 

thanks to any and all that can provide some insight.","kelvarnson wrote:i am about a month and a half into a dual v2.  i have had my share of heartache, but have learned a lot.

leveling in the corners is of course necessary, but i think it is crucial to follow that up by going to the center of the platform and re-homing the z axis there.  why?  because there is quite a bit of weight cantilevered forward from the x-axis guide rails due to the larger head, and i believe that it sags downward in the middle of the x-axis travel.  i am certain other people have measured and reported this.

picture the print bed as being slightly convex, that is the effect.  particularly, if you are attempting (as i was) to print with pva or some other flexible filament from the front head, you could see some problems.  pva is very flexible, and there's about three inches of travel between the feed bolt and the extruder head, where the filament is essentially unsupported.  slight back pressure caused by the head being too close to the print bed (see above) was wreaking havoc for me with the pva, it was just wadding up below the bolt.

i actually kinda bias the front head up a little bit when i am doing the leveling, i.e. paper dragging on the rear head, only very slightly dragging on the front head.  it eases the flow for the pva, and doesn't seem to negatively affect the print (and it is, after all, only my support material).

the second most important discovery for me was the wonders of a glue stick.  i was having so much trouble getting pva to stick, i tried a bunch of different things and was about to give up, but then i tried a glue stick and it worked perfectly.  too good in a few cases.  my experience was that on large prints the pva would curl up on the corners, but not so much in the middle, so my new m.o. is to just apply the stick around the perimeter to hold the edges down.

i am doing large prints using cura, with verbatim pla at 205 in the rear head, and lulzbot (esun) pva at 195 in the front head, with a 60 degree build plate.  most of the stuff i am doing i am using 0.25mm layer thickness.  it is going really well and i am getting high-quality parts with some build times going over 30 hours (i think speed will be the next thing i start working on).

your issue with all of the oozing and ""birds nests""...  do you have retraction enabled?  that might help.  i can't comment much more on that because i do not have that specific problem, although i will say that pva is just really ""oozy"", it just seems to keep dribbling out.  fortunately the mess that it causes dissolves in the water.

if you have specific questions or problems post them here and i will help if i can.

thanks for your response!

i did actually notice the same thing with the front extruder dipping in the middle of the x axis. 

i didn't have an issue with pva when i printed it. i'm not using the esun pva, i don't remember which brand my pva is. the pva support material seemed to print just fine for the most part, and i was ok with any imperfections. the ngen was where the problems really started on that print. it didn't seem to stick to the pva at all. which i could troubleshoot more, or just use a different filament. 

but the major issues for me are around printing with two colors of the same types of filaments. i have mostly been experimenting with ngen since that has yielded the best and most consistent results in single extrusion prints for me, yet i can't get anything to print without failures. i do have retraction enabled with some very robust settings which should compensate for any possible oozing, yet it still occurs. i've also taken print temperatures as low as 205 for the ngen materials and had the same results, with potentially compromised layer adhesion."
new user frustration: calibration issues?,"hi!

i got my taz5 yesterday.
i followed the manual, but it stopped after bed leveling, so i assumed that's all i have to do. (it better be for the price of a car   )
then i went and printed http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:34778  with abs at 240/110 c as recommended by https://www.lulzbot.com/taz-cura-profiles. result is: won't fit.  http://i.imgur.com/da78dpy.png   no amount of force will make that snap.

so i thought, maybe its just me being a noob, and i went and print a 30x30x3 cube. it turned out to be 30x30x3.3, except on the edges where there's significant overspill to 30.6mm. http://i.imgur.com/2xirp9s.png  so that's why the gear model won't fit at the snap-in thingies.

some googling suggests i need to set flow lower. so i tried with 50% for the sake of showing the difference. http://i.imgur.com/ob9jk9r.png it's 29.6 now, except at the edges where it overflows to 30.1.   at 80% fow i get 29.9 and 30.4.. etc.

uuuh.. what do i do? the machine doesn't ... look bad, so i guess it's a software thing that is supposed to make sure it stays less at the corners maybe? doesn't happen with other printers.

thanks!","there's another thread about this on the front page called getting prints to the right size or something similar. there's some very useful tips in there.

i have been trying similar, i've never needed high tolerances until now so originally set the printer up to get a reasonable print and left it be.

now i've set my target to get within a tenth of a millimetre accuracy in both height and width, i don't know if that's a tight tolerance for a 3d printer or not, whilst i've had my printer the best part of a year, for what ive printed until now simple adjustments to get reasonable but consistent prints have been enough.

i've managed to get my esteps absolutely bang on. ive measured, remeasured, and triple measured filaments at lots of different points. i also bought a dial gauge and got the four corners spot on, although mentioned in another thread i have a .1mm sag in the centre (that's with the whole print head carriage removed and the dial gauge and its bracket don't even weigh a fraction of the former, so it doesn't account for x axis sag which i haven't measured).

i've spent the last two days attempting to fine tune the z axis stop, and tiny changes in height make massive differences. i've managed to get to within .3mm horizontal and vertical accuracy printing a small 4.4mm w x 4mm h part at all four corners and the centre, with the z set at .11mm above the centre of the print bed. i don't know if that would be considered high or low but a piece of paper will slide effortlessly under the nozzle at that height. it has also brought the best results print quality wise that i have managed so far. the prints are coming out slightly wider and taller than they should be. i think that points at overextrusion.

i'm sure all this has been discussed in detail many times previously, but using google throws up thousands of results, pretty much all of which ive looked at refer to the paper method. when set to a piece of paper, my nozzle always eventually ends up rubbing into a part of the print and causes chaos.

i'm also beginning to wonder if the z axis wants to be changed to match whatever layer height you're printing at, which is something i'm going to look at tomorrow. is there a reason the first and top layers are set to be smaller than the rest in the lulzbot cura profiles? or is it good practice to set every layer at the same height?"
cant get prints to correct size,"so i have had a taz 5 for about a month now and love everything about the printer except when it comes to fitting pieces together.  i have spent hours looking through forums and you tube for videos but i am hoping someone out there can help me.  

every thing i print the interlocks is so tight and never fits.  never never never.  so i made a basic test cube in tinkercad.  30mml x30mmd x20mmh  i also made a 20x20x20 hollow cube and centered it inside.  this way i could measure outside x & y and inside tolerances.   what i found was my printer is printing bigger then 30mm on the x & y by about .3mm and i was also printing to much material on the inside.  my print is coming out as follows

30.32x30.28x20.02mm  and the inside is measuring 19.81mm x 19.83mm x 20.002mm. 

after this i did some research and looked into setting estep properly.  i adjusted this to 853.1mm in the firmware which is as close to perfect as i can get when dispensing 100mm of filament.   reprinted the test cube and now it is closer but still not close enough.  i can post the exact measurements this afternoon but i don't know what i'm doing wrong and how to fix it.  i have been trying to print this for my 6 year old

https://www.youmagine.com/designs/star- ... ex-version

i had a buddy print it and the pieces snap together and twist lock no problem on his ultimaker.  i for the life of me can not get these things to print and fit.  i break them every time by trying to force them into each other.  how can i as a noob calibrate this printer to print a 20x20x20 cube?  do i need to calibrate x/y?  i assume those are set correctly.  i have never changed anything besides the esteps.","paulmorley wrote:great thread josh.  i've had my taz 5 since may 2015 and have struggled getting a firm handle on the extrusion rate as it relates to getting perfectly fitting printed objects as well.  i also printed the same light saber you mentioned and it's one of the better prints i've done.  you can see some pics here.  viewtopic.php?f=32&t=2764&p=16797&hilit ... ber#p16797.

as it relates to getting perfectly fitting prints, you're findings are very interesting that you've had to go as low as 85% on the 'flow %'.  i've never tried that low as i always assumed this would adjust the flow rate directly and i would never have imagined that 85% would extrude enough.  moreover, all the reading i've encountered suggests that if you get your e-steps right (which i've spent a lot of time doing, like you) then the 'flow %' shouldn't need to be adjusted in theory.

here's the snippet out of the cura manual relate do the 'flow %'.

filament flow %
this controls how much filament your printer is extruding in relation to
speed. this setting is mainly used to adjust for filament density variations.
leave this value at 100% as changing it can lead to surface quality issues.

now i'm completely confused as i'm not really sure what this means.  ...extruding in relation to speed???  and filament density variations??  and if the suggestion is to leave it at 100%, why is it a feature at all...  still scratching my head on this one.  what do you make of it?


i'm no expert, but i'll give you my take on your questions.  

you're on the right track, but probably need to take a step back and stop over-analyzing.  

there are a lot of ways to adjust the proper amount of filament deposited during the extrusion process.  proper e-steps is the basis, so make sure when requesting 10mm, the stepper motor advances/feeds 10mm of filament.  make sure that you have a good average for filament diameter.  the flow rate falls in line with adjusting the proper amount of deposited filament, but in a much quicker fashion.

filaments come in various formulas but in general still fall into the general family of abs, pla, pet...etc.  again, i'm not an expert on filaments, but i suspect different brands use more or less filler which could dissipated during the extrusion process.  so the flow rate allows adapting to these differences quickly without wasting a quarter of the spool figuring out the new esteps... only to do it again for the next spool.

i believe there is some relationship between flow rates and speed.  the slicing software should be smart enough to make compensate, but in some case you may want to increase the flow rate when speeding up prints.

regardless, the easiest way to gauge proper flow rate is visually inspecting the top layer.  measuring and fitting is good too, but generally if your top layer is a bit rough where the layer infill overlaps with the perimeter... best seen when using a rectilinear pattern for the top solid layer infill.

if your machine, filament... everything is dialed in correctly, leave flow rate at 100%.  for any other circumstance, vary flow rate to suit the project or your liking.  

hope that helps... and again, i'm no expert... so maybe others can chime in."
think i've destroyed my nozzle. advice?,"to cut a long story short, i managed to clog on my taz 5 switching from abs to nylon, got down to last resort after some time using google and got the blowtorch on the nozzle. 

the thing i read said to heat for approx a minute til the smoke and yellow flame is gone, i heated for about 15/20 seconds before the brass completely discoloured and i stopped immediately. it got most the nylon/abs mix out of the nozzle but there's still some incinerated crud burned onto the bottom and i still can't see through the nozzle.

i tried poking wire through it but it was really flimsy and just curled and probably scratched the inside of the nozzle.

i'll be buying a replacement tomorrow, but it's works printer and work will be needing it tomorrow so i really need to get this nozzle serviceable if at all possible if only for a day.

is it just a case of putting on a brave face and giving it the heat? or does anyone have any other ideas? is the nozzle likely to be wrecked?

also, will replacement nozzles have to be the same as the one that comes on the hexagon hot end? i've seen some with a hex shaped nozzle which a socket would fit over, that would be better for me as i could use my torque wrench to tighten instead of having to guess by hand with a spanner.

thanks for any tips/advice.","piercet wrote:the hexagon shaped ones are e3d v6 nozzles, which are compatable with the hexagon. 

every time i hear the words ""blow torch"" and ""3d printer"" in the same sentance, i cringe. alot. did yiou at least remove the thermistor and the heater core from the assembly before you tried that? 

assuming you didn't cook your electronics, try heating the nozzle to 160c, turn it off, then use a tight fitting crescent wrench on the block as a backing bar and a smaller crescent wrench on the nozzle to remove it. (wear gloves) assuming the nozzle doesn't strip, you should then be able to clean it and potentially reuse it. acetone will eat any residule abs, not sure what would eat nylon.

the nozzle has been removed from the hot end, don't worry. it would have been insane taking a blowtorch near the printer itself. taking the blowtorch direct to the nozzle was a last resort after a 2 day acetone soak, then the heated nail trick, also tried manually screwing a screw in but both achieved nothing more than making a hole in the soft spongey filament stuck inside.

i managed to clear the nozzle tip after another overnight soak in acetone and finally getting the wire through. fingers crossed it will print ok today.

good to know about those hex shaped nozzles, they'll be much easier to remove and reinstall. are they still of the same quality? has anyone used different nozzles?"
dual extruder v2 filament guide bracket,"i was doing a 30+ hour-long print with the new dual extruder v2, using pla and pva.  because of the design, the machine was laying down a significant amount of pva before even starting the pla.  the repeated flexing of the pla where it enters the head resulted in it breaking, which of course ruined the print job.

also, pva filament is very limp, and i wanted to hold it upright so it wasn't entering the print head at an angle.

in response, i decided to design and print a head-mounted filament guide retainer.  i present it here for everyone's free use and modification.  i was in a hurry, and i knocked out the design in about three hours, so it could still use a little refinement.  if i get around to doing that i will post updates.  in the mean time, this one is functional.

for mounting, i decided to use the main print head retention screw.  i took out the stock one and replaced it with another that is m3 x 25mm.  this leaves a number of threads sticking out the back for the bracket to mount to: 






(by the way, note the black pla filament that is white from fatigue where it enters the head).

the underside of the bracket follows the contours of the x carriage and the extruder frame, and that takes care of positioning and allows just the single retention nut.  i used a vertical slot rather than a hole, which allows the bracket to be lifted upwards to access the extruders by just loosening the kep nut.  there is a circular depression that is the size of the kep nut washer, so that locks it in vertically when the kep nut is tightened:  






the filaments pass through 4mm holes that are counterbored 6.35mm by 12.7m deep on the top to accommodate the filament guides.  they need to be a friction-fit to hold the guides in place; honing them with a 1/4"" drill bit made it work perfectly.  here's what it looks like installed:




 





i am attaching an stl file, and also a step file in case anyone wants to modify the design.  improvements that need to be made:

-a slight enlargement of the mating surface where it meets the head and the carriage, to make it less of a snug fit.

-the filament holes are not quite perfectly aligned.

comments are welcome, of course...

.","great idea! after noticing such movement and conflicting torsion between the guide tubes, i had thought about doing the same thing.

seems like you might be having better success with the dual v2 if you're pulling off 30 hour prints with pva support. the last one that i tried similarly to that failed catastrophically. actually, i haven't had any success with large parts printing with my v2 yet. i started a thread about it, looking for solutions before i pull the plug on trying to use it and return it to ao. would you mind sharing any insight you have?

thanks so much!"
i am guessing breathing these fumes all day no good??,"i have my taz 5 behind my desk in my office and i notice the fumes of abs in particular are pretty bad. since it is petroleum based i am guessing this is not the best thing to be taking into your lungs all day. i didn't notice much from pla though i guess because it's plant derived. 

so my question is does anyone know about the toxicity of pla vs abs vs hips?

also have any of you built simple enclosures with venting?

thanks for your input ....

chris","there are few studies about this at present. the key points are:

* have good ventilation,

* eastman amphora based filaments, by design, emit less than abs, pla, etc. these include colorfabb_xt, n-gen, chromastrand, and n-vent (?) from taulman.

* pla is better than abs.

* hips and abs are about the same.

* not all materials are the same--for instance, some abs filaments perform differently than others and are of different composition.

there is a recent paper that covers many of these topics and they test a lulzbot mini with 9 filaments!   right now it is behind a login-wall to download and we can't share it, but the author has suggested it may be made freely available. we're looking into testing more filaments.

sneeze guard idea,"work is buying me a taz 5 which rocketh mightily after two years of budget printer use.  now i'll have the best there is, some say, and i want to build a good enclosure for it.  

well i see the plexi box approach, the wooden box approach, even the styrofoam box approach... and it seems like something a bit lighter might do the job.  you see, the heated bed makes the printbed area plenty warm i imagine as it did on my first printer (robo3d), and we all know that heat rises so why do we need a full box enclosure?  

i'm thinking of a salad bar or buffet food bar where they have the cover that you can see thru yet serves an important function.  i mix that in my mind with the notion that heat is escaping upward and needs to be contained somewhat but maybe not completely...

so how about a clear cover that is like a salad bar, angled down front and back and angled or even rounded on the sides, keeping the rising heat inside of it.  then we have three zones:  bottom zone is hot, top zone is hot, middle zone gets heat from below and from above, so middle zone is hot.  

i bet if i build a salad bar covering the top 1/3 of my taz 5, i could measure a thermal profile that was even enough for most tasks, yet does not put my taz 5 in a box, so to speak.

make history!","i'm going to be looking at building mine this week hopefully. i'll probably make it out of polycarbonate. forget laser cutting and all that, it will cost a bomb, jigsaw and a drill and some sealant along the joins.

i'm actually going to make two, a little one for the filament to sit in joined together with a fan and some car turbo pipes i've got knocking about. i think it's the only way i'll manage to print fair sized nylon prints at my workplace.

drafts are the worst things ever for abs, specially at work where doors get left open and you get kept busy so the printer can be running a long time without being checked up on. i've had some horrible messes to clean up."

[solved] done goofed and now my printer won't turn on,"heyo,

so i've been having a bad time with my taz 5 which i bought last year - my prints have been looking horrible due to ineffective part cooling which i have tried to rectify but haven't had success. my solution was then to double up the fans but i only had 12v fans and a little buck converter but, like a fool, i installed the converter backwards and then when i turned the fan on, everything shut down.

i am still getting 24v in at the blue connector that comes out of the power supply but the lcd isn't coming on and if i move the bed, it doesn't flash either. i've opened the electronics control box and the big blue 15a fuse is still fine and nothing smells of smoke but no leds on the board go on. have i fried my rambo?

any ideas?","yep, looks like it you're probably correct. fuse f3 is reading what appears to be open circuit which is a positive sign i guess.
further retardation is that while i unplugged the power, i forgot to unplug the usb cable when i first tried to remove the fuse and so there was a spark. i hope that i didn't kill the board with that dumbass maneuver.

i can't get hold of the  0488005 fuses where i am but it seems that the  0451005 should do fine so i'll order some of those and hopefully i'll get them by wednesday at which point, i will be able to give some feedback"
retraction problem.  ideas?,"i recently got a taz 2, and i'm having a wonderful time with it.  most things i print are coming out great, but there's one small issue that i'm hoping someone can with me with.  the issue is with small models with lots of rapid retractions; the filament seems to slip further and further until it eventually backs all the way out of the print head.  here's a prefect example of one that does it:




the base prints great, but the pins don't print at all.  after the first layer or two of the pins, the filament has backed all the way out.

if i turn retraction off, the problem goes away, but there is lots of stringing.  i've tried 1.6mm and 1.0mm of retraction, and i suppose i could fix the problem by messing with the ""extra length on restart"" option in slic3r, but that seems to be fixing the symptom and not addressing the root problem.  i tried tightening the feed tension screws a bit (to about 8mm), but i don't want to overdo anything.  the hobbed bolt is clean, head temp stays at 230c, occasionally dipping to 229c (i'm printing abs).

i have all of 4 days experience with 3d printing, and i'd love to hear from some of you more seasoned folks about what else i can try.","you may want to reslice the model with the following changes:

; layer_height = 0.2 (slic3r > print settings > layers and perimeters > layer height/first layer height)
; perimeters = 1 (slic3r > print settings > layers and perimeters > vertical shells > perimeters (minimum))

once changed, load the model you want to cut in the plater tab and use the export g-code button to recut the model and regenerate the new gcode file with the new settings.

your extruder idler washer measurement is close to mine, i find that i get great/reliable prints at 5.1mm. how does changing those two values in your slicer configuration change the print? can you post the slic3r config you are using (file > export config)?"
abs microclimate,"this is my attempt at meeting the following requirements to improve abs output:

1. very low cost
2. very light weight materials and heat rated 110c+
3. 60c+ air temp
4. keep steppers, extruder, rambo and filament within suggested operating temp
5. easily removable
6. print duration less than 7 hours

as a result, i built an expandable type of pizza box that really just isolates the build area from everything else. i designed it around the constraints of the taz itself with minimal intrusion on the platform. if anyone is interested i will post results after some testing. the topper weight a little more than a nema 17 in hand - less than 16oz. either with the ceramic space heater or the built in bed it will maintain 70c.","this seems original and creative - well done!  i have an idea like yours but a little different, as it is open not closed.  have a look at this post:

brand new taz5 extruder problems,"hi all,

just got my new taz 5 for christmas. today i set it up and went through the ""quick start guide"". when i got to the part where the printing begins (using bed_calibration.gcode) i ran into problems. i noticed right away that the first layer was very inconsistent with beads in places and very thin lines in others. i leveled the bed *several* times and checked the relative levels of the x and y axes using a digital micrometer. all of that seems fine. i raised the z axis up and did a bunch of extruding via the control panel in cura. that worked just fine, too (although i'm not completely sure what a problem would look like). i'm using abs from ic3d. originally, the temp was at 220 but i've subsequently tried 230 and 245 to no avail. in fact, the problem seems to have gotten worse because in the most recent couple of tries the ""print"" of bed_calibration produces almost no extruded material on the bed -- again, this in spite of the fact that i can push the ""extrude"" button in cura and get a nice long thread of white abs without any trouble. any ideas about what i'm doing wrong or what to try in order to get this to work?

fwiw, i notice i have to push pretty hard in order to manually force filament through the extruder. is it supposed to take a lot of force to do this or should it be relatively easy?","since you are getting extrusion when you have the print head lifted off the bed i suspect that the home z height is incorrect (too low).  place a standard piece of paper on the bed at the home position and home the print head.  you should be able to pull the paper out and feel a slight bit of resistance.  if the paper won't move or if the print head creases the paper, raise the z home height.  repeat this process until the paper can be pulled out with slight resistance.

btw: i usually use a hot end temperature of 240c and a bed temperature of 110c when printing abs."
removing parts that are really stuck to the pei bed,"i did searches for this and didn't find anyone mentioning this, so here goes:

i almost never use a tool to get a part up, either with abs or pla.

here's what i do:

i print a skirt around the part, usually about 4 mm away and one layer high.

after the part is printed and the bed has cooled to around 40-50 degrees c, i apply isopropyl alcohol between the part and the skirt, all the way around the part, with an eyedropper.  i apply as much as possible without overflowing outside of the skirt.  the alcohol makes a nice meniscus where it touches the base of the part.  then i wait a bit.

the alcohol seems to pull itself under the part, through surface tension i guess.  for a 4-cm or so circular column, for example, after five minutes or less i can usually simply lift it off of the bed.  if not, a fresh application of alcohol and another similar wait, and up it comes.  no prying, no stress on the pei.

usually the skirt ring comes up easily, after that.  i use the leftover alcohol sitting on the pei by wiping it around with a paper towel to clean the pei, since it's ok to use it for that anyhow.

it works somewhat better for abs, since it doesn't seem to stick as well as pla, but it works well for both.

example:  late last night i had an abs part of about that size firmly stuck onto the bed, and didn't have time to do any of that, so i just left it overnight as it was.  when i got up in the morning it was still firmly stuck, and the bed was now at room temperature.  i applied the alcohol, and within 10 seconds or so i started hearing the cracking sound of the part breaking itself free.  another 10 seconds or so passed, and i lifted the part off of the bed without resistance.  the entire bottom was wetted by the alcohol, it had quickly crept into the space between the bed and the part.

i hope this helps!

-- mike","mikeo.... you sir, are a foot... or a hip. i don't know which one, but you are most certainly a leg end (or something like that).

3dprintdaddy, i can confirm that the ipa approach does indeed work. since getting my pei sheet for my homebrew printer, i had been getting better and better adhesion with abs until i tried printing something with a 200mm diameter base. first two attempts wouldn't stick, so i upped the bed to 120c and the nozzle to 270c. a few hours and a colour change later and i have a good print, stuck fast to the printbed. after the bed cooled down, the part just floated across the surface. next set of prints i do, the parts are not as big, and one of them is stuck so hard to the bed that it snapped as i was trying to dislodge it. i found this post before heading off to work and tried it as soon as i got home. i put some ipa all round the part and in seconds it was completely free.

of course, i was getting so frustrated with it last night with time running low before work that i took a window scraper to it, so now i have to get some very fine grit paper (or equivalent) to clean the bed in places.

now i know what to do next time i may throw away the scraper so i don't make the same mistake again.

mikeo, you have now been officially inducted into the hall of heroes."
lapping pei,hey i am trying to get my print surface really dialed in.  i have run a dial indicator across the thing cold and hot and dialed in the corners to within +- .5 thou.  i know the center of my bed is ~7 thou higher and was wondering if anyone has tried or had any luck lapping their pei.  i searched the forum and the googles and got no hits.,"the apparent hump in the middle is actually not a result of a surface variance in the pei. it's downward rod deflection on the x and y axis rods, but the x axis weighs less so it shows up as an apparent upward bed deflection. that variance is going to change with temperature, with mass on the print bed, etc. you may want to look at the openbuilds extrusion modifications first before worrying about lapping the pei surface, as that may resolve the issue for you. 

if you decide to lap the surface anyways, pei is sandable and somewhat millable. it will tend to be a little brittle, and if you try to use a power method like a dremel on the x carriage, chances are you will loose surface chunks. if you have access to a large honeing stone with a side profile bigger than 12"", you could probably pop the bed off and do it that way, you would have to account for the glass and the adhesive parts, so it would not be easy, 

your starting layer is generally going to be thicker than the variance you are looking at, so any surface variance will generally just be absorbed by the part. if you are having adhesion issues, the aluminum bed mod and the x and y openbuilds mods will resolve that entirely."
sh!tty build quality,"i've just unpacked my new taz5 and i'm a bit disappointed with the overall build quality...

1. the main frame, top to bottom, is about 14mm off the vertical, it's the first thing i noticed when i set on bench - it is visibly out of shape. none of the main struts are bent so this is unlikely to be shipping damage, all the same, it will need straightening out before use.

2. two of the pins on the print head connector were broken, these appear to be the dc feed for the micro-fan adjacent to the print nozzle. i've had to solder in replacement pins and thankfully noted the polarity first because the feeds on the other side of the connector are both orange so there is no intuitive way to check the polarity. it's a bad choice of connector for the purpose; cheap and nasty and totally unsuited to the application, the pins are so weak and any undetected break could seriously damage the print mechanism. i'm looking for an alternative and i'll replace it asap.

3. every cable tie has been over tightened so that they're crushing the actual conduit that's supposed to protect the conductors. i used to joke about sending people on cable tie courses, maybe this isn't funny ant more.

thankfully none of these issues should require replacement parts from lulzbot. all the same, these are unnecessary problems that could be avoided with some better quality control.

st.","did you order yours direct from lulzbot? 14mm deflection on the frame is pretty dang far out, and definitely isn't normal. they use alignment guides and templates during the assembly process, and then print a test piece on that printer before shipping (which you should have received with the printer)  so a variance of that much would be quite noticeable. was it squished over left to right, or front to back?  can you post a picture showing which areas are off? if there is any shipping damage to the box, it's possible the frame torqued out of alignment in a corner drop, but that would have to be one hell of a drop.  you should probably call support and see if they can do something for you to get that resolved. 

the pins are a new connector recent to later model taz 5's. they offer more connection points than the previous clip latch units, but those pins could stand to be a bit bigger. 

the zip tie issue i think is more personal preference."
new taz 5 - extruder feed motor does not rotate,"newbie here and with 3d printing ... (but i am not a newbie to machine tools)

used the quick start guide: assembled new machine, set up home on all axes and leveled platen/print bed using the panel on the machine.

removed the 1.75mm filament used by the factory for printing the test white octopus and replaced with the green 1m long 3mm piece supplied for test printing by user.

installed lulzbot cura and changed cura from 0.35 to 0.5 to match my machine's nozzle; the front panel of the machine already showed that. i then tried to print the octopus. the axes move as expected, but the extruder gears and feed motor bounced back and forth without moving so no extrusion occurred.

i stopped the print, moved the x and y near center and raised z to get to the print head. i removed the filament, and removed the print head from the mount bracket (cable still plugged in) to check that nothing was in the gear teeth. with motor power off, i can rotate the gears and motor.  keeping the print head free in my hand, i powered up and heated the hot end so i could see the extruder motor run by commanding filament feed (i tried both cura and the front panel).  same problem - the motor does not rotate, it just bounces back and forth.

using the the front panel, i see estep and e1step for the extruder are both 800.

note: while trying to look at things with cura shifted to expert, the program offered flashing the taz with 2015q3 firmware version to replace 2015q2 - i did that. i do not recall if that was before, after or straddled with tests on both firmware versions. the above testing was repeated a few times, and the shift to expert might, or might not, have been after first seeing the problem and finding i could rotate the extruder motor.

could not find other topics for this problem posted in this forum. where should i look next?

thank you for any help. i am looking forward to using this very nice machine!","thank you all for your responses.

- set screw and cable are fine. one fuse, f2, supplies all the motors. all motors are running but the extruder motor is not functioning properly; fuse not blown.

- extrusion ""right"" temperature not relevant as long as it is high enough to let the motor run: there is no filament in the machine

- motor just bounces back and forth, so i am contacting support ... tried here first in case someone had seen this before"

nozzle diameter vs actual extrusion diameter,"in another thread we were discussing esteps and how the calibration process  for me yields a number that results in over extrusion.

so last night i manually extruded (in air not on the bed) some abs filament and measured its diameter. my nozzle is marked .35 but the filament extruded measured an average of .47mm after it's cool.

is this normal? or should it be closer to .35mm? perhaps the plastic expands after it leaves the nozzle. but would it expand that much?

perhaps people with .35mm and .5mm can run that test and report their findings?

if my nozzle is mismarked it might explain why my esteps calibration results in over extruded parts?","piercet wrote:additional nozzle length would act as a heat sink eventually, which would stabilize the diameter of the extrusion, but would render it solid and unable to stick to the layers it was being extruded onto, which would kind of make for a somewhat useless 3d printer. that's one of the reasons the variable diameter nozzles haven't really been feasible as of yet,

i was thinking the nozzle would have to have a longer minimum diameter section which remained constant through the heated zone. so it shouldn't effect extruded temperature. it just would require a longer heated zone. as i understood the wikipedia article, the longer the plastic is kept in its elongated shape the less the die swell would be a factor. i don't think it has to cool for the cross section to be more consistent."
hotend won't hold temp w/ fan above 55%,"i am running filkemp (filament express) pla. i quite like it. i extrude at 250c/ & 70mm/s (which sounds hot for pla, but this is a special blend and they reccomend that temp at 70mm/s). i have a .5mm nozzle and am extruding at .61mm.

my issue is that if i run the fan at anything over 55% the hotend starts to cool off - down into the 230s.

is this to be expected? is it possible that this filament is a real 'heatsink' and that the volume i am pusing through at this speed is just too much cooling for the hotend to handle? or, do i have a problem?

thank you!!
j","so - 

i may have solved it.  the tip of my fan shroud was broken off by an inadvertant crash due to some bad gcode.  i think the cooling fan was blowing air too high up on the hotend. i printed a new shroud.

belt drive extruder,"hey i saw this new extruder design a little while ago but cant find it anymore and was wondering if anyone knew anything about it.  now i am not referring to what you find when you type belt drive extruder into google.  i do not mean that it uses a belt to turn the hobbed bolt, i am referring to one without a hobbed bolt and used a belt to press against the pulley inside the extruder.  

anyone know what i am talking about or anything more about it?  good/bad?  link to more info on it?","yeah, the vaeder is most likely the one he is referring to. the other similar one is the librostruder, which doesn't actually use a belt but uses the same general feed principle."
building a flexistruder v2,i am going to need a flexistruder v2 for my taz 5 pretty soon and lulzbot is out of stock. i don't think it would be hard to build one. however i have been searching the forum and devel.lulzbot.com for hours and can't figure out exactly what all i will need. i am not new to making things just looking for some sort of guide to help me along the way. any suggestions or help is greatly appreciated!,"steps to build a flexystruder v2:
1. source a hexagon hotend with a 0.60mm nozzle. e3d v6 nozzles are compatable with the hexagon, and makergeeks has a good selection, make sure you get a 3mm bore nozzle and not a 1.75mm one. 
2. source a length of ptfe tube from mcmaster carr (part numbers are in the flexystruder bom under download.lulzbot.com) order the following drill bits at the same time:
3.5mm drillbit
6.5mm drillbit
8mm drillbit
3.source the mechanicals (motor, hobbed bolt, wade gears, fans, etc. 
4. print an extruder mount carriage
5. print the flexystruder body and any of the gears
drill the filliament hole out from the top with the 6.5mm drillbit and insert the ptfe tube. cut it flush with the top of the flexystruder and the top of the hexagon hotend insert hole on the bottom. 
6. drill all the way down the ptfe tube with the 3.5mm drill bit, to make the hole large enough for fillament
7. drill down the center hobbed bolt hole with the 8mm drill bit to remove a section of the ptfe tube so the hobbed bolt can actually grab the fillament. 
8. assemble everything, then go print something. 

assembly guide for the v1: 
https://ohai.lulzbot.com/project/flexystruder_assembly/
this is identical except the v2 doesn't have the heat set insert and adjustment lug on the side, and the v2 has the hexagon mount on the bottom.

"severe issues with pla and petg, + questions","i had sever issues with pla, went back to abs, and nozzle broke.  replaced nozzle by preheating the extruder, printed a lot with abs, worked great aside from some pretty significant warp, which was expected, and a few lousy layers slightly off in the x and y, which happened to before and is expected because i haven't gotten what i would consider an excellent print.  switched to petg, had some stingy prints (what its known for) but then the print failed after about 15 layers of the print because the filament jammed (same issue i had with pla.)  another print, much better, but made it to only an inch, part had a lower infil.  all pats have had some shaky exteriors even at low speeds (50mm) meaning some layers aren't perfectly on top of each other.  also, having done some machinery, and having done the paper trick for zeroing mills i know it works but it drives me nuts.  i would like to first level the bed with a dial indicator then use a feeler gauge for the extruder.  side note i have an 18 dollar ceramic heater in a closet on high during all prints (printer is in the closet) also where i store the filament.  not a true enclosure, but it's also probably 88-95 degrees in there.

what settings are you all using for petg?
how do i stop the jamming?  i was at 255deg and 100 bed temp, and i cleaned the knurled thing, and the tensioner is at 5mm.
is it worth it to stop using cura and start using slicer?
what is the firm height number the z is supposed to be off the bed?
has anyone hit the bed with an ir or laser thermometer or flir to see where the hot/cool spots are?
what's the best chemical to use to clean the bed?  alcohol or acetone?
i read about calibrating z-step, is there a guide on that?  or a guide for adjusting any of the other preset factory settings to try and get this thing purring?","mrarmyant wrote:

i don't use petg (primarily abs), but i'll try to fill in some of the answers to your questions:
-  you're on the right track with the dial gauges and feelers.  quantifying the nozzle / bed height takes a lot of the guess work out of leveling the bed.  i'd suggest simultaneously using two dial gauges on either side of the toolhead... with just one you'll be chasing each corner a number of times since adjusting one affects at least the other corner if not all three.

- from my experience, cura is superior to slic3r.  i struggled through slic3r before buying simplify3d for my prior printer.  it was night and day.  so i continued with s3d exclusively for the taz.  my honest opinion is that i believe cura can be tweaked to as good or better than s3d.
- the ""firm height the z is supposed to be off the bed"" is 18.5mm for my printer.  i'm guessing it will vary depending on the printed x-carrier and printed toolhead variations.  best to find your own, using the feelers... i use a business card which measures .35mm
-  yes, a member has taken some thermal images of the bed in comparison of the glass to aluminum. i think the thread is here:
viewtopic.php?f=7&t=2615&p=15602&hilit= ... era#p15602
- consensus isn't out on whether ipa or acetone is good for the pei.  i use both sparingly, but ipa more so than acetone... forum members report that the chemicals don't affect the pei, but lb has some posts (could be deprecated) warning against the use.
- calibration of the extruders can be found here... specifically you're looking for the step to calculate e-steps:
https://ohai.lulzbot.com/group/calibration/
the basic process is to put a mark on the filament, then manaully extrude 10mm, measure how far the mark advanced.  if its not amount you requested, use the formula to calculate the proper e-steps.  use the lcd to store the new setting.

as for the jamming... 
- don't overtighten the idler.  the hobbed bolt doesn't need to dig into the filament.  it should leave some marks to indicate that there's enough pressure from the idler, but they should be superficial and not really deep.  teeth marks can possibly get caught in the transition from extruder, hotend plate and hotend... if things are misaligned.
- check the recommended extursion temps for the petg, go a little hot with the hotend to ensure the heat is keeping up with the filament.  this introduces other things like ooze which you may need to tweak retraction settings.  
- if you've had your taz for a while, you may want to check the extruder to hotend alignment... over time the screws may loosen and cause a 1-2 mm misaligment which could increase friction in the filament path.  
- also check that the heatsink blower is functioning, make sure its blowing on the heasink.  i like to pivot mine .5 - 1mm down so that it hits the heatsink end block(not the heater block).  this will ensure the areas of the heatsink are kept cool to best mitigate any heat creep issues."
corner glob,"hey,
i recently setup my taz5 and am trying to get it really dialed in.  i have noticed that there is a small glob where the extruder turns around when it reaches the perimeter.  it seems to leave a little more plastic there than necessary.  i was wondering if anyone knew of a setting to change or some way of reducing this.  i am using mattercontrol, hatchbox pla, and a .5mm nozzle.  i have tried printing at several different extruder temps and have not seen any different results so i dont think it is a temperature problem.  i have attached a picture to help describe the problem.","if it's not over extruding, then it's the unavoidable problem due to nozzle pressure. for the turn around, the nozzle has to decelerate, stop, and accelerate again. the pressure inside the nozzle is a little bit behind this actions, there is a delay. it's like it's still extruding during the short stop.
you can minimize the effect by printing realy slow, turn down the acceleration values or increase the jerk value. but all those things have side effects of course.
a real fix can only be done inside the firmware, with some kind of an advanced pressure regulation calculation. at the moment, this is not done in marlin."
taz 5: click noises on z axis,"hello! i´ve recently purchased a taz 5 and for a month everything was perfect.
but suddenly i´m getting this weird ""click"" noises when i move the z axis (both up and down, but the noises are slightly different).

i attach 2 videos of each one, hoping that someone recognize them and give me any clue about this.
i´m afraid i will have to unmount some pieces of the printer, but first it would be great to know what is happening (and why, in order to avoid it in the future).

so, here we go. the first one is the noise i hear when the z axis is going up:

some questions before purchasing a taz5.,"hi all,

i am a 3d printing beginner and my research so far has landed me in the taz5 camp. from all the reviews that i've read the taz5 seems to be the best overall printer with the best balance of quality, flexibility, and price. however, i do have some questions for which i have not been able to find answers. i was hoping that the users of this board could help me!

in an tom's hardware review of the taz5 (ucp.php?mode=activate&u=2830&k=1ibpfo), i read that a newer version of the taz5 is coming up, which will include the auto bed leveling and the nozzle scrubbing pad. does anyone know when that is going to become available?

related to the above, do you know whether the newer taz5 (with auto leveling) will also include the manually-adjustable bed screws? auto-leveling is nice but i've read that it's done in-software. i would think that the software auto-leveling would be great to compensate for heat expansion but nothing beats a physically leveled bed.

finally, i see on the lulzbot website that a 0.35mm nozzle is available for the taz5 but only as a separate purchase. does anyone know why i can't order the taz5 with the 0.35mm nozzle directly?

thank you all for the help!","voidtrance wrote:
which one would you think is better? auto leveling or manual? i've read that software leveling has it's limitations and nothing is better than truly level printing surface so i don't mind doing it manually if that is the better way to go. on the other hand compensating for heat expansion is nice too.

related question: does the auto leveling happen before or after the bed is heated up?


on my particular taz, i have modified it somewhat, one of the mofications being replacing the stock endstop target with a micrometer barrel. with that mod. i never really have to re-level. in my case, waiting for an auto leveling system each time would not necessarily be a good use of my time. for a different user with less leveling experiance and a printer more prone to needing leveling, it might be a highly desireable feature. i only level my bed at full temperature and full nozzle expansion. 

the auto leveling happens at the beginning of when you press the print button. if the printer is at full temp when you hit that button, it will be heated up. if it isn't all the way to temperature and you still hit print, it will be at whatever temperature it reached when you pressed the button, still rising towards the full setpoint. 
voidtrance wrote:
thanks for the suggestion! do you mind pointing me in the direction of the problems users were reporting? i completely realize that smaller print nozzle would resulting in higher print times and i am prepared to deal with that to get higher quality prints. however, i'd like to read up on the other issues users were dealing with before i decide.

thank you.
if you do a search in the forum for ""taz nozzle clogging"" from about a year and a half ago you will see some of them. there were a few people that complained about more frequint ""clogging"" in reality they were probably too close to the bed, or printing abs and lifting off the bed and blocking the nozzle, because it is easier to block a smaller hole than a bigger one. there were a few minor quality controill issues with the first 0.35mm nozzles where some brass shavings were found in the nozzle, having broken off sometime after shipping, but i know of only two instances of that, and one of them was a user who was also having a bunch of other problems related to ""clogging"" debris based clogging of nozzles almost never happens. almost every instance that gets reported is actually caused by the nozzle ending up too close to somethign and eventually jamming (the bed, the part, etc.) those have almost all ceased to be reported with the move to the 0.5mm nozzle. 

one thing to be aware of, the only resolution advantage a 0.35mm nozzle gives you over a 0.5mm is in printing 0.35mm features on a print, for example a 0.35mm wide window molding on an archatextural model. a 0.50mm nozzle can print just as thin a layer as a 0.35mm nozzle, so the only advantage is on small features in the outer perimiter. most people don't print thin layers with them for some reason, but there isn't a huge amount of things that a 0.35mm nozle will do that a 0.50mm one won't do. 

do a search for ""issues"" or ""problems"" in here, and you will see any issues, and most of the time solutions for anything along those lines. 

you're welcome again!"
auto home problem,"i am able to drive the z axis up and down with the lcd controller without issue. no binding, grinding, or funny noises of any kind. when i hit auto home the z axis will freeze at whatever its current location happens to be and i hear a humming noise. ( sounds like its coming from the stepper motor but can't be sure ) i've been having this problem sporadically since receiving my printer about a month ago ( usually when starting a print because it homes before each print ) but i've always been able to cure it by simply turning the printer off and back on again. no such luck today. cycled power on the printer and power supply, both to no avail. anybody had this issue before? any ideas?","following up on this. i finally got a chance to call in to support this morning. they did an awesome job! had me up and going again in a matter of minutes. the issue turned out to be with the control box. the chip driving the z axis can start to have heat issues because of the draw from the two stepper motors it drives. in short, it gets hot and then your z axis stepper motors get out of sync.

here is what they had me do: 
1. using the ruler in the tool kit, measure vertically from the aluminum plate of the heat bed to the smooth guide rod of the x axis. mine was off by a couple of centimeters.
2. disable stepper motors and drive the high side down to level by turning the lead screw with your hand.
3. go to configuration/advanced settinngs/vmax z. mine was set to 8 i changed it to 3. this slows down the movement of your z axis.
4. exit menu and save settings.
5. auto home

at this point everything resumed normal functionality. i was told there are a few more things to try if the issue arises again and to not hesitate to call back.

had to go to work so i haven't been able to re-level and run any test prints, but i did run the z axis up and auto home numerous times without issue. hopefully this is helpful for someone else in the future that encounters this problem."
printing a plen2 (how to make parts fit),"hi! i´m trying to print a plen2 robot chasis, using a normal esun silver pla filament.
i managed to get some parts ""correctly"" printed (no perfect), but i´m having a nightmare with 70% of the rest. 






i´m still not a pro with my taz5, and even worse there is practically no updated documentation about this robot or is poor.
here are some thoughts until now (5 days printing low-quality parts).

fitting parts: not even once
there are this small gears (about 1cm) that must fit an area of exactly the same size. there is no gap at all. 1cm piece for a 1cm hole. 
http://plen.jp/playground/wiki/_media/s ... cement.png
http://plen.jp/playground/wiki/_media/s ... cement.png

- i first tried lowering the external shell width (from 1mm to 0.5, having a 0.5 nozzle). this made some improvements, but still i had to ""operate"" with cutting and sanding tools to make things fit. i suposse that setting the shell to 0mm is not an option, right..?
- i noticed that the first layer was too wide, making some parts hard to fit, so i tried lowering the default bottom/top thickness from 1mm to 0.25, but pieces were not well fixed to the bed this way, so i returned to 1mm.
- after a long research (and following valuable advices in a previous post) i was 99% sure that this was a case of e-steps settings. so i dug into it and tried to measure the length of a 5cm extrusion step (with quite primitive tools...) and i didn´t see any noticeable gap. also, many people asures that the default factory settings for the taz5 are quite accurate. so could e-steppers really be a problem in this fitting pieces case? or i´m looking on the wrong direction? anyway i will try to make a more exhaustive measure on this to make it sure.
- when support material is required, this holes where the other part should fit are always filled with garbage very difficult to remove, making fits even harder.

my pieces are not solid enough
well, this is evident: i broke 90% of all the small tabs that should have made a secured ""click"" when trying to fit them together.
i read that small parts should never be 100% solid, i was using a simple 10-20%. but it seems that this (even being a very slow value itself) is not applied proportionally to the size of the piece itself: 20% is the same separation between infill walls when printing a 3cm figure than when printing a 30cm one, is this concept right? could a 80% be right in this case? 










i officially hate to use support material
seriously, i´m angry with myself for still not mastering this important setting. i always have a lot of problems to print some pieces when they need support. i´m now using a custom setting in my last tests (x/y distance 1mm, z distance 0.15), but it seems i´m going backwards... my hand is literally destroyed for spending so much time removing this hard-as-rock support material. i´m getting something wrong and i need help with this, no doubt. 

(in the previous picture you can also see that i couldn´t remove all the support material, impossible)





also, if a layer has to be printed ""on the air"" using support material, the final result is not smooth at all.





curved parts have bad resolution
this is really weird. when a part starts drawing a curved structure from the bottom, every single piece i printed showed this problem. if the curve is somewhere at the top, it is perfectly printed. as a clue, i noticed that when looking this first layers being printed, they seem to slightly elevate itselfs upwards, maybe because the hot of the bed being so close or the layers so thin? (0.15mm height). when the nozzle came to that areas, the pression of the extrusion would push the layers to its proper position, and with consecutive layers, the weight itself slowly makes the problem to dissappear, but that first layers... awful!  could this be also a fan-related setting issue? 

(you can also notice it on the previous picture, the first layers of the head part)






sorry for posting so much comments at once, feel free to add your opinions/thoughts to any of them.","to make parts fit better, try decreasing the flow rate by a few percent... give 95 - 97% a shot.  i'm actually down to 90% on my prints, but i've also increased the overlap in my solid infill layers (top / bottom layers)

you definitely want infill to help with strength... especially if you've decreased the shell thickness.  you don't need 100%, but 50% would be good for a part that.  i think of infill in volume of that layer.  so an infill of 100% would print every adjacent pass in that layer, a 50% infill would print every other adjacent pass.  therefore the overall part would be 50% solid.

for my projects, i try to stick with a shell of 1.5mm.  maintaining the thickness will depend on your extrusion width and layer height.  the shell works together with the infill to create strength in a project.

supports... they can be a pain, but are necessary for accurate parts.  i use simplify3d as my slicer which allows for manual placement of supports.  its rumored that s3d supports are easier to remove... they are, but the trick is to get the proper horizontal and vertical separation.  in cura, look for xy and z distances under expert settings -> supports.  the xy distance looks good at .7, but i'd optimize as a multiple of your extrusion width.  the z needs to be increased from .05 to .5 or .7, again optimize to be a multiple of your layer height...  

the curve resolution is something i haven't figured out completely... i've increased the overlap to help with this be.  if there's a setting for inside out printing, that's what you want.  versus outside perimeter to inside printing.  the other nice thing about s3d, is the ability to generate a higher density raft at the top of the supports before the actual object.  this allows the creation of a platform for printing of overhangs, but it doesn't seem possible in cura.

sorry for the book... hope some of it helps."
new taz 5 - issues with taller prints - consistent height ribbing / waviness (solved),"hi all,

i am a new taz 5 owner (previously owned a robo 3d r1) and am working through some initial issues but one issue i cannot seem to figure out is z ribbing / waviness on taller prints - this seems to occur at fairly consistent intervals or layers once i start to get higher than 5-6 inches. 

everything is stock on the machine, i am using cura with the lulzbot hips filament and lulzbot hips medium quality print profile.

layer height - 0.25
shell thickness - 1.0
print speed - 50 mm / s
bottom/top thickness - 0.8
nozzle - 240 c
bed - 110 c
nozzle size - 0.5











as you can see on the attached pictures the quality toward the bottom of the parts are great but then start to really worsen. the fact that it happens at these intervals is what is curious. these 2 posts were printed side by side, with 1 of the 2 having significantly worse ribbing / waviness. the table that the printer sits on has a slight wobble but i didn't think the consistent layer issue would to contributed to the table, am i wrong in assuming that?

i have also attached the stl and gcode but like i said its not just happening with this one model, it tends to happen with everything i have tried that exceeds that 5-6 inch height threshold.

i have spent some time searching the forums and i am not sure if i have seen this or am not searching for the right criteria, so i apologize if this is covered elsewhere.

any insight is much appreciated!","there is definitely something weird going on, but that actually doesn't look like z wobble. with z wobble, you have an offset that is fairly constant up the entire part, that roughly matches the spacing of the threads on your leadscrews if you hold the part up next to it. in this case, you are having some offset issues, but only in occasional places, not regularly and matching the leadscrew threads, which means something else is probably going on here. it looks more like you might have a slightly loose setscrew or slightly loose belt in either the x or y direction, that is allowing either the bed to shift or the x carriage to shift. i suspect it's on the y side since it is only showing up when the  bed has sufficient additional mass on it, it could also be frame misalignment, a bearing that is gummed up and needs cleaning, fuzz in the bearing, etc. also check the z motor couplings and the z motors themselves for loose screws check those things and see if that improves things any.  if not, let us know and we'll look at other things."
uhhhgg -   couple issues that were not here before,"ok,  i have not had to print anything in a little while - i appreciate all the help on my last post with larger abs prints.  calibrations, turning the fan off, and hot boxing it have helped.  though my temp hotbox solution has been moving the taz into a small bathroom and closing the door.  now i don't have to listen to it either.  so its a start.

i just started printing a bunch of stuff again and am noticing that the starts and stops of my outer shell of prints are either over or under extruding maybe?  this is happening on abs and pla.  

see picture.

i am also noticing that when the bed moves to a certain point on the outer edge of y movement it starts to vibrate or flutter - i can see the resulting vibes on the printed parts in that area too.  maybe there is something wrong with the belt or bearings in this area.     but this is not happening in the area of my stops and starts where the picture is taken.  

i think there maybe something up with my change in direction possibly having a little backlash.  but i'll need to run a test part to see.

piercet - i am going to eventually do the rail conversions - being a machinist - this is really frustrating that after spending $2k   this thing still needs to be modified for the simplest of things, deflection, crappy bearings with slop in them etc.   sigghhh.","the vibration in y picture looks exactly like the ""vibration due to bearing contact looseness or debris in the bearings or overtight belt issue. ""  what happens is the bed or the nozzle moves along and basically something causes it to change its motion plane slightly, and then it oscillates to recover. it can be the bed itself that is causing it, or it could be the x axis moving forward or backwards in the y axis direction. a loose nozzle mount or loose x carriage bearings can cause that as well, but usually you will see oddness in the x axis as well. 

the other picture is more difficult to see what is going on. both x and y are in play in the place it is having issues, as well as an overhang, and the whole thing is sitting on a support layer. it could just be the support layer was rough enough it created a persistant bobble, but you would expect that to work its way out after a few layers. it could be mechanical, it could also be the model itself has a flaw at that location. can you post the stl file for that? 

either way, it does have the same harmonic pattern going around the curve. it's interesting that the pattern is there on the outside curve, but less visible on any of the inside ones. is it present on the other side of the part as well, or just that side? if it's just on that one side, that may indicate which side of the printer a mechanical issue could be present at. 

with the printer off, check the y bed and the x carriage for movement up and down or side to side. if it can move at all, undo the screws holding the bearings and move the bearings out further until the movement stops."
horizontal banding... bad!!!,"so i know there have been some threads on this, but its been a while since ive seen someone really try to address the issue.

back story.  this is my third taz.  the first was returned for nozzle issues, and heating block concerns.
the second had a bent lead screw causing largely the same issues.

this one has never given great prints, but i guess i kind of accepted that it wouldnt.  its just gotten to the point where its really affecting things.

so here is a picture 


this printer has less than 50 hours on it, and its already doing this.
im not printing fast, maybe 50mm/s, this is pla in the picture, which is obviously a pretty easy filament.  its well dialed in from a first layer, etc persepctive, thats not a concern.  dimensionally the parts are good as well, very accurate, its just they look like crap for lack of a better term.
its time to get this thing working better or get rid of it to be quite honest. 

is there some things i can try?  i know i dont want to remove the bearings, as thats not really an intended thing.  if a lead screw it bent that would be yet again the millionth one of those 

thanks","the anti z wobble part and the new drylin bearings would probably eliminat emost of the wobble for the least expense. the x and y openbuilds project would also resolve things and improve some other quality aspects, but the part cost is pretty high. the openbuilds z axis tends to help some, but if you do the x and y mod first, it has less impact.

you may also want to consider printing the strengthened extruder mount and discojohn's reinforced hexagon extruder body, which looks kind of goofy but fixes the forward and back y axis flex http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1149597 

in your particular machines case, either something is already very much out of allignment, or you have a bent leadscrew. to start, you might try loosening the right side z motor and attempting a test print. if that doesn't help, lock it back down and loosen the right z nut. if that fixes the issue, the leadscrew may be out of parallel, or possibly bent. also try loosening the z bearing block and the x end plate. try them all one at a time, on both sides. whichever ends up improving the wobble is probably the source of the issue. if you find it is only on one side, check that leadscrew for straightness. also check the measurements from leadscrew to leadscrew at the top and the bottom, they should be identical. 

you may also try resetting the z axis couplers. if one side is off significantly on angle, or if it is up too high or low and the couple spring section is up above the center of where the motor shaft and the leadscrew shaft meet, that can cause a similar issue. check all of those things first, then attempt the modifications to improve."
what is going on with my prints?!,"ok, so i am seeing this with both pla and abs. the blue is pla and the grey is abs.

also check your filliament diameter setting. curia defaults to either 3.00mm or 2.85mm, but filliament can often be smaller or larger than that, and if it is off you end up over or underextruding. 

other things that are critical are bed level and good adhesion, temperatures of nozzle and bed, and when to use or not use a fan. no fan for abs except for bridging or small layers, for pla fan is a requirement. abs temperature, start with 240c on the nozzle and 105 on the bed. you want a .40mm to .45mm thick starting layer, if you are too close to the bed you will over extrude.

sanding pei,"because i can't get abs to stick on stock taz 5 bed. (pla is fine though)

alright so i've read through a bunch of the stuff on the forums and far as i can tell the only thing left to try is sanding the bed.

clean bed religiously with isopropyl alcohol?
verified 110c bed 240 hotend?
cardboard enclousure?
z axis? smush? measured plus the bottom of prints are near flawlessly smooth?
first layer set to 200%?

so i've read suggestions of anywhere between 500 grit and 5000 grit. i have 1000 grit. any reason i shouldn't use that? the thought of sanding the bed makes me uncomfortable so i just wanted to get some affirmation from those more experience than i before i fully commit.

secondary question, does anyone use acetone/abs slurry on pei? from what i understand ideally, it shouldn't be necessary, but just curious if there is a reason to actively avoid using it? what about glue sticks?","tylerdanger wrote:piercet are you saying there is always the option to buy an aluminum bed and replace the glass/pei stock bed?
if i sand it i def want to be as conservative as possible. just enough to slightly rough up the surface. i'll probably just avoid acetone then. piercet what do you use when printing abs?

yup, well, make one anyways. you need a 3/16"" thick 12"" x 12"" plate (sourced from ebay), 4 modified bed corner pieces (sourced from thingiverse http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1098784) a new heating element (lulzbot sells them when they are in stock or you can peel the existing one of the glass) and a new pei sheet with adhesive or a buildtak sheet. you put the pei on top of the aluminum, stick the bed heater on the bottom, print the new corner pieces out with heat set inserts (m3, from mcmaster carr) and put it back in place and re-level. the huge advantage the aluminum sheet gives you is even and constant heat across the entire build platform surface. the glass tends to have a hot spot in the middle and colder edges. the aluminum bed plate mod, coupled with the x and or y axis openbuilds extrusions, make for very well adhering prints."
abs sticks to plate like insanity! help.,i have noticed my last few prints have been close to impossible to remove from the plate of my taz 5. they were smaller items so i broke them. very frustrating. how do you guys deal with this?,"the root cause of the abs sticking to the pei too well is the nozzle height is too close to the bed.

give the z-endstop a quarter turn ccw.  

alternatively, use the z-offset gcode setting in your slicer to raise the nozzle after homing... use .15 to .3mm.  if you need to increase past .3, then adjust your z-endstop.  on the flip side, a negative z-offset value will lower the nozzle further and increase adhesion... not what you want in your case.  "
rear right of bed won't lower anymore..still smacks extruder head..what do i do?,"after pulling off a very sticky abs print i am finding my bed not level. i also found my x axis bars not level with the metal bed. so i measured the bars distance from the metal bed and moved the stepper motors to level it with the bed. i still cannot home the right rear of the bed z axis because the head hits the bed and the bed won't lower anymore. i cannot get a piece of paper under it because it is pressing against the bed. the screws are at there lowest point in the right rear. 

do you guys have any suggestions?

thanks in advance","what version of the taz do you have? specifically is it a taz 3 or before? the bed mounts on the taz 3 would allow lifting of the y axis frame. i would check that first. if it isn't that, something is out of allignment but good and you are going to have to do a basic level reset to get back in the ballpark. 

depending on which printer you have, this process will be a little different, but i'm going to assume you have a taz 4  or 5. 

step 1. with the nozzle up away from the bed a few mm, use your verneir calipers to measure between the top of the bottom leadscrew bearing, to the bottom of the leadscrew nut on both sides of the printer. that distance should be identical. if it isn't identical, power off the printer, disconnect the motor to prevent electrical pulse into the controller board, then manually turn one leadscrew until both sides are identical. then reconnect and power the printer back on. you may also want to measure from the top of that same bearing, down to the lowest part of the frame and make sure both sides are identical. they should be from the factory, but i have heard of at least one that slipped. 

step 2. with your x carriage level to the z motor mounts, check your bed against the nozzle by using a feeler gauge. if one corner is still significantly off, you will also need to reset the screws. find which screw is down in the bed mount furthest, and then back it off until the bottom of the screw is just flush with the underside of the bed mount plate. now turn it in 15 more turns. use this as your starting height, and adjust the bed level height to that point. now move the nozzle to each of the 4 corners, and adjust those screws to match.

step 3. run the bedcalibration gcode file that came on your sd card multiple times, making minor adjustments as needed, until you get a good contact pattern all around, the lines all look parallel and symmetrical, and things are just squished down enough.

if you do all that and its still off, it's possible you bent something important."
exstruder seems to time out,"hi all, 


   hey i am trying to print a box: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:408189. how ever it seems into the second hour of print my extruder stops extruding. the too head continues to move as if it were printing. i get the same results in cura, matter control, and simplify 3d. i don't think there is a blockage because when i restart the print it begins as normal extruding perfectly. anyone have any ideas what could cause this. this is the first print that i have done that takes longer than 3hours.","which part of the box are you trying to print?  you may want to run the stl(s) through netfabb or ms's online repair tool to validate that there are no issues with the model... looking at the box in s3d, it detected some self-intersecting faces... which i think is pretty minor, but could affect the print.

as for the heat creep, the basic problem is that the filament gets too hot in the hotend chamber and swells or melts too early.  thus the filament gets ""clogged"" or ""stuck"".  the additional heat seems fine for abs, but pla is affected more since it has a lower temperature range to become liquefied.  the solution is to provide more cooling to the heatsink.  the forum community users have come up with conversions and mods to better cool the heatsink.  most involve replacing the small blower with a 30x30 box fan utilizing the same wiring.  here's one that seems like a quick drop-in:

24v heat bed,"i want to upgrade my taz2 to a taz3 at least.. the biggest thing i remember was going from a 12v to 24v heat bed + psu.

the 24v heat bed is not in stock on the store, i emailed support, who have never bothered to email back (support@lulzbot.com) (thats some awesome customer support right there), trying to find out when/if it would be back in stock.. nada.

anyone know of any other compatible 24v heat beds of the same size i could use?","the threaded rod setup is different, but i think it still uses the same rods. don't go with the taz 3 bed mounts, print the taz 5 ones, they don't have the lifting issue and will fit fine. the taz 5 x carriage is also going to be a drop in replacement with some additional nice features. the x end springs went through a bunch of revisions.ideally you want to order a set of the x end plates from either itw if they get them back in stock, or techsavvy34 here in the forums, then pick up a pair of the leadscrews and leadscrew nuts (do a search for mitsumi in the forums for the exact part numbers) and go straight to taz 4 or 5 spec. the jump from 3 to for is a huge quality upgrade, and requires reprinting the same amount of parts. assuming you have to buy them all new, thats around $120 + plastic for a much better printing printer

edit: also, check your power supply. the taz 1 was the 12 volt version, the taz 2 should be 24 volt already."
does the taz have any over heating safety measures?,"i was curious about the safety of the taz for doing prints while you step away. many of the consumer 3d printers today are made my smaller companies (compared to ge etc) and probably don't have the r&d funds to do rigorous testing. a lot of these are hobbiest type equipment not factory grade etc. that being said, what do you guys do for prints that will last way too long for you to sit and watch it? 

how safe do you feel these printers are? like all of you i do live in a wood based home

and yes, there are controls in octoprint for the movement and temperature settings. in some ways, they aren't as nice as cura/simplify3d, but they get the job done.

  well my plan is to use simplify 3d for the slicer and save the gcode to a sd.  so i am assuming the octoprint runs on the sbpi and the screen you have connected to it, allows you to control the machine interface. i'm sure i have missed something but trying to juggle a few projects around to get the time for this.  thanks again for the postings.

i don't have a screen connected to the pi. it's possible to do, but i have my smartphone with me most of the time and can control it over the network that way. i also have computers in the room. 

so my workflow is to slice and save the gcode on the computer using simplify3d, or cura. i have a browser open to the octoprint page. bring that up, then the file browser already open to the gcode directory. drag the gcode to the left side of the webpage and it automatically uploads to octoprint which saves it on the sd card that's already in the pi. then click print and it goes. 

if you drop the file on the right side, it will save to the printer's sd card. at least that's what it says, my mini doesn't have a slot so i don't know. but since i have octoprint running already, i figure it doesn't hurt anything to let it feed the gcode to the printer. 

it also has the webcam feed which is handy for checking on the print in progress. i use the camera module the pi people make and a printed mount. i added some led lighting so i can turn the room lights off and still see the image. that same page has controls for the x/y/z steppers and extruder. the temperature gets its own tab."
internal blower setup for taz 4 to taz 5 upgrade,"first, i want to say ""thank you"" for those who compiled the information on the taz 4/taz 5 upgrade that i was able to find.

now to the point: after purchasing the internal blower wires, external blower wires, version 2c single extruder (the hexagon one) with intentions of upgrading my extruder/hotend from taz 4 to taz 5, i am left with an unaddressed issue. 

where can i find information on where to plug in the external* blower wire socket to the rambo board inside the control box, and to which pins of the circular socket plugs do i run the external/internal* blower through? 

the steps i have taken so far are rerouting the wires for the internal blower through the black cable buncher but do not know which pins of the 14-pin circular plug to connect the internal* blower to.

octopi hardware,"hi folks,

i've just set up a raspberry pi with octopi to control my new taz 5, and now i'm looking to put it into a case attached to the machine somehow, with a camera for monitoring progress.

i've seen scuttlebot's lcd case mod here: viewtopic.php?f=36&t=3097 but i'm wondering if there are other ideas for attaching separate enclosure with a camera to the frame, and what camera suggestions people have. the other cases i saw on thingiverse appeared to be freestanding boxes, but i may have missed something.

i'm also wondering, for mounting anything, will i need to remove the structural supports from the frame? and will that make it so that i may get the unit's shape out of true?

also, i got the raspberry pi camera board, but i'm wondering if a usb webcam may be a better option for easy positioning and attaching the camera to the frame, given the short wide ribbon on the pi camera.

anyway, any suggestions are welcome!","there is a case that replaces the stock taz control box lid with an octoprint raspberry pi bump out enclosure, and a few others along that line. i'd reccommend taking a look at the ones in the mod list thread for ideas. viewtopic.php?f=36&t=2378"
do you still use abs juice with heated taz 5 bed?,"i am noticing my first layer of my prints isn't sticking well. using presets for temp and level bed. 

do you guys still use this or should i do something else to get better sticking?

thanks...

chris","a pva glue stick (like elmer's) is required for flexible filament and nylon.  but not as a sticking agent, more as a sacrificial surface for those plastics.  without the pva, they tend to stick too well to the pei sheet.  i also use the pva stick with hips as a sticking agent.

i have used abs ""juice"" on the pei; however, i have since determined that my problem was a combination of too much hand oil and incorrect z home position (not close enough to the bed).

the only time i have had issues with acetone on the pei surface is when i have applied the acetone while the bed was still warm.  the cooling caused by the rapid evaporation of the acetone tends to ""craze"" the pei surface which results in premature failure of the pei sheet."
left z motor not working,"the left z-stepper motor (near the electronics box) on my taz 5 is no longer functioning. the right one is working fine. as far as i can tell everything is still connected and there is no damage. the frame is aligned as well.

starting out poor,i am an educator in montana.  we purchased a taz 5 just before christmas break.  we tried doing several prints on it with only one success.  it doesn't want to stick to the table very well.  the edges seem to curl up and then it comes off.  i'm sure it is something we are setting correct.  we are using rbs filament.,"i actually started out printing abs. i feel it's a more rewarding material to work with once you figure out the learning curve. and you don't have to go through all the pla melty fan wierdness. with abs on a taz 5, you need a very level bed, you need the correct temperature, and you need the correct starting layer thickness. you also need to make sure the cooling fan is off (not the one that cools the hexagon hotend that is supposed to be always on, but the other ""cool the part"" fan) 

to start, run the bed calibration gcode file from the sd card or online repeatedly. adjusting the bed as needed, until you get a perfect print pattern. if you find you are off quite a bit to start, use a thin metal feeler gauge (a thin metal ruler works well), heat the printer up to full operating temperature (start with 240c for the nozzle and 100-105c for the bed) since the print nozzle itself expands in length as it heats to a certain point, then move the nozzle to each corner and adjust the corner screws until the nozzle is the same distance from each corner. if you have to make any major adjustments, you may be off one notch on your leadscrews, or the frame may have a cable pinched betweeh the x frame and the bed frame. 

next, run the bed calibration file again and adjust the height. you want it to just start to sqush to the bed. not mashed to it like a smear of paste. that makes the initial layer too thin, and it will lift and pull away. you actually want the first layer to be about .40mm to .45mm thick. if you find it is still pulling away at one corner or one side, you don't have the bed level yet. 

it should take some effort to peel the bed calibration pattern print off the bed. if it comes away too easily, you probably need to be closer to the bed. 

hope that helps!"
taz 5 large print stopping mid-print - twice!,"have had my taz 5 for a couple weeks now and getting to know it.  yesterday was my third attempt at printing the engine block for the toyota 22re engine.  cura says about 30 hours to complete.  during my last two attempts, the print just stopped at exactly the same location, layer, etc...

apologies if it's a dupe: conversion to 1.7mm?,"my apoloigies for what is i am sure an duplicate question. funny thing is - the forum won't let me search for ""upgrade filament 1.7mm"" because they are all ""commonly used words"" and i cannot use them in my search. so i have no easy way to find the answer it seems. googling gives a reference sheet from adafruit on converting the taz 4 but i'm not sure how similar the extruders are and if thats possible. the taz modifications thread has a link to a 1.75mm toolhead, but it just goes to an undocumented file directory full of stuff, none of which seems to be a guide or usable parts. i'm looking at the 1.7 e3d head and all that comes with, however, if its possible with the current hot end (even if it's not ideal) i'd like to give it a shot.

before the ""why would you want to"" questions (i've read a lot about how 3mm is better in many ways for the taz 5) - i'm an old makerbot version 1.wooden-unstable-piece-of-crap-hate-it-time-to-get-a-working-printer-hey-lulzbot-looks-awesome owner. with an absolute ton of 1.7mm filament i'd hate to have to toss (or go through the hassle selling - a lot of it is still factory sealed. got a good deal on line a while back and bought a ton of 1kg spools for about $8 each, and no, it's not the cheap garbage either).

so the fact i'd have to pay roughly $400+ to replace the 1.7mm filament i own now is incentive to try and do a temporary conversion until i use up the other stuff.

will my .5mm nozzle be ok? i know it's not ideal, but will it be adequate for a while? or should i really get a new nozzle? are there plans or a guide anywhere for the taz 5? is the extruder in the 4 close enough to the 5 that i could use that guide and the 3d models provided?

how different is the taz 4 and 5 extruder model?

problems with stl files from autodesk inventor?,"(i apologize in advance for cross-posting, but on the off chance that this is a hardware problem rather than a software problem, i thought i had better check here as well.)

howdy.  new user (taz 5, 0.5mm nozzle, running tethered using supplied version of cura).

i've gotten over the pains of making sure the z leadscrews are level, leveling the bed, waiting a week for a replacement for the cracked idler bracket (don't ask), but now i'm a bit stymied.

i have printed my bed calibration file, my rocktopus, and 3x replacement idler brackets (not getting shut down by that again), but- i cannot seem to succeed at my first original print.



(screen capture from inventor)

i created the part using the full (paid for) autodesk inventor professional (2014), and exported from inventor to an stl file. there are no discontinuities in the part file (tried to keep it simple, see attached stl file, don't ask my why i used 2016 instead of 2015...). cura appeared to import the file properly. scrolling around it looked fine. scale: 3/16"" at its thickest, 4.25"" long.

i've now attempted to print this file twice in pla on the ""high detail"" mode using the ""pla (esun)"" presets at 220 degrees extruder/60 degrees bed. in each instance, the print failed at, from what i can tell with my calipers, exactly the same point- the transition from flat base to border/lettering.  the extruder kept moving in each case (on each part, you can even see where the extruder either scraped or heated the part as it carried on making the shapes to create the letters), but the feed of plastic into the extruder stopped.

i am trying to figure out if i have somehow exceeded the capacity of the printer (unlikely- none of the letters are less than 1mm thick) or if there is something in the stl conversion process from inventor, or..... ?  wit's end, any help appreciated.

cheers,

andy","the file is fine. inventor will occasionally generate a non manifold stl on particularily complicated parts (especially round ones for some reason) but this one is intact. there are no internal structural wierdness issues, it's manifold, it should print fine. the letters might be a little thin in places. what is probably going on is you are overextruding a bit. depending on the infil level, if you are at or close to 100%, on the last couple layers when it does a 100% solid surface pass, if you are overextruding and if your idler arm springs aren't set right, that can cause backpressure on the molten plastic trying to exit, which in turn is basically the equivelent of trying to extrude plastic through a solid brick wall. the molten plastic stops, which in turn backs up the unmelted plastic, but the hobbed bolt keeps turning, and suddenly you have a c shaped chunk missing from your filliament and nothing comes out. 

first off, check your filliament diameter and see if it matches what you have set in cura. the default is either 3.00mm or 2.85mm, and most of the filliaments out there will range in size from 2.79mm to 3.12mm in width. if you have a smaller setting and are actually extruding a larger filliament, your calculations are off. 

also make sure the distance between the washers outside the springs on the idler arm tension bolts is 8mm. pla might want it a little looser than that, but it's a good place to start.  if they are too loose, the hobbed bolt doesn't cut deep enough into the filliament, and only exerts force on the outer edge, which isn't as strong as it would be if it was cut more deeply into the side. that grinds away, then it continues sawing in until it can't reach anymore plastic."
did i just put a divot in my bed?,"i was prying up a print on my taz 5 with the enclosed spatula or whatever it is and had to put a little force on it. i am noticing a little uneven raised spot on the bed now. is my bed screwed up? i just bought this a few weeks ago so i am wondering if this happens when removing prints and what to do about it?

are we supposed to use glue etc since this is a heated bed? i thought now that it is heated this is not necessary. 

also, what is the proper time to remove a print? is it different for pla, abs and hips?

thanks again,
chris","you shouldn't need any additional treatment to the surface when printing pla or abs... ninjaflex may require a gluestick or something, but don't quote me on that.  lulzbot has guidance on filament specs, but i can't seem to locate them at the moment. the following has some information about the different materials.

as a rule of thumb extrusion temps are marked on the filament spool, or on the manufacturers website.

bed temps vary from material to material.  always let the bed cool lower than 60c before removing parts... this seems critical to the adhesive bonding the pei to glass.

i only print in abs, so can only provide experiences with the material.  i like a bed temp of 110c for the first few layers, then something like 90-100 for the rest of the object if your slicing software supports mid part temp changes.  leaving the temp at 110c, can scorch the part if its a light colored filament.  remove parts at ~50c.  if you find yourself prying on the part too much, try a few drops of ipa around the object... lb sites that alcohol can prematurely dry out the pei, but others have countered that... so do it sparingly.  once you get that part off the bed, give the z-endstop a quarter turn to raise the nozzle higher.

hope that helps.

nozzle temp dropping during print,"hey guys,

i've tried printing this job several times, and only recently noticed why it appears to be failing - my nozzle temperature appears to be dropping from 230c down to 206c during the print. i'm doing an sd card print where the temp has been set to a flat 230c with a heated bed temp of 85c (printing hips). i'm using the taz-5 all-metal print head, and i've been using it for several months without seeing this. from what i can tell, the target temp remains at 230c (as displayed on the lcd panel), but for whatever reason the nozzle temp drops to 206c regardless. the fan is usually set to about 55% at this time.

what would cause this symptom? the power supply? the controller board? the nozzle itself? it only happens after printing for about 5 minutes, it initially has no problem reaching 230c.","geburges wrote:the fan speed may be too high. try manually dropping it down to 40% (or less) and see if the nozzle temp recovers.
that doesn't make much sense to me... even if it maintains its temperature with a lower fan speed, something is definitely wrong as i've been printing with these settings for months.

filament getting stuck.,"i've had the taz 5 for a little over a week and i've loved it. it's been very reliable and consistent up until last night. filament suddenly jams on the slightest retraction. when it jams it not only won't push further into the hotend, it won't pull out without pliers either. snipping the filament to a sharp point and feeding it back through fixes it, until i retract at all., then it jams again. i've had a similar problem on a cheaper printer when the ptfe became damaged, but to knowledge, the hexagon doesn't use ptfe. hopefully this is a common and easily fixed problem? any input is appreciated, thanks!

printing esun pla at 205
with retraction at 20mm/s speed and 2mm distance. it's been working just fine till last night.","the tension started out kinda loose, it was one of the first things i checked. it is now around as tight as when i first go it, and 7 mm from washer to washer. the wheel opposite of the hobbled bolt spins freely in either direction. the filament does have a chewed out section from the hobbled bolt grinding away trying to shove the jammed filament downwards. also, when it is jammed i have to apply upwards force with pliers just to pull out the filament.

i set retraction to .5mm and successfully completed an hour print, but i still don't know why i suddenly can't print on the retraction rate i had been using since i got the printer.

i noticed filament, even when clipped to a sharp point, will slide easily into the hole below the hobbled bolt up until it reaches the depth of where the plastic meets the metal platform at the top of the hexagon hotend. at that point it catches, and i have to apply extra downward force or lift it up and try again until it sinks into the hotend. is that normal? i'm thinking maybe misaligned holes between the plastic and metal?"

trouble with prints staying down.,"i'm a newb - somewhat competent with good guidance.

i've been going nuts printing things with decent results - and learning as i go.

however, i've been trying to print a 6x6 piece - and i just can't keep the ends from eventually coming up sometime during the print.  i've tried abs and pla -  still same results.

i have a taz5 with the pei bed - i've been using the cura stock setting for standard definition print for each filament. i have leveled the bed using a dial indicator - however with all 4 corners zero'd there seems to be bow in the center of the bed that goes from front to back.  the bow pops up by about .010-.012"".  or  .25-.30mm (i'm still trying to get the metric lingo down).  -   i put a straight edge on the bed, and can't really see it, though this should be easy to see.   so maybe it's the x axis bowing in the middle or the slop that i do have in the x axis bearings.   

i set my z height off the center of the bed, which is the highest height.  it's set about .005"" or .13mm.     i ran the dial indicator around what would roughly be the 4 outer corners of the 6"" square to see the bed height difference and it's about .005"" or .13mm lower than the center of the bed at all 4 corners of the 6"".  

i'm kind of at a loss,  i'd like to figure it out, as i have a ton of things i would like to make that will even be bigger than the 6"" square i am making now with poor results.  any help or guidance would be appreciated!

i'll post a pic.","ok,  ran the same print last night -  the differences being:

- cleaned the bed well with iso alc.  
- turned off the cooling fan completely
- leveled the bed several times using the calibration gcode. i took the time to measure the height of the extruded lines around the table to assist. i was able to get the bed pretty darn close this way.   
- i slung a blacket over both sides of the taz frame, kind of leaving the center open, hopeing to eliminate a little bit of draft.

all looked decent when i went to bed,   but woke up to the corners pulling again - but this time the corner that has always pulled the worst, was the corner that pulled the least( it was also the corner best protected by the blanket now)  the skirt extrude around the exterior measured about .43mm - .47mm in different places.  initial layer height was set at .425 in the stock abs profile. 

note - i had the initial z height set lower - but what i experienced was that as the first layers went down they smooshed so much that the layer being laid down pushed up the layers it was being laid next to . i raised it until it stopped doing this.

looking at the parts lulzbot made it sure looks like their initial layers are very fat and spread apart more than mine are..   hmmm   could
be nothing...   i'm to new to know.

anyway come morning all 4 corners pulled - but the part was better overall - but not truly acceptable results.

so - i have a couple more things to play with -
   - going to make a drop over cardboard box cover to ghetto hot box it
   - going to try a brim to see if it will help hold the ends down

there is still a ton of suggestions here for me to work through - thank you to everyone who has been helping.

piercecat love the open rail conversions you have done - i'm probably going to venture into those mods next.    

will report back with more results as i go -"
wavy wall if print speed is not very low?,"hello together,
i just receaved my new taz 5 and now i'm trying to calibrate it  
i had a quick look at cura and printed a hollow test cube for wall thickness test, but then i switched over to slic3r because i feel more comfortable with it. the first cube with slic3r had a wavy structure on the walls (all 4 sides equal). i compared parameters between cura and slic3r, now i know it's the print speed.

see the picture attached, from left to right you can see following print speeds:
1. 10mm/s
2. first half of cube 15mm/s, then 10mm/s
3. 25mm/s

the first two cubes on the left are nice smooth, but the right one is ""wavy"". you can see it best in the middle of the side wall.

printing at 15mm/s maximum on outer perimeter sounds quite slow to me, what can be done do get higher print speeds? i was not able to track this error with guides found with google.. maybe bearings? i noticed that the original bushes has a ""lot"" of visible play to the rods?","12/5:  i have a surface waviness problem.  i'm getting significant waviness on large horizontal surfaces like ripples on water - like if you take a glass of water and tap its side.  it's really bad.  this is regardless of temperatures and speed, though these items have a minor effect.  i can somewhat change the nature of the waviness by moving parts to different locations on the bed and by changing plastic colors.
i make large parts and quickly wore out the stock bearings.  i replaced them with misumi linear ball bearings and hardened shafts about 6 months ago, i recall. the bearings were carefully mounted to ensure easy action along the full range of travel.  
it seems my problem is harmonic vibrations.  i can feel them by resting a finger on the bed or extruder.  i believe know the solution; it's old-fashioned sintered bronze bushings.  i gotta find me some that will fit the misumi 10mm shafts.  if anyone has found and installed bronze bushings, i would appreciate your insight.

12/6:  i've ordered a dozen sleeve bearings from amazon ($50 including shipping). i can't find a direct replacement of the same size as the current bearing (which would be very heavy anyway).  the bearings are sae 841 (sintered bronze) 10 mm id x 14 mm od x 25 mm l.  i'll design/print sleeves to bring these new bearings to the size of the current bearings (19 mm d x 29 mm l).  i'll edit this post with my results."
freezing/stops mid print [solved],"hi,

had my rambo repaired (taz 4) for a blown extruder mosfet last year (out of warranty now). looks like i'm having the same issue, extruder motor completely stops mid print (manual jogs don't work as well). seems to work again after power cycling the printer.

lulzbot support previously told me i can use the 2nd connector on the electronics case (the one for the duel extruder). i just have to upload a certain firmware.

does anyone happen to have a link for that or know what to change in the firmware code?

thanks!

edit: swapped out the rambo and upgraded the extruder to the hex extruder. still have the same issues. it may be the power supply fan that went out. read several posts with the same issue and it was resolved with a new power supply.

agree with the prior post about tweaking your firmware, as going to a dual extruder firmware will also (i think) require adding a 100k resistor across the thermistor pins for the unconnected extruder to give the board a dummy input for the second thermistor, otherwise it won't heat.

to answer your original question though- based on your warranty comment, i'm guessing you have a taz 4 with budaschnozzle?
if you have cura 17.10 or newer- machine> add new machine.  choose the appropriate printer and dual extruder hotend to match you current hotend (v1 for taz 4/buda, v2 for taz 5/ hexagon), then flash the firmware when prompted.

i'm new to 3d printing and just ordered a taz 5. i'm hoping that the community can help me know if there are any must-have accessories or tools i should get to go along with my new machine. i'm looking for the basics to get started successfully.

thanks!","dennisgriffin wrote:
it looks like it attaches this gauge to the print head, and you measure at each corner to ensure that at each corners the print head is a uniform distance from the bed. do you leave this permanently attached? how often do you level the bed? every time you start a print?


it will make more sense when you get the machine in front of you, but you're on track.

the dial gauges attach to either side of the tool head (what you're calling the print head... which is actually the extruder, hotend and carrier).  measure the distance to each corner of the bed... get all the corners equal.

remove the dial gauge(s) when you're done leveling the bed.

the bed doesn't need to be leveled that often... just when you change a nozzle, switch toolheads or if prints aren't sticking on one-side/corner... etc.  for me it seems to be a once a month-ish. the pei bed is really nice and forgiving, abs sticks to it pretty well once the nozzle height is dialed in.

each time you finish a print, examine the bottom (surface against bed).  the striations from the extruded filament, usually tells you if the bed may need leveling.


here's my method:



dsc02532.jpg (33.33 kib) viewed 1638 times



using two dial guages just makes things quicker.  set the front corners, set the rear corners, then go back to check the front corners again.  regardless of the number of dial guages, make sure to home xy then move the toolhead to the center of x before attaching the guages.


edit:  get yourself a nice set of locking [urlhttp://www.amazon.com/hemostats-curved-5-strai ... 530t5947s4]forceps[/url].  good for grabbing that stub of filament when you smoke the filament spool to the nub.  you'll get tweezers in the tool kit which will work to grab the filament also.  but the locking forceps get into the tight space and lock on to the filament stub allowing you to pull it out.  its another one of those things you'll understand better when you get the machine."

as for the infill my guess would be around 100% on most parts, you can find the gcode for the parts at: http://download.lulzbot.com/taz/5.0/pro ... ted_parts/ those gcodes are for abs. 

if somebody here does not have the answer to the infill, you can try to check the gcode in a gcode viewer like http://gcode.ws/. and skim though the layers and check if you see any lower infill typically lines crossing or other patterns."

idea for removing pei from bed,"hi all,

i've had a sheet of pei surface on my taz 4 for about a year now. i purchased the pei and 3m adhesive from amazon and installed it myself. i went with a thicker piece of pei than lulzbot provides, maybe about 5/32 thick. i used the 3m adhesive and attached the pei directly to the glass bed. i had successful abs prints for many months, but recently started noticing some lifting on finished parts. i thought it was the part separating from the pei bed, but upon closer inspection, i noticed it was the pei lifting from the glass bed due to the pull of the abs while printing. i decided i needed to install a new sheet of pei since the adhesive seemed to be failing. removing the old pei was a mess, since so much adhesive was left stuck to the glass bed. i did eventually get it all removed and cleaned. but now i'm thinking it might be good to install the pei on top of a sheet of pet tape. this way if i need to remove the pei in the future. it's as simple as removing the pet tape from the glass, which usually doesn't leave behind residual adhesive. does anyone see any issue with doing this?","i'd just go with a removable print surface like printinz...

","not knowing much about your setup and slicing parameters, the two things that i would check:
1) does your filament move freely through the entire print?  i have had issues like this when my filament has gotten ""wedged"" somewhere before the extruder.  for me, this usually happens with new spools of filament when the filament pops over the edge of the spool and gets itself wrapped around the axle.   
2) are your material cooling fans cooling down the hotend?  i recently built a mangrove extruder and used the dual fans on high.  the hotend cooled some much that the filament jammed in the hotend. "
heating simultaneously,is it possible to heat bed and head simultaneously or is it not possible because of the serial structure of gcode?,"it is possible but can be hard on your power supply.  the pwm frequency is vastly different between the two heaters.  some have indicated in the past that the much lower frequency of the the bed heaters is hard on the supply and this is compounded by heating the extruder simultaneously.  there are mcodes for heating extruders and beds that either heat and wait or heat and release control.  to heat both you will want to set the extruder temp with m104 sxxx followed by m190 sxx to heat the bed. this will set extruder temp and release control then immediately set bed temp and wait.  once the bed heats to the requested temperature, control is released back to host.  the other issue here is that the extruder heats much faster than the bed and will begin to ooze while it waits.  one solution is to heat the extruder to below the extrusion temp say m104 s160, then heat bed m190 s85, the finish heating extruder with m109 s225.

fundamental differences between mini and taz 5?,"hi all! first post here. i have had a mini since july and have been largely successful with my prints. i am using cura to slice and running it from octoprint on a beagleboneblack. i have been printing exclusively with abs from ic3d. about two weeks ago i decided to get a taz 5 because i wanted the larger print surface, so i ordered one with the mattercontrol touch tablet option. 

my results with the taz have been frustrating at best and i have noticed some peculiarities. i have been getting a lot of layer separation which i have narrowed down to needing a good enclosure for the taz. the odd part is that it is sitting only 2 feet from my mini, which reliably cranks out perfect prints without an enclosure and using the same spool of filament. i have no issues with the first layer adhesion. in fact, it almost sticks too well. 

the other oddity is with cura. loading the same model with the same print parameters will yield different print times between the two machines. as much as a two hour difference. this boggles me because i would assume that once the hot end starts the first layer all things would be equal when trying to print the same model. 

tl;dr version: 
1: assuming the environmental conditions and print parameters are identical, why would the taz need an enclosure when the mini does not?
2: given that the print parameters are set identically in cura for both machines, why would the taz generate a longer print time for the same model?","that's interesting... outside of the larger heavier print bed there are no differences.  when i switched machines in cura, the print time for the rocktopus stayed the same.  

taz 5 default profile:






mini default profile:






try downloading the latest cura and reinstalling... completely uninstall the previous to ensure a fresh start.  the one thing i didn't do was transfer the pre-configured machine settings when switching to ""expert"" settings.

interesting thing, when i switched back to ""quickprint"" the time was reduced to 36min from 57min... but was equal duration for both machines.  based on that, i would say lulzbot has tweaked the ""quickprint"" settings for the machines...  i'm not a cura user, so maybe others have better input.

for your ""splitting"" issues on the taz 5, try increasing the extrusing temps by a degree or two.  the larger bed, is most likely more demanding on the stepper motors taxing the psu a bit more.  

every printer is unique and settings need to be adapted.  check for any drafts from hvac vents also..."

about to give up on pla,i've had the lulzbot hexagon hotend since march and have yet to be able to print successfully with pla. abs prints great but pla is another story. at first i thought it was heat creep so i tried one of the blower fans on the heatsink but the problem persisted. i even tried the latest mangrove extruder carriage with front mounted 5v fan. still no luck. i've tried switching between both esun and village plastics pla. same problem. what else could my issue be except heat creep?,"that's realy strange. i throught it might be under extrusion or too cold extrusion. but with your values, that should be ok. why i was asking for free air extrusion: if you did no perfect cold-pull when switching from abs to pla, there might be some abs in the nozzle that blocks the flow.
i would recommend the following procedure:
1) load esun pla (because i'm also using it, so i know it)
2) heat it up to 240°. stay by the printer, don't let it be that hot for long time!
3) when reaching 240°, extrude 20-50mm of filament at about 100mm/min to be shure there is no abs left
4) cool down to 205°, extrude some mm of filament time to time to be shure no pla is burning in the hot nozzle.
5) get slic3r 1.2.9, load the config bundle in my attachment. change your nozzle size in the printer tab to 0.35 and adjust the z-offset to your needs
6) slice and print a test part with it.

0.35 adapter,"hey guys i am new to 3d printing, and lulzbot printer 5, i would like to print in little more detail, where can i get the .35 mm adapter? or i need the whole new printer head?","you do not need to do anything with the firmware for a nozzle change.  you need to change the nozzle size and possibly the initial layer thickness on the advance tab.
change the shell thickness to a multiple of the nozzle size (1.05 is 3 shells of .35mm),  bottom/top thickness on the basic tab to something smaller than the nozzle size, layer height to something less than .28.

i don't know of any videos of changing the nozzle.  what i do is first bring the nozzle up to print temp then let it cool to about 2/3rds the full temp and pull the filament out by hand.  then heat back up to print temp.  using two wrenches (i use a crescent wrench and an 8mm wrench)
use the larger one on the heater block to prevent it from turning as you use the 8mm to unscrew the nozzle tip.  then i let the temp drop down to 2/3 and push the rest of the plastic out with either fresh filament or an allen wrench.  install the new nozzle with the 8mm wrench and again holding the heater block so it will not turn.  make it snug, but do not over tighten or you could damage the nozzle or block.
insert new fiber and heat up to temp and run a couple of hundred mm of filament through.  make sure the filament comes out nice and straight.  if it starts to curl, you may need to remove and clean out the nozzle.

taz 5 80mm fan shroud --  files linked,"this thread goes along with my post about taz 5 pla random clogging issues and a solution.  i needed to create a way to provide a serious amount of cooling for my taz 5 / hexagon hotend.  the little ""squirrel cage"" fan was just....  cute.  no offense to the taz designers!  i love my machine   but seriously, that small fan was way too small, and it was actually really noisy.  so, as all good do-it-yourselfers would do, i designed and printed my own along with a filament tube retainer.

the filament tube retainer is a modified version of http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:766614 created by wolfie, and the fan shroud is my original design.  

the intent of the shroud is to provide as much air flow across the cooling fins right above the heater block in the hotend itself, while preventing any airflow across the heater block.  i also wanted to provide some additional air flow across the entire filament feed assembly, but i wanted it to look and feel as if it were a stock item.  the shroud itself went great, but i realized that i wanted to keep the filament tube retainer that i had (wolfie's design), plus i needed a way to anchor the top of fan shroud.  slight design change = win.

as promised, here is the link to the .stl files and the cura profile i used to print this.  they're over at thingiverse

here's some pictures of the shroud itself.  i printed it using pla.  i figured i'd really get to see if the clearance around the hotend was enough if the pla didn't melt 





















here's the filament tube retainer on the left, the fan shroud in the center, and the stock extruder assembly on the right.






and here it is assembled:




","i've had many the same nights..  failed print after failed print.  i've done a ton of reading, and nothing out there has helped.  i finally stumbled across two things that 'so far' have fixed my problems.  the first one, and i believe this was the major contributor, was that i've had rolls of plastic in my cabinet since i built it - 7 months ago.  i was trying to swap out a roll for a different color, and when i tried to bend the end over (of the old roll) to hook it to the spool, the wire snapped like a twig.  i mean really brittle.  i know this isn't normal, so i tried it on several of my rolls, and i found that just about every roll i've had trouble with was like this.

okay, so for me, lesson #1 was - old plastic = really brittle.  

since my feed system is different than stock, i'm certain i was introducing a lot of unnecessary tension on the plastic, leading to very easy ""jams"" that were actually just wire that was too hard to pull....

to test out that last statement, i took apart my fancy schmancy setup, and stuck a roll on top of my cabinet, hanging on a broom handle.  i put clamps around it so it wouldn't move too much, but could easily feed/roll.  i then completely rebuilt my entire extruder assembly and leveled my bed within .0005""

the simplest things were just killing me the whole time (i think).  i've got a ton of big prints coming up.  i hope i've got it figured out!  either way, let's keep this topic open, and try to solve this common issue!!

i printed 3 items that were all 7+ hour prints, with zero issues.  (i probably just jinxed myself silly for saying that...)  i'm attaching pictures of the indicator setup i used to level the bed, and of the prints.  the last picture (of the turbo wheel) was done with no supports, 8mm brim.  all items were printed with pla @ 185°c, bed @ 60°c.

taz 5 or mini,"hello,
i am returning my 2nd mini. the first one's y axis didn't move at all and this one skips line infills as well as a few other issues. these printers were my first 3d printers and now i am considering if i should get the taz 5 and maybe upgrade using the topics with the rail extrusions and all that? what would you suggest for a first time user? should i get my 3rd mini and hope for the best or go with taz 5 this time?",i actually don't like it. i want to it myself. i can also make that system later as i learn. i have seen someone already do it. i also want to upgrade to aluminum extrusion rails. how much of a prior experience i should get to upgrade my future system to yours? can i do it as soon as i receive it following your procedure or you suggest me gaining experience first?
taz 3 - control box fan noise fix?,"i just bought a refurb taz 3 and am very pleased with it other than the horrendous electrical noise coming from the control box fan. to be clear, the noise isn't from the movement of the fan blades pushing air. if i stop the fans from moving with my finger, i still hear the noise. 

i suspect it's from the rambo (version 1.2f btw) using pwm to control the fan speed. is there a fix for this? i wouldn't mind just having it run at 100% all the time. i swapped in different fans and they all have the same noise. 

does the rambo 1.3 have this same ""problem""?","here's the output when i hook up to the printer with the arduino ide:

"taz 5 0.35mm --> 0.5mm, firmware?","when i switched from a 0.35 nozzle to a 0.5 nozzle was i supposed to flash the firmware? i definitely changed the diameter in my slicer(s)... but after using cura today i saw that it recommends a firmware flash after a toolhead change. i assume that's changing between single/dual/flexy/dualy... but what about nozzle diameter?

additionally, can someone explain why different toolheads need different firmware?","just so i have this straight... i had a taz 5 with a 0.35 mm nozzle. i upgraded the hot end to a 0.5mm nozzle. no firmware upgrade required. got it.

today, i'm installing a flexystruder v2. i know i need to update the firmware. reference: https://ohai.lulzbot.com/project/flexys ... bot-taz-5/

the last few sentences of this guide read: ""to switch back to the original tool head, follow the same steps outlined in this guide, except this time, select the standard lulzbot taz tool head and options.""

do i need to flash the firmware again to use the regular toolhead?

can i print abs/pla with the flexystruder? when would i want to switch back to 0.5mm?

other than the fully enclosed feeder (forgive my lack of technical nomenclature here) and increased diameter nozzle, what are the print differences one would expect with this extruder?

thanks again!"
small part z-height dragging,"i'm testing the limitations of small part printing and have a weird issue. my extruder begins to drag through layers. it seems like the outside perimeter is extruding too much, building up, and causing the drag. i can print larger parts with no issue - so i don't think it's hardware... i'm using a 0.5mm and have tried 0.18 and 0.25 layer heights (both with 0.6mm width) - no difference. i'm using s3d for slicing and have tried 0% infill (just perimeter) and 100% infill, but s3d doesn't perform the infill lines - it skips them.

thoughts?

","it might be due to heat in your part, you nozzle is dragging above not fully cooled lines. on big parts, there is no isue because during travel moves your old lines are coold down and the hot nozzle is toughing them only a short time. maybe also in combination with shrinking, the lines become ""smaller"" if they are cooled down, so they have a little bit more space to the nozzle than the fresh laid hot ones.

so, try to increase your fan speed or print 2 or more parts at once. as for the infill, i have no idea. maybe a bug.."
y axis problem,"hi after many successful hours of printing suddenly my y axis will not zero. it gets to about 2 inches from the contact switch and the stepper motor pauses and hitches and then continues and then stops and then finally gets to the stop.

the first symptom occurred mid print when suddenly the printing in the y axis was way off. (like 75mm or so)

is this the:

motor
harness
system board

i checked the belt and it seems fine. tension is good and i can't find any missing teeth. 

how do i troubleshoot this?","piercet wrote:the shaft is integral to the motor core. it's glued in but good. if it's twitching and not moving, that generally indicates half the motor wires are reversed and in magnetic oposition to the other half of the magnet in the motor. that would be wierd to just start occuring though. usually you have to have one set of motor pins reversed for that to occur. unless you swapped out a motor recently or had a pin fall out of the housing, thats unlikely. only other thing i can think of is debris on the bed preventing movement. try unscrewing the y bed anchor mount from the bed and run it back and forth and see if it still jams.

well the thing is the motor seems to operate fine and then stops as it approaches the relay stop. and then it seems to continue running, but the bed stops moving. after a few seconds it moves again and hits the stop. but while i can hear the stepper running, the bed is not moving and the shaft and pulley are stationary. it's like the motor is stalling. but the bed moves freely by hand."
new taz 5 owner - how do i use my tool bag?,"hi everyone,

i'm a proud new owner of the taz 5! printing my first taz 5 print as i write this. i love the nice tool bag that came with the printer, but i don't feel like i know what they're really meant for. i'm familiar with how to use these tools, but not necessarily in the context of 3d printing. i figured since they were included in the tool bag, they must be used in ways i haven't thought of.

here are the contents of my tool bag:

hex driver set - used to assemble print head and level bed.
pliers - used to cut plastic filament. what else?
metal ruler - used to measure/level bed. anything else?
metal rod with rubber covering sharp end. - ???
x-acto knife - i assume used for pruning/touch-ups?
tiny metal brush - ???
sharp knife with blue handle - ???
tweezers - picking small parts off the print bed?

thanks! i'm excited to be part of this community.","here's how i use them:

hex driver set.  once the taz is assembled, you really only need (mostly) the 2.5mm for bed leveling and changing the extruder.  this is the nicest allen key set that i have.  i got a bag of very cheap 25 mm keys for this purpose, and leave complete set in my printer tool drawer.

pliers.  don't use them much, mainly for removing internal support material.  i use diagonal cutters for filament.

metal ruler.  stays in tool drawer.  i have a little ""jig"" made with a soda straw that i use for extruder calibration.

metal rod with rubber covering sharp end.  i use it as needed to pick ground-in filament out of the hobbed bolt on the extruder.

x-acto knife.  yes, for touching up parts.

tiny metal brush.  also for cleaning debris off and around the hobbed bolt.

sharp knife with blue handle.  the infamous ""clam knife""!  stays in drawer.  everyone comes up with their own unique tool for getting parts off the bed; i use a french chef's knife.

tweezers.  i use these for nipping ""splooge"" and hangy-threads from the hot end, usually between when the print head does the initial home and when is actually starts printing.

i've had my taz almost exactly a year now.  if you haven't done 3d printing before, start small and unambitious.  then keep moving more challenging pieces.  have fun!"
taz 5 froze during long print job,"hello everyone, this is my first post to this forum.  our company just bought a taz 5 and am absolutely loving it, a big step up from my flashforge creator at home (which i still like a lot).  i am looking forward to interacting with the members here and picking up some knowledge, and hopefully sharing at least a little.

the taz 5 froze about 9.5 hours into a 15 hour print job.  i was driving it from a pc, with all screen savers, shutdown etc disabled.  i closed my programs down for the night (except cura) and left the pc on.  a few minutes later the taz just stopped.

after realizing it didn't look like it would recover, i tried clicking the z +10 button on the control window, just to see if it would respond.  no response.  so it seemed like it lost communication with the pc.  the front panel on the taz still said 240 for the extruder and 110 for the bed, and it showed the fan icon running at 40% (which fan is that, btw?)

as a last-ditch i tried unplugging and re-plugging both ends of the usb cable.  after i did that, it re-connected with cura, but did not resume printing (not surprised).  however, i was then able to move the z axis.  knowing the print job was toast, i shut the whole thing down and went home.

not super bummed, i wasn't liking the way the print was going anyway, in terms of support features i selected.  so i will probably try again tomorrow.  i will most likely use a sd card so i don't have to rely on the usb communications. 

i would appreciate any thoughts or suggestions.  thanks!","the usb connection seems very intolerant of a number of issues.  i find that if other usb devices change state, the usb connection to the printer will be lost.  also, it looks like static electricity can cause a loss of the usb connection.  i find the best solution is to print from the sd card.
you can still control the printer via your software as long as the usb link is up, but if it does go down, the print will continue printing from the sd card.  you can even reset the usb port and regain connection during the print.

hot end temperature dropping when heated bed is on,"hello guys,
today i started experiencing something very weird with my lulzbot taz 5. i'm wondering if anybody has an idea on what is happening.
whenever i turn my heated bed on my nozzle temperature starts to fluctuate and while printing can drop 10 or 15 degrees. 

because of the symptoms i think it is the power supply not giving enough juice for the printer. any other guess? or a good way to test the problem and isolate to get to a conclusion?
already tested setting the temperature using the taz lcd and the same thing happens.

my printer also used to get to the set temperature pretty quick, not it is taking more than 10 minutes for the nozzle to get near the set temperature. i'm sing lulzbot standard firmware. 

follow some charts that i got from octoprint.









","vitormhenrique wrote:thanks for the reply guys,
after one more night of test, i swapped the extruder and the problem does not happen with a second extruder. so i guess my heater element is somehow damaged and having a weird interaction with the heated bed. i'll try to analyze the pwm signal for the heater cartridge with a oscilloscope and see what's going on.

hmm... this is good to know.  could simply be wear and tear on the hotend heater."
extruder tension knobs slipping,"hi all,

not sure if this has ever been asked (didn't find anything in a quick search).  i have been having on-and-off issues with the common problem of having extrusion quit in the middle of a print due to the hobbed bolt stripping the filament.  i've gone through a *lot* of adjustments to try to address this, and generally have the problem minimized.

however, i had a print going last night, and this morning extrusion had quit and the filament was stripped again.  what i noticed for the first time, though, was that the idler tension knobs seemed to have loosened considerably from where i had set them yesterday morning.  fyi, i had loaded the filament yesterday morning, tightened the knobs, and did a number of successful shorter prints throughout the day.

so, now i am wondering if my problems in this area are due to the idler tension knobs slowly working their way loose over the course of several prints.  i have not seen any discussion of this anywhere.  has anybody else noticed this happening?  if so, have you noticed any correlation with stripped filament?  and, more importantly, have you come up with any solution to keep the knobs from working loose?

dave levi","if the hobbed bolt is ""eating"" through the filament, this could be a signs of a clog, partially blocked filament path or signs of worse things to come.  

what type of filament?  if its pla, then you'll want to double check that you're not experiencing heat creep from the lack of cooling of the heatsink.  if enough heat travels up the all-metal hotend, the filament will swell when close to melting... and clog the hotend.

if abs, then a few more turns on the tensioner knobs should help.  the springs between the idler and tensioner knob should keep the screws from slipping.  piercet's advice of ~8mm between the knob and idler is good.  heat creep won't affect abs as much due to the higher melting point.

i've noticed on my machine (after 9 months), the extruder body and hotend may need ""re-alignment"" to ensure a smooth path for filament.  i feel a slight ""obstruction"" impeding the filament as it feeds into the hotend... more tension on the idler helps this as well.  it could also be the ""teeth marks"" from the hobbed bolt catching somewhere along the path."
original taz with dual extruder error,"hello

i just installed the dual extruder head for my original taz.  did the firmware updates and have it opened in cura.

i am hoping someone can point me in the right direction to troubleshoot.

thanks!","original taz?  the dual extruder is noted as only being compatible with taz 4 & 5.

taz4 --> taz5,"two easy questions...

1.  i have a taz4 that has now been upgraded to the use the latest hexagon hotend.  works like a charm.  does that mean my taz4 is now a taz5, or are there additional upgrades?

2.  i also have a flexystruder.  (incidentally, ninjaflex has been the easiest filament to use that i've tried so far.)  when i switch between the flexystruder and v2 hex hotend, does the firmware need to be changed for the specific one being used, or will one of the firmware versions work for both?","thank you, piercet.  i've gone well off the reservation with respect to the bed (many different materials--and cut glass pieces with different tapes and surfaces--that i clip on to the plain glass stock bed).  existing power supply certainly isn't giving me any problems.

only outstanding question is with respect to whether the firmware needs to keep being changed for each of the extrunders."
guide on upgrading taz4 with e3d v6,"hi,
i decided to write down here the steps i took to complete an upgrade of the taz4 to a e3d v6 24v hot end. as it seemed i had to look around to a few different places to find all the details. also included are some changes to marlin for the auto extruder fan to work properly.

let's start, so you got your new e3d v6 hot end and it is the 24v one. btw this guide is for the direct version.
assembly
assemble the hot end following these instructions http://wiki.e3d-online.com/wiki/e3d-v6_assembly
mount
print this mount here http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:905350, much better than the original design by chipchap420, although credits to him for coming with the original idea! e3d v6 fits perfectly on this mount and you don't have to use tape or other stuff to keep it from moving as in other solutions. you will need 2x m3 20mm screws and 2x m3 nuts.
connecting everything... 
i took the easy path and connected the extruder fan together with the fan that taz 4 already had for cooling the filament. then connected the thermistor and heat cartridge to a 4 pin header, the 2 cables of the thermistor next to each other and the 2 cables of the heat cartridge next to them, following basically how budaschnozzle is connected. just be careful to connect them correctly back to where the budaschnozzle was connected.
flashing taz
before flashing the taz remember to note the steps configuration. follow the first set of instructions from here: link https://www.lulzbot.com/support/fi ... rough-cura
the simple part is downloading the marlin source code from here: https://www.lulzbot.com/support/downloads
then search on configuration.h file and change the following:
code: select all#define temp_sensor_0 7
to
code: select all#define temp_sensor_0 5
code: select all#define bang_max 70 // limits current to nozzle while in bang-bang mode; 255=full current
#define pid_max 74 // limits current to nozzle while pid is active
to
code: select all#define bang_max 150
#define pid_max 155

now if you want you can do the following changes in order to have the fans working automatically whenever the nozzle temperature goes above 40.
set
code: select all#define extruder_fan_setup 4
and a few lines below check that the extruder_0_auto_fan_pin is set to the correct fan_pin (ex_fan_0 by default which also equals fan_pin which is actually 8 for motherboard = 301)
now this should be enough since the fans should be turned on from within the temperature.cpp, which they do but almost instantly the shuts off from the planner.cpp as i found out after some debugging.
so to workaround this i added the following:
code: select all#if defined(extruder_0_auto_fan_pin) && extruder_0_auto_fan_pin > -1
  if (current_temperature[0] > extruder_auto_fan_temperature) 
    analogwrite(ex_fan_0,255);
#else
  analogwrite(ex_fan_0,tail_fan_speed);
#endif 
at line 508

now you are ready to flash taz!
 pid autotune
connect using pronterface and send the command
code: select allm303 e0 s200 c8
at the end it will give you some values. mine were the following:
code: select allrecv:  clasic pid
recv:  kp: 48.25
recv:  ki: 4.66
recv:  kd: 124.91

and set them using the following command:
code: select all m301 p48.25 i4.66 d124.91 

more here: http://reprap.org/wiki/pid_tuning
 set extruder steps per unit
remember you had written down some values? well now is the time to put them back in...
follow the step update your extruder steps per unit from here https://www.lulzbot.com/support/firmwar ... rough-cura
 re-calibrate your z axis
the new hot end is a bit taller than buda, so remember to recalibrate your z axis before you start printing...

happy printing!

p.s. i hope i didn't forget anything...
another good reference post is here: viewtopic.php?t=1034","ok, this is driving me nuts and maybe you can help!

i am just wrapping up a number of big upgrades to my kittaz (basically a taz 4), including fsr sensors under the bed for auto leveling  and an e3d duel extruder cyclops hot end with bowden tubes to dual ezstruders with geared steppers. i have everything setup and working on the marlin firmware. i have 2 problems but i'll focus on the pid autotune issue here.

i am using the stock kittaz marlin release ""2014q3"" on the startup screen on the lcd (this comes from the bitmap image embedded in the firmware). i want to run m303 to autotune pid and nothing happens. in pronterface, it just sits there after echoing ""pid autotune start"" but nothing happens - no temperature increase on the hot end as you would expect. my command is: 

m303 e0 s200 c8

if i do the same in repetier host, it also echo pid autotune start but it cycles through showing ""1 command waiting"" and ""idle"" but again no heating. i know the hot end, etc works as i've made a few test prints already and just want to tune the pid. anyone experience this or have any suggestions?

how to remove pei,"step 1... forget glue...
step 2... print ninjaflex semiflex..
step 3...






step 4... i hit the build plate with alcohol and let it soak, scraped with a razor... repeated... took a few tries to get all the adhesive off but it's a squeaky clean build plate now.","you don't say... 

i just started the process of removing the pei from my 2nd taz 5, as i only print semiflex and my ability to apply glue evenly is apparently questionable.  (i missed a spot and popped a dime size hole out of the 2nd print bed removing it.)

i'd strongly suggest anyone doing lots of ninjaflex/semiflex prints to simply buy the glass bed or use blue tape where you can't miss a spot."
taz 5 extruder issue.,"issue:

hello lulzbot community! i have been having an issue getting my lulzbot to properly extrude and i'm not sure what to do. to begin, i have already soaked the nozzle in acetone for 2 days. i have fed wire through the nozzle to clean out anything that could possibly be clogging it, and i'm using lulzbot pla just to be safe. 

 i start hand feeding pla(or any plastic) through the nozzle and it feeds fine. when i switch over to the hobble gear feeding i get issues with no feed and the gear chews a spot out of the plastic. on the other hand, if i feed the plastic through by hand, tell the software to start rotating the gear, and then apply the tension bolts, it will feed continuously until i pause the gear for a couple seconds. i think the video below will help you all see what i am dealing with.

if you can't clear a nozzle with cold pulls and you are running pla, you can soak it in scigrip 4 to dissolve the pla. i have not had any luck dissolving pla with anything else. scigrip 4 is to pla what acetone is to abs. use gloves and ventilation, it contains nastyness.

i just drop my nozzles right in the can with tweezers and let them soak at room temp for several hours.

if it's the same issue that i'm having then maybe your little small fan is cooling that feed chamber enough. when you pull it out is that top area very malleable and squishy?"

i loaded the stl file into slic3r then exported a new stl file which is about 1/5th the size!   
when i printed using the new slic3r stl file in cura, the printout turned out much better.

the stl files are obviously very different but i have no understanding of the stl file contents. 
i have posted the slic3r stl file for comparison should anyone have that knowledge/bent to investigate.
it appears that cura doesn't correctly interpret the 123d stl file but slic3r can.
i'm not sure if i should contact autodesk since slic3r can process the file or if this is a cura issue."

print failures / clog / hobbed bolt eating into filament,"hi, 

i have a serious issue with my taz 5. every single print fails right now. and the failures always look like on the pictures below. 
the hobbed bolt eats away at the filament and no material comes out the nozzle anymore. 

here's what i tried so far to fix the issue:
- completely cleaned the nozzle from any material
- made sure that the filament path is clear of any obstructions
- loosened/tightened the hobbed bolt to see if that makes a difference
- tried higher temperature settings

at first this issue only occured when there was a lot of retraction action but now it even occurs without retraction. material also doesn't make a difference. i mostly use pla and colorfabb xt. same problem on both. 

what else can i try to fix this issue? i appreciate any ideas!

thanks!","thank you guys for all the ideas. 

i took the extruder head apart and made sure that the small gear sits really tight on the stepper motor. then i noticed that the small fan that blows at the heatsink above the hot end may have been pointing downwards, so i corrected its position. i also checked the materials that i had pulled out of the hot end previously to understand what might have gone wrong and it does indeed look like the material cooled down during retraction and then got stuck. so i was pretty happy with my fan recovery and correction. 
finally i made sure the idler screws are in proper position and then i did a test print. 

the test print turned out perfectly. great!

i felt ready to try a proper print again and used the following settings:
material: pla from colorfabb
layer height: 0.2mm
temp:  194 degrees
speed: 40mm/s
retraction distance: 1mm
retraction speed: 40mm/s

the print started out great... and then failed as you can see from the photo. 

i am really out of ideas. what else can i try?

thanks,

taz 5 bed doesn't reach temperature with flexy dually on,"hello,

i am having a problem with my taz 5.  when i install the flexy dually head onto the printer and load the arduino add ons software, the heated bed never gets to the proper temperature, and therefor never starts a print.  it gets to 2-3 degrees under the set temperature and just stops heating up.  

not sure if it's pertinent  but i am using a raspberry pi with the octopi image to control the taz.  i setup the dual extruders in the software and can control both extruders just fine. it is only the bed temperature that is having issue.  

i believe i have followed the installation instructions properly, but just can't figure this out.  i have reloaded the default software through cura once and restarted the process thinking i may have missed something to no avail.  i am not sure if it has to do with the fact that the software is based on the taz4 instead of the taz5, but i doubt it since i have seen people say it's working on the forums, and the simple fact that they wouldn't advertise the dual extruder if it didn't work.  i have tried to search the forums for this issue and haven't found it. 

any help is greatly appreciated.  

thanks","i've had a similar problem with my flex dually but in regards to the bed temp. this is definitely a software issue and it does not seem to help to set the pid.  the temp on the lcd will say 110. the temp feed back to the cura window is 109.7 to 109.8.  it seems to have a +/- factor of .1-.4 in my case always a - factor. this causes an issue with the command to wait for bed temp. i can trick it by setting my bed temp higher via the lcd than i set in the software. for example, i tell the software 110. start the print and it just sits and waits forever. then i modify the temp on the lcd to 111 and let it reach 111 on the lcd screen. then change the lcd back to 110 and it immediately starts printing. 

running the pid auto-tune and feeding those values in has the same effect. i have auto tuned several times, each one giving slightly different result but in every case i end up a few 10ths short of desired temp even thought the lcd says 110."
leveling help for taz 5,so i recently got a taz 5 and after a few prints about all the small prints where coming out well until i decided to start doing larger prints. what i have notices is the extruder lifts slightly as it moves closer to the filament side as if the possibly uneven. i have been trying to tweak it for some time now. i have even picked up a level to make it perfect. when i hit home the z axis is just about to touch the glass then when i move the x axis to the other side i notice at least a couple mm lift. i am not sure where i am going wrong in calibrating.,"geburges wrote:sounds like one of your z steppers got out of sync.  to correct, set the print head at operating height with x=0 (the left side when looking at the printer from the front).  i use a piece of paper as my ""feeler"" gauge.  make sure the stepper motors are off and move the print head to the right side of the print surface.  now, turn the left side z threaded rod to adjust the height of the print head.  use should now move the print head back to the right side and verify that the right side is still the correct height.  (you may need to repeat this process several times if the printer is really out of tune.)

i hope this helps.  i know how frustrating it can be trying to get things working right.

if inread this correctly,you are just setting your x axis to be parallel to your bed, which may or may not be orthogonal to the z axis.  the proper way to level the x axis is to measure using a vernier caliper from the aluminum bed mount to the bottom bar of the x axis on both side then make them even.  once the x axis is orthogonal to this plate, you can begin leveling the  bed.  preheat bed and nozzle, position nozzle at about 30,30 (bed back, nozzle left) and be sure the bed height adjustment screw (one with spring) is about in the middle of its adjustment.  set the height using the z endstop by slowly lowering it until you feel resistance using a piece of paper as a feeler.  move nozzle to other 3 corners and level using the leveling screw not z endstop. once all 4 are levelled, check them all again."
flexistruder question,"i'm new to printing and the ninjaflex seems like a pretty exciting filament. i have a few questions regarding the flexistruder tool heads.

1. does the flexistruder print standard non-flexible filament well?

2. if so - why isn't the flexistruder standard on the taz 5? as i understand it, the main difference is how the filament is fed (clearances).

i get that the stock tool head can handle ninjaflex albeit poorly.

3. how much does it cost to build your own flexistruder vs ordering one from lulzbot? i haven't seen many threads on here of people rolling their own. i'm not sure if that is because it's a given and everyone does it - or if there is something stopping from people doing it.

4. could i cannibalize my stock tool head, print my own parts and upgrade (assuming the flexistruder can handle non-flexible filaments equally as well to the stock)?


these questions might be a little advanced for my current knowledge - i'm still learning the basics - just trying to look ahead.

ideally, i'd love to print my own dual extruder tool head.","hi, i have similar questions about flexystruder, here are *official* answers from lulzbot sales representative :

do you mean the flexystruder is only for flexible filament, and i have to switch with the original extruder each time i change filament type ?
the flexystruder is designed to handle only flexible materials and you'll have to swap back to the stock extruder if you want to print with stiff materials.

there is currently no fdm 3d printer that has a stock nozzle that can handle both.
i saw a great thing with it is to print different filament type (abs/hips for complex model support, or abs/flex for wheel). does the dual flexystruder support those combinations, or simply 2 different colors of pla or abs ? 
we have two dual extruders the dual extruder and the flexy dually. unfortunately the version 1 is currently out of stock while we are just about to start assembly of version 2, which should become available within a few weeks.

the dual extruder will handle either 2 different colors of the same stiff material or 2 totally different stiff materials (all the same materials as your stock extruder: abs, pla, hips, nylons, t-glase, metal infused, wood infused, polycarbonate etc).

the flexy dually will hand 1 type of flexible with 1 type of stiff material. you could do something like a bike handle make of polycarbonate wrapped with a ninjaflex grip. 
i think the day i will upgrade, i'll choose dual flexystruder, like that i could print :
- 'solid' filament
- flexible filament
- dual solid and flexible filament

the only thing i'll can't do is dual solid filament, or i'll have to buy both dual extruder... right ? 
ya you can use the extruders by themselves if you get a flexy dually. that'll give you the most versatility. and correct, you'll still be unable to do two stiff materials. 
and what about the future taz 6, will it support solid and flexible filament, built-in ? 
it's unlikely the taz will have that difference but you can follow its development here: https://devel.lulzbot.com/taz/mangrove [1] [1]/
the taz 6 or 'taz pro' which may be its name is internally called the mangrove.
the big change will be the bed leveling and bringing the power supply into the electronics box. we'll provide upgrade kits for a taz 5 so you don't need to wait. 
the capability to print stiff and flexible material with the same head is really a missing feature, i hope you will do a
'universal' extruder some day, it would be amazing. 
oh i agree.  i think if there was an extruder we could make we would.  remember, because it's all open source everyone with a 3d
printer can use our files as blueprints to develop new extruders. the dual extruder was a customer's design!  hopefully someone will figure it out how to deal with both. 

hope it can help !"
ticking noise somewhere on the y axis,"hi everyone,
i'm hunting a short, sharp ticking (or clicking) noise without success in the last days. it sounds comparable to a hot exhaust system on a motorbike when it's cooling down. anybody has an idea which part could be responsible?
what i know about it:
.) occours repeatable during all steady moves of the y-axis, but not on fast travel moves
.) happens 1 per y-stepper revolution
.) source must be somewhere under the print bed, not from stepper itself or the bearing on the other end of the belt.
.) doesn't affect print quality

i can't find anything, the belt runs free, no wires interacting with it. rods and bushings are looking good as far as i can tell without disasembling the hole thing. no visible cracks in the parts..","so, now i did what i wanted to avoid: removed the y frame.. then i recognised that the sound has to come from the stepper, it seems to come from the bed because the belt transfered it to the aluminum plate.
i removed the pulley from the stepper, first because i thought it might have a crack (thinking on the thread with the cracked z coupler). couldn't find anything, stepper turns just fine. now everything is back in place, no ticking up to now.. let's see if it comes back when printing tomorow."
dual extruder is garbage.,"last month i finally got around to installing ny dual extruder. 

so far i have successfully completed 0 dual extruder prints. 

i have completed 0 prints using one of the two extruders individually. 

this (attached image) happens every time. 

there are no fans on the dual extruder. and heat creep has been a major issue, so i found a dual fan thing on thingiverse and put it in. 

only to find there is no way of programming the second fan!

the firmware is garbage as well. 

for most dual prints i tried, after the first layer nozzle one suddenly stops dropping in temperature.  according to the lcd the temp was set at 210, but the nozzle was at 165 and dropping when i caught it. setting the temp to 0, then back to 210 solves the issue. 

so i continue printing. then all the sudden i notice its jammed. best creep has bonded the pla to the assembly as shown in the picture. (this is the 3rd time!) then i notice the fan has stopped. i scan through my gcode only to find nothing that stops the fan. it should still be running 100% 

i can honestly say this is the worst 500$ i have ever spent. i've had this thing a few months now and its too late to send it back. 

save yourselves the headache and don't buy the dual extruder. it blows.  ","i don't have a dual extruder setup so i can't commiserate.  lulzbot probably wouldn't continue to sell the dual extruder if it wasn't performing to par.  have you tried contacting support?  they seem pretty good with helping folks.  

would also help if you posted the software you're using to slice the project and control the printer.  

the loss of temp in the second nozzle seems strange, usually its frustrations with leveling the two nozzles... but it doesn't sound like you've gotten to that stage of pulling hair out.   "
jerky/stalled motor (taz 4),so i just replaced all my rods with hardened steel rods along with linear ball bearings. i went to test my printer but the left z-axis motor (near the power supply) won't turn. it is making the noise like it is trying to turn but is getting stuck. i unplugged the right z-axis motor and the left motor turned normally. when the right motor is plugged in again the problem re-occurs. what can cause this?,"nbmoretto wrote: what can cause this?

the distance of the backend of the x-ends plates on the x rods. the end plates are acting as a lever on the bearings, and if you apply too much force the bearing will not slide. adjusting them(distance of the two x rods) in and out until you find the 'happy' point. they also need to be evenly spaced or you will put a twist on the x end plate top to bottom.

note: make sure you have free travel all the way from the top of the z rods down to the bed plate.

or at least that is how i have fixed it so far when i have it. ymmv."
flexystruder 2 voltage requirements,i'm looking at getting one of the flexystruder 2's (https://www.lulzbot.com/products/lulzbo ... ol-head-v2) to hack onto my prusa i3 and need to know if it requires 12v or 24v for the heating element.,"appreciate the answers...

i broke down last night and ordered a taz5 and flexystruder, so no hacking will happen... for now.

assuming it's as good for printing ninjaflex as i expect i'll be buying another one to hack onto my prusa, but i'll go ahead and upgrade it to 24v at the same time since it's been on my to-do list.  the print bed is 12/24v and takes forever to get to abs temps as it is."
taz 5 help,"greetings 

i recently got the taz 5 3d printer and had it worked wonderfully the first week but now i am running into a bit of a problem.

when i start a print the printer wont extrude the filliment and it seems like it is getting stuck and the wheel that feeds the hotend but if i stop the printer and manually extrude the filliment though cura controle center it works fine, i have taken the tool head off and cleaned the feeding wheel but with out success

any ideas ?

best regards jóhannes from iceland ","sometimes the small setscrew in the small gear comes loose after shipping. check that it is down and tight and lined up with the flat spot on the motor shaft. also make sure there is approximately 8mm between the two metal washers on either side of the spring that is on both idler latch tension bolts. 

you may also have your nozzle too close to the bed for it to extrude. if you hear a scrapping clicking noise that's probably it. use the z height endstop target adjustment screw to move the nozzle a little further from the bed."
adeshion troubles,"i have a taz4 with its own extruder. since sunday, i started to have severe adhesion troubles: soon after extruding the skirt, filament doesn't attach to the bed as you can see in the pics. i've already leveled the bed buit never changed. any idea?


","franz wrote:you mean the black screw on the printer's left side or the slicer settings?

that is the z-end stop adjustment screw. the slicer settings would be z height. the screw is the 'do not pass this point' setting for head movement. i believe the firmware will try to prevent movement past the end stop triggering."
is anyone a bit frustrated buy this?,"i ordered my taz 5 back in april of this year.  i decided to go with the taz 5 based on many factors. one major factor being that they said they would have the new dual head completed and ready to ship with in a few weeks (i think they said around 2 months) of my purchase date. i wanted & need a dual head printer to spam the use of my stratasys dimension sst1200 es.  still waiting!  this sucks!  i now have a project i need the dual head and i'm stuck with single head printing.  no i don't want to use the older dual head they have available now.  i was told by them the new one would be all metal hot end.  

im pissed!!  anyone else????      

sorry to rag, i do like the taz 5, very happy with it but really pissed about the dual head situation.",it is frustrating but i am much more satisfied knowing they are testing it and making changes to release a good product rather than just throwing something out there that i am going to have problems with. when you are spending about $500 on a add-on you expect it to work well. so in that case i am happy waiting.
what makes the taz5 so much better than the mini?,"i'm the proud owner of a new mini.  i chose it based on the price compared to the taz 5.

i have to know, what makes the taz 5 worth so much more?

the only real difference i've seen is available print volume, and sd card usability.

this is not a troll, i simply want to know as i'm looking at building a 2nd printer using my mini.

cheers!","mainly it is the build area.  the taz 5 is a bit less ""friendly"" for lack of a better word.  out of the box it is lacking the auto leveling bed but auto bed compensation can be added.  the extruders are virtually identical though."
x-axis going out of level,"i am currently facing an issue during printing where the x-axis goes out of level after a while i.e. measuring the distance from the bottom of the x axis smooth rod and the top surface of the y axis aluminum bed plate. i noticed while printing halfway, the left z-axis motor stopped moving while the right z-axis motor continued to move and the x-axis went extremely out of level of about more than 1cm. this flattened the z-axis of the print basically as the left side was not able to move.

i did some troubleshooting and realised the left motor turns with more resistance than the right motor and suspected too much friction in the left threaded rod at the top and bottom bearings. i oiled the parts and the threaded rod rod turned a bit better this time. thereafter i ran cura and did increments of 0.1mm to simulate a print going on and realised after doing like 20 to 30 times the x-axis still goes off by about 1-2mm after leveling it. 

any ideas on how to fix this or suggestions as to what is going on? thanks!","check the motor coupler set screws on whichever motor isn't turning, it can sometimes come loose and then turn, but not actually engage the leadscrew on one side. also check for loose connections. 

if it ins't that, it could be that you just don't have the x axis paralelle at start. if it is off even a few threads, the excess friction binds and then causes one side to stick. in your case, i would start by removing the x axis belt, carriage and smooth rods and then make sure each individual x axis end assembly runs up and down the leadscrew smoothly without binding. then home the z axis and reset both leadscrews so that the distance from the top of the lower motor leadscrew support bearing to the bottom of the z nut itself is identical on both sides. then reinstall the x carriage rods, and belt and try it again. 

if it's binding, something is loose or off."
frequent nozzle change (.35-.50) and bed leveling,"i'm interested in other peoples experiences. i frequently change nozzle sizes between my .35 and .5 nozzle due to different types of models and resolution that i want to print at.  for the longest time when i would switch my nozzle i wouldn't think about leveling the bed. i always thought of those as separate activities. in fact, truth be told, i mostly thought of bed leveling as making sure that there was no *tilt* to the bed. yes, i knew that the nozzle needs to be a certain height off of the bed but for whatever reason i never correlated that when changing nozzles.

periodically i would raise and lower the bed using the stock bed leveling file provided by lulzbot.  so, coincidently when i would have my .35 nozzle on and i set the bed height correctly i had really great prints including prints that did not stick as dramatically to the bed as other times which always seemed to puzzle me. then if i would switch to my .5 nozzle and not address the level (meaning it was still set for the .35 nozzle), i was continually baffled by the fact that the bases of my prints seems to always be flared out (as if the bed was too hot and the lower few mm were sinking into it) and those prints felt like they were super glued to the bed.

of course now, i feel a bit like an idiot for not ever putting that together in my head.  so i wanted to share my experience in the event that it may help some of you if you happen to switch nozzles with any frequency or even if it helps you mentally separate the 'tilt' aspect of bed leveling from the 'height' aspect.  i'm now so 'in tune' with my printer that i can swap the nozzle, make a quick half turn on all corner bed screws, start the bed level file while making subtle adjustments as the head moves across the bed all in about 3 minutes.

z axis 1605 x 450mm ballscrew conversion,"i found a pair of 16mm x 450mm ballscrews on ebay for $130. these were machined with 8mm motor connectors and 12mm bearing steps, and came with 8mmx8mm motor connectors, and 12mm bearing endblocks, pretty much all the hadware needed. they took  a couple of weeks to get from china, but the price is good.

attached are some pictures of my conversion. this turned out to be very simple after a few false starts. i designed bearing holders in freecad that are just 28.05 and 26.05 cylinders cut out of 30mm and 28 mm cylinders. the inner cylinders are at x=0,y=0,z=2, and the outer ones at 0,0,0, a third cylinder 22mm in diameter, at 0,0,0, cuts a hole in the center, leaving very nice bearing holders. the bearing snap into these and the holders fit into the existing holes in the z top and bottom brackets. pretty cool, huh? peircet probably thought of it first:)

the exisiting z nut is replaced by the ballscrews, and a printed adapter sits on top of it to attach the metal x axis bracket. i did need to trim the  bracket and the bearing holder for the support rod for clearance, but no major surgery was needed. i think i could even get rid of the support rod the ballscrew shafts are so sturdy.

the only tricky part was how to attach the motors 5mm shafts to the 8mm coupler. i just happened to have some aluminum tubing with about 1mm walls, so i cut a short section, cut a slot down one side, and pressed it over the motor shaft. that took care of the motor coupler.

all that was left was firmware changes to handle the different pitch on the new screws. the stock leadscrews have a 2mm pitch, these are 5mm, so 1600 x 2/5  = 640. you can change that in the configuration menu, or in configuration.h in the firmware. be siure to change the z axis and not the extruder settings, or weird things happen.","images

operation is very smooth with no wobble or backlash issues. the ballscrews worked very well before the fire ....... see my safety post for details on that. anyone need a ballscrew modified taz, slightly charred?

help a newbie with his 1st 3d printer,"so i've recently been working with a taz 5 and it's been a little journey, right now, my big question for the community is that i need help with figuring out how to make my prints smoother. like i have had little success printing things that aren't either brittle or stringy (i expected the stringy prints were because i was using 1.75mm filament and that made the figure look bad.) so after switching to 3mm filament i've been getting somewhat better first layers but then i get issues like: 
yes this is the 20mm calibration cube.

ironically the one messed up side is the one closest to the fan so i want to say that it could be the fan causing it so i'm just really wondering what i could do to fix up or help get better prints.

attached is the specs in lulzbot cura that i had while running the cube.","what type of filament are you using?

are you using the downloaded taz version of cura if so all you need to do (maybe) is change the nozzle size. i would highly recommend using the quick print settings regardless of what you read here they work fine. once you get the z height switch properly adjusted that's all you need to do. i owned two taz machines and aside from changing the temperature of bed and nozzle i did nothing else and i got good results."
"dual extruder - prints extra ""block tower""","i don't know if this is a software (cura) or hardware (taz 4) or  firmware issue or ?... 
i just updated to have a dual head extruder on our lulzbot taz 4.  i have downloaded a few different dual extruder objects from thingaverse and then tried printing them.  they print okay, but each print also adds a square tower beside the print object.  it is the same height and it is made up of alternating layers of from the two print heads.  the ""tower block"" is not visible on cura.

it seems to be a waste of filament and time ...

any ideas where this ""block tower"" is coming from and how to stop it from happening?
thank you.","nice find! you use the priming tower as your second head will remain heated when not in use. this can lead to dripping, causing air gaps in the hot end when the second extruder is used. the priming tower just gets things flowing so you do not have these gaps in your actual print. you can adjust the size of the priming tower in the expert options.

i have found the ooze shield to be the most helpful option. this will build up a single pass wall the height of your object. this will wipe off the extruders preventing any ""hairs"" from accumulating on the object."

apologies if this is somewhere else in the forum, but i couldn't find it.","yes, at some point we may have more taz 4/5 control box wiring harness bits to sell.  you can get away with using a taz 4/5 control box and running your taz 3 harnesses out the holes, but some need to be lengthened and some shortened.  to do it ""right"" gets expensive, as the connecters alone add up quickly.

is there demand for a ~$300 ""upgrade a taz 3 to taz 5"" control box and wiring harnesses kit?

list of items that wear out,"i bought a used taz 5 and i've had a great time calibrating and tuning all the things. however, i can't shake this feeling that there will be components on the printer that wear out, or could already be wore out. maybe a gear, maybe a belt, or something... i've read the lulz documentation and read about bushings and lithium grease. however, i haven't seen a good checklist going through the components checking for health. has anyone written anything like that? is there a list of parts that will wear out with heavy use and a way to do a health check on the components? i'm looking for photos of worn out extruder gears, broken parts, worn or mis-tensioned belts, common warrantied items, etc.

am i being a 3d-printer-hypochondriac?","small extruder gear is the most likely wear point. large extruder gear after that. then the extruder 608zz bearings, though the taz 4 and newer used sealed bearings there so they last longer. the igus bushings will wear after heavy use, if you have carriage or bed play on the rails it may be time to think about replacing some or all of those. the belts should not wear out during the expected lifespan of the printer itself unless they are wearing on something. the extruder idler latch and extruder body can occasionally wear out as well, but thats rare. 

fuses, heater cores and thermistors are good to keep around but do not need replacing until an issue occurs. 

lucas oil white lithium grease goes on the leadscrews as needed, no lubrication on the bearing rods since the igus bushings are self lubricating. 

everything else should be fine. most failures of parts aside from the gears can be made to work long enough to print a replacement. it's never a bad idea to tune your 3d printer though. welcome to the taz club!"
taz 5 pla random clogging issues and a solution.,"good afternoon all!  

i've been reading (and reading, and reading...) lots of threads about random clogging, failed prints, and just plain old weirdness when printing with the taz 5 / hexagon hotend.  as i've had to work through these same issues with my own taz 5, i'd like to share my solution.  

2 things to note before i begin the enormous ""wall of text""..  first, i want to thank ray at lulzbot tech support for an extremely long support call to help me understand the specifics of how the extrusion process works, and why each component is there (the manufacturers' design).  second, i'd like to apologize for the length of this post - it will be a long read, but hopefully a worthwhile one!

---  the problem  ---

very much like all of the other posts regarding the taz 5 / hexagon hotend / pla issues, i've had a lot of failed prints due to ""heat creep"".  i've been through the joys of pulling the nozzle up to 4 times in one day to clean it out.  i've tried scraping, polishing, using precision sized drills / reamers followed up with acetone washes and more polishing.  basically, what it all came down to was a repeated ""i got it this time!"", and then after 1-4 hours of printing, it would clog, or just stop printing again.  i say 'it would stop printing again', because i finally got tired of cleaning out clogs, so i cranked the hotend up to 270°c, and extruded 100mm of filament.  yes, 270°c.  i know, i know, but i was frustrated!  i had so many prints that looked like this:






after this particular print, i did a 140° cold pull.  this is what it looked like:






when i saw this cold pull, i picked up the phone and had that awesome conversation with ray from taz tech support.   we both agreed that i was the victim of heat creep, which really should have been avoidable.  but from what i'm reading on these forums, i'd bet that there are a good many of you falling victim to the same issue.  personally, i'm a 'little' stubborn sometimes, and i have a need to make things work.  so here i am thinking - ""i have a heat issue.  i'm gonna fix this once, and be done.""  what did i do?  i took an 80mm fan from one of my computers, along with the power supply, i cut an old cd in half, and i literally double sticky taped the thing on the front of my extruder assembly.  i used the pieces of the cd to direct the fan air flow to the cooling fins of the extruder, while isolating the hotend itself.  here's 2 pictures from my hacker ""wall of shame"":











it wasn't pretty.  i had a lot of zip ties holding things out of the way.  and i had a pc power supply hanging from the back of my taz frame... but it worked.  i was able to dial in my first layer to be within .01mm every time, with what i felt was near perfect results (fill, overlap, etc..)







---  the solution  ---

after printing various parts - keeping my printer running for 4 days straight, i felt it was time to put a real fix in place.  i used the cad files supplied to us with our taz 5 to design a fan shroud and filament tube retainer that will provide an excellent amount of cooling for not only the hotend cooling fins, but also the entire filament feed assembly.  the filament tube retainer provides some additional support for the feed tube, but also helps to line up the filament as it heads into the hobbed bolt.  the feed tube holder is a modified version of http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:766614 created by wolfie.  the fan shroud is my original creation.  i don't have a thingiverse account set up yet, but i'm more than happy to share the file(s) if anyone wants them.  here's the thread with details on the fan shroud - taz 5 80mm fan shroud 

here's a picture of it:






(additional pictures in a following post)

figuring this out took a lot.  anyone that has struggled with it understands how frustrating it can be.  i've done 2 12+ hour pla prints, with no problems at all now, and i'm using z hop as well as retract excessively to push the limits on my testing (using cura).  

hopefully this will help you out if you're having pla issues with your taz 5. ","this post made us realize that the enclosure we made for the taz 5 to elevate temperature and eliminate random air flow works great for abs, but the 'heat creep' from the warm environment is causing filament jams in the hexagon cooling fin area when running pla.  thanks for the insight.  will vent enclosure to get internal temperature close to room temperature when running pla and move the filament roll out of the enclosure.  will probably add a bigger cooling fan for the hexagon fin area.....  thanks again.."
new taz user,"hello,

this is my first venture in 3d printing. i just got a taz 5, super neat.

so after scouring the web and getting a lot of the fine tuning resolved theres one thing i cant quite figure out. a few first test items i made are keychains for my wife. the top layer seems to be a little..off... the infill section is raised and bumpy. the layering of the sides of the print a perfectly stacked and look really nice. so im not sure why the top after it infills the middle with structure it cant make the top layer lines run parallel. cura wants to keep hatching it seems like. ive tried 20% infill and 100% infill and they both look the same. im using lulz pla plastic, 205 c hotend, 60 c bed temp. speed doesnt seem to matter. i did two versions one at 50 and one at 10 and they are identical. attached some pics. thanks for suggestions.



","if the top layer is bumpy and it looks like the nozzle is dragging through the previously deposited plastic, you are probably over extruding a little. make sure you measure the actual diameter of the filament you are printing with and enter that value in your slicer.

it the filament diameter is correct in the slicer, adjust the extrusion multiplier to something less than 100% in your slicer. 97% is a good place to start. adjust until you get a nice flat top surface.

auto bed leveling,"hello everyone,

first let me apologize, i know that a lot of people have asked about bed leveling and that there is quite a bit of stuff on the forums about it.

does anyone know of a way that i could fairly easily (as easy as a mod can be i guess) add automatic bed leveling to my taz 5? it just takes me soooo long to get my bed good and leveled and inevitably i always have to end up leveling again after so many prints. i really would like to let the printer compensate on its own. what would i need? i see stuff about lasers, and capacitive sensors, etc etc. and once i figure out what i would like to use, how would i go about hooking it up? i really don't wanna fry my printer's brain.

thanks for any help,

new taz 4 bed questions,"hi all,

just bought an unloved taz4, i've managed to get the rambo board installed and it's now working again   

none of the parts that hold the heated bed came with it, i've managed to tape the bed down and print out the finger and bed corners but i'm now struggling to understand how it all goes together. from what i can gather, there are 2 fixings that hold the corner onto the aluminium plate. one is an m3 bolt (with a spring) and the other appears to be some kind of standoff. i've tried a couple of combinations but it's not really working. does anyone have any details on what the standoff is, i've searched the bom and all documents i can find but with no joy?

flexydually vs taz dual,"what is difference between  flexydually vs taz dual? i understand that flexy can do flex martial,
is there something dual head can do vs flexydually?
also are those v2 heads for either dual or flexydually?","i was told as recent as today that the flexydually (flexy side) sound not run anything but flexible filament. i have read other posting that make it sound like you can run the same filaments (abs, hips, etc) with the exception that the tube will wear out faster. 

however i am unable to get these filaments to extrude without cause the stepper motor to jitter and pause every few mm's.  i am also having issues getting the ninjaflex filament to extrude a consistent amount. when i emailed support, the reply was not to use anything but flex filament in the flexstruder."
different z heights with different extruders,"good morning folks... so i own a taz 5 and a couple of extruders.
of course i leveled my bed and set up all of my printing profiles with the stock extruder.
now with my 2nd extruder i am .6mm lower to the bed than with the stock.
this is a lulzbot branded (they made it) extruder and there is nearly a mm of difference between the z height of the stock, and this one.
is this something that others see? is it just a ""deal with it"" situation?
i have to admit, having 2 profiles for every filament, every variation is a gigantic pain in the butt.. luckily s3d has the easy offset mode, which does make it a bit easier. however, each time it runs the home z to start a print, it pushes .6mm in to the glass, which is less than ideal.
thoughts?
thanks","are all the hotends the same make (ie, hexagon ao)?  try adjusting the heatbreak... when you buy the hexagon kits, they come with a small wrench which fits the tube between the heater and heatsink.  if the tube doesn't adjust, there seems to be a brass insert accessible from the top of the hotend... its possible that the heat break butts against the insert.  adjusting the insert may allow for similar adjustments to the heat break / heater.

if you're using an e3d or regular hexagon, then an adjustable mounting plate or shims would be a great idea."
stepper motor cooling on taz5,"i've discovered that to keep using my printer in my non-air-conditioned garage during the day i need to do some active cooling of some kind on my stepper motors (mostly the x and y).  i've got it indoors right now and found that a largish heatsink can bring the x stepper down by 10c without a fan.  i'm thinking of grabbing some gpu replacement heatsink/fans since they look like they'll match in size to the steppers pretty well.

does anyone have any experience doing this, and if so is there a better way?  this is happening because in the garage at times it can get to 45c ambient and the steppers around 70-75c after running a while.  i've also thought about water cooling the x, y and z steppers (too difficult to do the e stepper) to try to improve the situation too if this isn't enough.

http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/b00nq8jcv6/ this is what i'm thinking of.  i'm thinking either i'll print up some kind of mount or i'll end up gluing it in place with some silver thermal adhesive i've got for putting heatsinks on to-220 packages but only as a last resort because that stuff doesn't come off.","these steppers are quite capable of handling heat, on the other hand you may get a bit more longevity from the nema's by cooling.....especially if you do an industrial amount of printing. other than that they only cost around $20 and i don't think the sag is worth a heat sink on the horizontal axis. there are a few posts on sag in this forum already."
print quality after layer >~6,"i'm a new owner of a taz 5, 0.35mm extruder. here's a photo of a print i'm having random success with. material is pla. slicing with simplify3d, medium, 3mm filament set to 2.9mm based on averaged caliper measurement. rectilinear infill both internal and external. lots of settings... don't know where to focus my testing.

thanks for your ideas!




","i installed the new 0.5mm hot end and printed using the lulz cura. i'm still having the same problem after 2-5 layers. it almost seems like the z-axis isn't moving high enough to accommodate the next layer. the nozzle rubs on the previous layer(s) and starts smearing. on my small pi print (above) it happened at the very top layer (shell?). on rocktopous it happened right away on layer 3 around 2mm high. however, it's not precisely repeatable... i'm trying to minimize variables between prints, but the rocktopus takes 37 minutes to print vs. the pi symbol's 5 minute prints. quicker iterations on the pi.

anyways, on the latest rocktopus it seems like the nozzle was rubbing into the previous layer. settings were: standard speed. layer height .25mm, 1mm bottom/top thickness, 50 mm/s print speed. printing temp/bed temp are 0, so that must inherit from the printer, which is 205c and 60c. the pla i'm using is velleman from microcenter. label says 190c-225c print temps.

extra part after reassembly,"ah, yes, the dreaded leftover part after reassembly.

","that extra square block is the retention plate for the heater cartridge and thermistor. it is confusing, as in your photo i can see yours is successfully installed. i suspect it came off of your old hot end, and you can see where it would go under the install retention plate step here: https://ohai-kit.alephobjects.com/proje ... 08d914c68/

dual extruder mechanical issue,"my brand new dual extruder after just a few prints has a warped flex plate (ironic isn't it). it's warped so much the two large gear nuts were rubbing together.

this plate either has to be stiffened up or made out of something like pc.

does anyone have the solid model of the flex plate from the dual extruder? i can only find the stl

is lulzbot aware of this issue? bottom line is the flex point is too stiff in comparison to the rest of the flex plate. so when i leveled the two nozzles, the wrong part of the flex plate bent. it's either this or it warped from the heat.","i had been running a lulz dual extruder for quite a long time, had no issues with the flex plate warping.

i did, however, have issues with the design as a whole (that thing is heavy and puts a lot of wobble everywhere!) so i ended up moving to an e3d chimera.  for a short while i was running it as a bowden, but now my fancy-shmancy servo extruder has arrived, and it looks like this:






getting it running smoothly was... not easy. lots of firmware hacking, running some extra cables, a step down voltage convertor, etc etc. but, i can run two extruders with a single stepper motor! the servo acts kind of like a car transmission, shifting the motor between two gears. the mount i designed is also rigid as hell, and since everything is very, very close to the smooth rods there's not much flex (if any).  

the extruder is the hpx2-max by dglass3d.  for the moment, i can't really recommend it unless you like a challenge - there's almost no documentation on it at all yet, and the modified firmware they use is either much older, or much newer than the taz firmware - i had to tweak a lot of stuff to get it running nicely. the dglass guys are relatively good with information, but all my communications with them suffered a lot of delays.  basically, very nice product, but they need a lot of work on the support side."
stepper motors in enclosure?,"i played around with hot boxing my printer during some large prints. i found that the enclosure did not really help with the print lifting/warping but i hope it is because enclosure was makeshift (honestly i'm still having a hard time getting large prints to stick at the corners, even with brim). 

during my experiments i found that the stepper motors became ridiculously hot to touch. i burnt my hand. is this ok for them? are they designed to handle the extra heat of an enclosure? i know a lot of people build enclosures, has anyone had any issues with the stepper motors in them?

i know i need to vent the electrical box or install it on the outside of the enclosure. i was leaning towards moving it to the outside of the enclosure but this becomes a pain if i ever needed to remove the enclosure, i may end up just venting it instead.","stepper motors can handle alot of heat. the bearings can eventually fail somewhat quicker than they would otherwise in those conditions, and the plastic mounts the motors are attached to should be a concern since they might melt, but otherwise the motors are probably going to be ok, and if they aren't they are fairly inexpensive to replace. you can plaster the outside with tons of heatsyncs if it will help. 

the electronics and the stepper controllers are an entirely different issue. if those get too warm you will get wierd jerky prints and melted expensive components."
hotend heating issue : taz4 + e3d v6,"i've been noticing recently that my hot end (e3dv6) on my taz 4 is having a really hard time keeping the temp up. things like fast extrusion and fan turning on literally sap the heat away, and while printing i'll watch the temp slowly drop down.

this is strange because it will heat up to target temps, and if i slow things down or turn off fan it starts climbing back up to target temp.
it's almost like the heater is not strong enough to overcome heat dissipation in normal use... 

the funny thing is, when i run pid autotune the reported temp shoots up 2-3 times faster, just like it did when i first installed it. however once i set pid and try a normal warmup, it's back to it's slow, lethargic warm up speeds and performance.

what gives?
it can heat up fast enough, but something seems to be limiting it during normal use? any ideas?

 things i've tried:
- setting pid to various things, running autotune
- setting thermistor to 5 in firmware
- setting max pid to 255 in firmware for higher current

taz 4.5 print quality issue,"i've got an issue affecting my last dozen prints that i haven't been able to figure out.

the photos will serve as the best description. it seems as if each layer, starting about 1cm off of the pei surface, is offset 3mm or so in either direction in an alternating fashion. by that i mean that it looks like layer 41 is printed at a y offset of 3mm and layer 42 is printed with a -3mm y offset. strangely this only occurs on the ""lower"" half of the build area – lower meaning from y0 to around y130.

note that the photos depict a single part, not two. you can see how the issue is only affecting part of the print area.
















this is the part shown:






what i've tried:

 ensuring that the two cables running to the build surface are moving freely and not snagging
 checking to make sure all belts and bushings are moving smoothly
 made sure the nozzle is not clogged

thanks","since the piece next to it looks ok, its probably not belts or pulley,  but check those anyways. a loose pulley setscrew can produce strange motion.

"taz 5 print failing, what's wrong???","we are printing a very large print with support. the walls are not very thick. it is a mask that covers the persons whole head. the first time we printed this, it had the same separation, but was a lot worse and didn't make it as far. this time we changed the print head temperature to extrude hotter (from 250 to 260), but had a similar result. 

what is the issue? this mask needs to be printed in one piece (as customer requested). we are printing in abs and upped the temperature to 260 and print bed at 110.","i agree with the other posters. it is splitting due to large changes in temperature. put a box over your printer. when i did this, my splitting problems all but went away. for the few times i had very minor splits, i made abs slurry and filled the crack and sanded it smooth. then i vapor polished the entire part.

thick walls will tend to do this. thick walls tend to store heat and if the heat is removed quickly, the part will begin to warp. enough warping stress will cause some of the layers to delaminate.

i've also found that thinner layers tend to help prevent this since you get a bit better adhesion between layers. the downside being longer print times.

taz5 mimicking printing,"about a month ago i had purchased a taz 5 and at first it was printing fine, but now it appears as though it is fake printing some layers. the print will start off okay, but a few layers in the tip will stop extruding and it will continue to operate normally  as though it is actually extruding the filament. a few seconds latter it will begin extruding again, but since it missed a layer in a certain spot the filament will not lay. i have tested this with different models to make sure it was not the model's fault, but it keeps happening no mater what model i use. i am very new to using a 3d printer so any suggestions are welcome. i use a taz lulzbot 5, sli3er and cura. thank you.","there are a couple of things that could cause this. usually when the extruder stops extruding, it grinds a hole in the filiment, and it won't restart without intervention. i think to mark the filiment as it goes in to the extruder with a magic marker so i can see that its still feeding the filiment.  check the fan that blows on the hexagon part of the hot end. this is a very necessary part of the hot end, and causes all kinds of issues if heat is allowed to melt the plastic way up in the hexagon part. maybe tighten the thumb screws a couple of turns to get more force on the feeder. about 10mm of space between the extruder body and bottom of the screw is about right. try slowing down the printing speed and see if that has any effect. make sure the filiment can feed smoothly from the spool. ive had many prints ruined because of a tangle at the spool. if you can identify conditions where extruding  stops that would help diagnose the issue."
taz 4 clogging issues with pla,"hi
i have a taz 4 and i've been having issues with pla clogging in the extruder. i have cleaned the nozzle several times. have heated up to 230 in order to extrude any possible remains of abs although it's been months since i last used abs.
the problem is persistent in big prints. prints that take 1 to 1.5 hours are just fine... but above that and usually around 2 hours start the problems. twice that i have disassembled the extruded i've noticed that the filament seems to be stuck at at the top of the cooling rings above the extruder. my guess is that because the pla we are using is at 200c the temperature builds up at the cooling rings and above causing the filament to expand and so causing the clogging. i know that one solution would be to buy the lulzbot pla which works at lower temperature and we had that working fine. but are there any suggestions/solutions to solve this? anyone else experienced this?
i even installed a second fan to blow air to the cooling rings but even that didn't solve the problem. it's really annoying since my taz 4 is kind of useless if i can only print small prints.
any help is much appreciated","take a hard look at the plastic as it exits the nozzle. does it curl at all when it comes out? it should drop straight down out of the nozzle. grab a piece of the extruded plastic and pull it between your fingertips and fingernails. it should be nice and smooth. 

if the plastic curls or you feel roughness on the extruded plastic, you still have some sort of obstruction in the orifice. 

have you tried doing cold pulls? heat the hotend to printing temps and extrude some plastic. cool the hotend and pull the filament out of the extruder. you will have to experiment with the temperature but when you get it right, the plastic will pull out all the way down to the orifice.

also, make sure you have the tension on your hobbed bolt idler high enough. pla is harder than abs and i get better results higher pressure on the hobbed bolt. 

as a last resort, you can remove the nozzle and soak in in scigrip 4 10308 acrylic solvent. 

i have successfully cleaned several nozzles with that solvent."
enclosure design - $300 - looking for feedback/ideas,"hey everybody.  so i've been wanting an enclosure for a while, but have been putting it off for different reasons.  primary reason was that i didn't want to pay for it.  however i've decided to go for it and have put together a preliminary design that i'm hoping you can help me review.  a few notes:
1) i plan to duct the enclosure box or mount it flush to the side panel, but haven't yet decided which route to take.
2) filament will be mounted inside the enclosure, between the top rails.  i made this mount (total overkill) which i'm very happy with, but am going to make a new one that mounts the same way but moves the spool about 4 inches lower.  i have not needed the full build height yet. http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:725128
3) i need to add holes in the back for cables.  i'm deciding what the best way to do this is.
4) i need to add cam latches to keep the door closed, but i'll design and print these myself.
5) i'm thinking i'll probably use a 3/4"" strip of adhesive backed felt to make the door close quietly and create a nice seal.
6) i've had led strips for about 8 months to add lighting, but haven't gotten around to installing it yet.
7) enclosure is primarily for noise and to protect from drafts.  i live in an old, small, drafty apartment, and my printer lives in the living room.  fortunately heat is free and abundantly available.

price breakdown:
30mm square aluminum extrusion: $93
3pc 1/4"" baltic birch plywood, 30""x60"": $60
cost to laser cut plywood: quote in progress, but i can buy a 5 visit pass at the local maker space for $85 and do it myself.
1pc acrylic door: $49 for material and laser cutting.  maybe less if i buy material and do it myself again.
misc. hardware $30

all in it should be no more than $320

all constructive feedback is appreciated.

thanks,

magnetic door latches also work well for something like that.

that's a good point, and i will definitely keep it in mind.  pla certainly does get brittle, but i didn't think cycling from 70f-100f heat cycle (i wouldn't expect this box to get much warmer than that) would be enough to do it since the glass transition is closer to 140f.  magnetic door latches would be a nice addition.
discojon wrote:i'd skip the alum extrusion and print some connectors or even dovetail the birch.  that would save $93 right off the bar.  also consider lighting,  looks awful dark in there.  maybe some led's mounted on the top front cross member or sides?  lastly, consider making it easily removable by lifting off the taz and not having cords and such pass through cutouts, it sucks to have to partially disassemble the machine to just take the cover off.  maybe get a big cardboard box and cut it out, use it for a bit to see if you really like it?  i have only encountered, maybe 2 prints where i needed an enclosure, but i just threw a blanket over the taz.  

having said that, i will offer to laser cut (if the total dimension is less that 500x700) or cnc route the birch for you if you would like.  just buy materials and pay shipping.

i considered skipping the aluminum.  i like how clean it would look without, but i would miss having something to grab onto to lift it or bolt attachments to.
lights are a good note - i actually bought a strip of led's early this year and never got around to installing them.  i'll definitely add those once i have the enclosure.  just added this to original post.
being able to just lift it off is also a great point.  i'll probably end up having a base that the printer sits on, and then have a 5 sided box that just drops over it.  i can cut a rectangle out of the bottom edge of the back and print a piece that fits in it with slots sized for the cables, so that it can be updated easily, kind of like the back of a pc case and that motherboard adapter plate that snaps in.  i'll update that this weekend and put an update.
the enclosure is primarily for noise, because the printer is in my living room, but it also has to look decent.  my wife does not appreciate the blanket covered taz ""ghost"" look.

i really appreciate the offer to laser or route the parts.  unfortunately they all exceed that 500mm dimension.  where are you located?"
dual extruder second head bumping,"hello, can anyone with the dual extruder (taz5) tell me how to avoid the second hot end bumping the model as it passes by the perimeter of the model? i have checked the front to back vertical alignment and it seems to be perfectly aligned, yet as it is printing with the first head the second head will bump the model edge and some other slightly higher points on the model.  do i need to worry about these bumps?

head question,"hi all,
so, i don't actually have a taz 5 yet, but just doing my research.

i see that the flexystruder is out of stock, but could i get the flexydually and just use the flexy side of it as a single extruder for ninjaflex?  then if i wanted to use both extruders, i would have the best of both worlds, right?

thanks for helping the new guy.
ken","you could indeed do that, with one important note. the current version of the flex duly for sale is the older version that uses 2 buddaschnozzle hotends. you would need to alter the stock taz 5 firmware slightly to use it. the new version with 2 hexagon hotends is in design phase, nearing or in production for sale soon. you could make your own from the prototype files in devel.lulzbot.com"
0.35 vs 0.50 extruder nozzles,"following a long period of heavy use, my taz 4 has earned itself the reward of some upgrades.  among other things, i ordered a ""single extruder tool head v2"" and unintentionally purchased the 0.35 mm diameter nozzle.  my recollection is that the 0.50mm nozzle is generally recommended.

i haven't removed it from the box yet so i have the potential to exchange it, but before i do i thought i should ask what benefit i might gain from the smaller nozzle?  would there be a reason to maintain *both* sizes?

thanks,
paul","the smaller nozzle would allow you to print things with sharper corners and generally makes printing thinner layers easier, though it is possible to print very thin layers with a 0.5mm nozzle as well. print time on a 0.35mm nozzle is going to be higher, but if you mainly print smaller parts, it can be worth keeping around. you can also order a replacement nozzle in a different size, the ones used on the hexagon aren't that bad to swap out apparently."
taz 5 hexagon extruder mount freecad file,"does anyone know where i could find the freecad file for the taz 5 production version of the hexagon extruder mount?  i have been able to find the stl in the printed_parts directory and a freecad file for the buda mount in the freecad directory, but not for the hexagon mount.  i have checked the accessories directory as well and found the development files related to the hexagon but the mount there is different then the production one.  i want to make a few changes and would like to start with the cad file, not an stl conversion.

thanks!
steven","i have a taz 4 with a the buda extruder, can i purchase a hexagon hotend and replace the buda hotend using the same extruder setup.
are there any changes to i need to make to the buda extruder, do i need to print any new parts. 

also if i want to print 1.75 filament, what are your thoughts on purchasing a hexagon hotend that is setup for 1.75 filament. i have read on the forum that people have been able to get the 3.00 hexagon hotend to work with 1.75 filament, but with mixed results."
quality problems,"i owned the taz 5 for about five months.  i absolutely love it and is constantly surprised by the quality of models it produces. this last week the quality has been really inconsistent. the infill layers don't reach to the outer perimeters and leaves a gap. i also found out that when bridging, it doesn't reach the otherside before turning back in the other direction. it only does this going from certain directions , right to left. the first thing i tried was to increase the extrusion multiplier and filament diameter that really didn't help. i then thought it might be that the x axis carriage might be uneven due to being on different threads on the rod. it was uneven but when i started a print it didn't effect the quality. i leveled the bed. i'm out of ideas , i run everything default on slicer except retraction because after it retracts nothing will come out for a while after so it set 1mm instead of 2. i also get a pitted surface but usually if i slow the speed down to 30mm/s it's perfect.
here's some pics","we had neary the same problems with our printer at work (non-lulzbut, but shouldn't matter). the extrusion temperature was a little bit to low, in our case i increased it by 10°c and the prints were perfect again.
the first thing i tried was to increase the extrusion multiplier and filament diameter that really didn't help.

by the way, if you increase extrusion multiplier and increase filament diameter, you may not change anything in reality.
higher extrusion multiplier = more flow
higher diameter = less flow (if the diameter of the filament increases, the stepper has to do fewer steps to extrude the same volume of plastic)"

wire harness routing clips for extrusion,"i've made some simple printed clips that attach to the aluminum extrusion with a 90 degree twist, and hold the wiring harnesses.  eliminates most of  the zip ties and allows for easy removal and reattachment and secure routing.  also it looks a little neater.  i've also put these files, along with the scad versions, up on thingiverse (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:820557).

filament arm pivot mod,"i made  a pivot arm mount to position the standard pivoting filament arm, off of the extrusion without the folded arm breaking the plane of the printer frame.  the purpose behind doing this was part of a series of small modifications to clear the printer frame of obstructions top facilitate attaching a low profile enclosure.  anyways attached is the stl for printing it, and some pictures of the resulting mount.  this mod requires a short m5 flathead bolt, and a m5 nut, in addition to using two m5 t nuts, and two short bolts to mount to the frame.

printing stop. object not complete,"hello,
just received my taz5 yesterday and is very impressed with it, i was able to level the bed and print out a test object. since this is not my first printer, i have a few large objects (around 5 inches tall and 3 inches wide) i wanted to print out. the quality is great, however 3/4th into the print, the printer just stopped. 
except for the 1/4 part that is missing, i would say the print was a success. my question is, do i have to set something in cura so the printer knows how tall the object is to complete? i'll be able to print the rest of the object as a separate part using slic3r and glue them together. but i would rather have a single object. thanks in advance.","window 7 16 gig of ram. 5 inches tall. it looks like its a cura model problem. 
normal view in cura show the entire model, but in layer view i see where the top part is will not print.

how can i print the gcode that is generated by slic3r. do i have to have a sd reader and copy the file on that and return back to the taz slot?"
taz4 / rambo aux fan wiring?,"hi

here's my issue:
stock taz 4 w/ fan 
edit: stock lulzbot pla slic3r medium speed settings
pla jams during hours-long print every time. 
 

diagnostics:
the ""cold"" upper bit of the hot end is brand-your-skin hot.
extruder motor pretty hot. 
hobbed bolt is relatively cool.
worse with cheap pla, better with quality pla, but always.
pla is wedged in hot end and difficult to extract.

my goal:
to install an auxiliary fan, dedicated to keeping the heat sink sunk.  
i don't need to control it with slic3r - if i have to, i'll just put a switch on it or have it always be on. 
 bonus points for independent software control.


question:
where should i tap into power on the rambo board for a second independent fan?
for the time being, i am just going quick and dirty with a 12v wall wart. 
(please don't tell me to print faster - i want the quality of a slower print. that is a kludge; i want a solution.)



editorial / background:
i have given up on the possibility of printing abs with the taz 4.
the hot bed is useless for maintaining a warm printing envelope.
abs is completely unprintable on this machine without horrid curling/ warping. 
even in a box. even with a fox. pet is garbage, 
my metric is a $700 printrbot kit that has consistently kicks my taz' butt when printing abs.
i have high but reasonable standards for print quality, as i print my designs and sell them to paying customers.","assuming you are using marlin-2014q3 firmware

why is leveling so difficult?,"so i've been hapilly playing with my mini for a while now and had a few projects that needed a bigger printer surface. so, i bought the taz 5. 

i've been trying to level this thing for close to five hours now. is it me? am i just a complete idiot? or is there a learning curve... and once i have it down, it will be much easier next time?

i'm so frustrated. i'm about to pack this thing up and ship it back to amazon.  ","there is a bit of a learning curve. you can end up chasing the level point around the bed if you aren't careful. here's what i do to level mine.

1. make sure the printer itself is level and the y axis is installed without a wire pinched between the frames. that happens sometimes and makes leveling tough.
2. using calipers measure the height from the aluminum bed plate to the underside of the heated bed at the front left corner leveling screw. now use that measurement and transfer that same measurement to the other corners. adjust height as needed.
3. now adjust the z homing screw so the nozzle is about a business card thickness off the bed. i use the thin metal depth probe that came with my printer for that. the nozzle will expand when hot so do that with the printer at print temperature. 
4. now move the nozzle around the bed and use your feeler gouge to measure and adjust the gap. move it over 3 inches, measure and adjust, move again repeat etc.
at that point you should be level but print the bed calibration code file to be sure.

once it is level you will rarely have to move the adjustment."
pei bed sticks too much,"i love my taz 5.

i have been printing pla for a while now and the middle of the pei bed is heavily used.  i am finding my prints stick too well there.  on the less used parts it sticks the perfect amount.

i tried some alcohol but it seems like it needs a bit of a harder clean.  any recommendations?","this could be:
- the less used parts of the bed may be dirty and thus not adherinng as much
- nozzle sag, thus the middle of the bed is closer to the nozzle causing too much adhesion

in general adhesion to pei boils down to the squash of the first layer (how close the nozzle is to the bed).  an eight or sixteenth counterclock wise turn on the endstop should help.  use a business card as a feeler to check the nozzle height.  for even more granular control of the nozzle height, use the z-offset to raise (positive value) or lower (negative value) the nozzle after homed... i find that .1 increments !take a big difference on the pei.


to cure the sag, folks have replaced the rods and bearings with hardened rods and metal bearings."
budaschnozzle not heating,"for some reason, my extruder isn't heating at all on my taz 4. there weren't really any events that happened before this fault that would make sense as a reason for it to stop heating, and i'm looking for some suggestions on troubleshooting this issue. i do have another taz 4 at work that i'm going to try putting my extruder on to. hopefully this helps me narrow it down to it being either the heat cartridge on the extruder, or the actual controller.
if you have any suggestions i would be very appreciative!.","what does the temperature reading say on the lcd?

you can start by double-checking the connections. those are possible failure points.

since you're going to disconnect it, if you have access to an ohm meter, you can try checking the heating element and the thermistor.

the heating element is a 4.7 ohm resistor, so you should get a reading in that area. the heating element is the front device in the heating block, and on mine it's connected to the red wires in the connector. (if you're using a typical low - medium cost multimeter, then also measure the resistance of just the test leads by touching the probes together tightly, and subtract this from your reading of the resistor.)

the thermistor is a resistor that varies value depending on its temperature. it provides the temperature reading and feedback to the controller. it's connected to the orange wires in the connector. i believe it should be roughly in the area of 80k ohms (80,000) at room temperature. if you heat it up by breathing on it, you should see the resistance drop toward 70k ohms. (but that's if you take it out of the heater block. you'll have to use other means to heat it if it's still in the block. if you see a normal room temperature reading on the lcd, then the thermistor is probably ok.)

if either of these are open, check the connections between the connector and the devices to see if anything came loose. lulzbot stocks both as replacement parts."
adjusting belt tension for perfect circles,"hi there,

i've been having problems with printing circles, which turn to be more oval-shaped.
i've read multiple threads (viewtopic.php?f=7&t=2218, viewtopic.php?f=7&t=1397, viewtopic.php?t=971) all referring to belt tension.
i would like to check if the y axis belt is tight enough and to tighten it if necessary, but not too sure how to do so (sorry if it sounds stupid).

how would you know if the belt is tight enough?
if the belt is loose, should both the screws be tightened?
does tightening the belt should go along with adjusting the firmware y-steps? (i'm afraid the concept of x/y/x-step is still obscure to me)

thanks!","belt tension adjustments do not require any firmware adjustments. a stepper motor is basically a normal motor, but with the ability for you to give it a certain amount of power and precisely turn a certain distance. one unit of distance is called a step. you can think of them kind of like stair steps. stair steps are usually uniform in size. if you go down 10 stair steps, you go a certain distance that is twice as far as traveling 5 stair steps.   the y steps value indicates how many possible stopping points in its rotation  or steps the motor shaft needs to travel for the bed to move 1 mm.

to check if the bed is tight enough, pluck the belt like a bass guitar string. it should make a dull twang. it may give a little, but it should not feel mushy or look like it is sagging. to adjust the belt tension, you loosen one end of the belt retention piece under the bed, pull on that end of the belt until it is tight (or roll it around a pair of needlenose pliers, etc.)  and then re-tighten the belt retention mount. 

usually a loose belt will show up as an out of round circle. yours are a little out of round, but some of that also is the nozzle start point for that layer it looks like. generally it doesn't hurt to tighten the belts, but it may not help either."

after several lengthy prints (10-15 hrs), one side of the pei is separating from the adhesive.  this is causing the bed level adjustments to get totally out of whack.  any suggestions or recommendations on better adhesion?  i have another pei sheet and 3m adhesive sheet that will allow me to change out the pei on the build plate.  when done previously, i thoroughly cleaned the class prior to setting the adhesive in place.  the pei protective film was removed and immediately the pei sheet placed upon the adhesive.  then reinstalled the build plate in the machine.

 should the build plate be placed into some type of compression to ""push"" the pei onto the adhesive more firmly?  

thanks,

oklahoma city","as i recall, when the bubbling pei issue first came up, i saw a mention in this forum from a factory guy that they'd had to add a ""bake-out""  procedure with the build plates to improve things.

i've begun doing something like that, myself.  here's what happened to me:

i had a bad pei bubbling/blistering issue with my taz5, it was one of the fairly early ones.  lulzbot, with their usual great customer service, sent me a new build plate asap.

i should mention that, looking back, the blistering on my original build plate only started getting bad after i'd let the printer sit unused for a week, then began using it again.

anyhow, when i got the new build plate i installed it and did a test run up to 110 c (i mostly do abs), and there was no blistering.  then i didn't touch the taz for two weeks, due to some family obligations that had come up.

during that period it was hot and very humid here, unusually so for southern california.

then when i turned it on for the first time after not using it for that two weeks, i immediately saw that the pei was starting to blister!

thinking about it, my assumption was that it had absorbed humidity from the air during those two weeks.  so i started by warming the plate to 30 c for a day, and saw no problem.  then i took it up to 40 c for a day, and saw no problem.  i repeated that process in 10 degree steps, giving it around 6-8 hours minimum at each temperature, until i got it up to 110 c and there was still no problem!

in effect, that was two tests on two different build plates, with the same result: a longish period of inactivity in a high-humidity environment resulted in blistering.  and ever since, i run the plate up to 50 degrees or so for four hours or so, if i haven't done anything on the machine for a few days, just to keep it dried out.

doing that, i've had zero problems with blistering.  and that's with the replacement plate that had started to blister when i first ran it after two weeks of non-use.

so read into that what you will, but i believe that moisture is absorbed into the adhesive layer, at least partly through the pei but also along the edges since the problems generally seem to start around the edges.

and my experience says that warming the plate to 50 c or so for a few hours every few days of non-use will keep the problem from coming back.

for folks who print with pla, it's probably less of a problem.  maybe in drier seasons or locations it's not a problem.  in winter, when the heater runs a lot, it's probably not a problem, for instance.

anyhow, you might try an approach like that, especially after putting on a new pei layer, to see if it helps."
taz 5 upgraded rods and bearings,"upgraded my rods to hardened misumi rods. replaced linear bearings with jsb.  i guess i have a couple questions.

are the bearings supposed to sound ""crunchy"" (for the lack of a better word)?  my x axis seems fine, z does not move fast enough for me to notice, however, the y axis is the one i really hear it from.  could it be due to slight binding? i noticed that in replacing the igus bearings with jsb linear ball bearings, it is a hair thicker and causes the single bearing holders to open slightly wider and that made it hard for me to line up each bearing holder with the screw holes. 

i get this funny wavy pattern on the z axis now, presumably it's from all the crunching.  

that said though, i'm testing print speeds at 100 mm/s and it seems to be doing good.  there's definitely no more slop like the igus bearings had.","i have been all around the block with the bearings and rods. i print thin walled parts with translucent pla. those parts really ""highlight"" the ripples generated by the loose tolerance stock igus bearings. i have replaced my x and y rods with hardened misumi parts and have tried three different brands of metal bearings on y. my x axis seems fine but, i always get what you describe here on y, a rough sounding and feeling motion. while the rods and metal bearings eliminated the slop and ripples, they caused a new textured finish to appear on the printed parts anytime y was in motion. again, with the type of parts and material i am printing, it looked pretty bad. i ended up going back to the stock igus bearing and just putting up with the ripples. 

here is a link to a post i made regarding the bearing problem. i have also tried several different types of lube... no joy. maybe the amazon, misumi and vxb bearings i have tried are all crap and i need to go to a bearing house. i don't know.

i am currently looking very closely at piercet's openrail upgrades. he says they are butter smooth and tight... my problem is that the machine i would want to experiment with is a taz 2 so i think i would need to upgrade to taz 4 y axis supports to install his openrail mod... not sure on that yet, though."
taz 5 horizontal ridges,"hi, i'm having an issue i wanted to see if anyone has seen this or could help.  i'm printing on a taz 5 and am getting some horizontal ridges or waves (see pic).  i've printed these parts for quite some time on my taz 4 with no issues, but ever since i started printing on the 5, they have existed.  below are some details of the print.  all settings and gcode are the same as my taz 4.  i bet i can make some adjustments to the gcode, but i'd love input from others to potentially save time experimenting.

material is 3mm black abs from lulzbot
extruder temp is 242
no enclosure

thanks in advance.",i think the screw that holds the drive pulley to the stepper motor may be loose.  when mine was loose i had this problem and eventually my prints would all lean to one side / aka drift left.
minimal size enclosure,"outside of a handle and latch, i finally finished my minimal sized enclosure.  the dimensions are 24 1/4"" wide, 26 1/4"" deep and 21"" high.  making the enclosure this small meant that i had to cut a hole in the side for the electronics box.  as a bonus, this works out as a solution to providing cool air to the box. it also allowed me to move the lcd controller outside the box on the front, with the cables being just long enough.  i drilled a small hole on one side for the usb, and a hole in the rear on the other side for the power cord.  i also cut a slit on the top for the feed tube.  i got the link for the printed brackets http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:675652
if you want to use these brackets, i would recommend only using two screws per side on the 3 hole parts.
scott","you have to cut a slot on the top for the filament, but once done, there's no problem.  you want to make the slot fairly narrow so you loose less heat.  this means the position of the slot is pretty important.  i noticed that i could have move the slot perhaps 1/16"" farther forward.  as it is now, the tube slightly rubs along the front edge of the slot.  not enough for me to make any further mods, but i wish i had gotten the position just a bit better.  as for the plexi, i used 1 1/2 4sx8 sheets of 1/8"" polycarb.  i had the major pieces cut out by the supplier for a nominal cost, then cut the slot, door and holes and drilled all the screw holes myself.  with 6 screws for the edge brackets, and 12 screws for the corner brackets, that turned out to be 156 screw holes, screws and nuts.  i used 10-24 x 1/2"" screws. my plastics supplier also had 12"" acrylic hinges, so i used one for the door.  it's attached with vhb tape from bron tapes inc.

i was thinking of adding a sliding cover for the filament slot.  if i print it, i'll have to design one in two pieces because of it's length.  might be easier to cut one out of some thin plastic stock.

question on the lulzbot taz 5,"i was thinking of expanding the lulzbot taz 5 build size
     with a list resources , tools , there specifications , the price in canadian dollars
and where i can find them , and how that would be done","that's a lot of customization.  it's going to depend on which axis you want to expand... or all.  

at the very least you'll need 2020 aluminum extrusion to extend or build a new frame.  a larger aluminum plate to support the print surface. larger borosilcat glass of alu!inum for the print bed.  longer rods and acem screws.

there are threads in the development section... see mega-taz and onodrim."
taz 3 help,"i just bought a refurbished taz 3. this is my first 3d printer, but i have a couple cnc machines, so i'm pretty familiar with most of the concepts, and have been lurking on this subreddit for awhile.

i was doing some test prints and i just can't get anything all that great out of it. it's a taz 3, but has a pei bed, upgraded 600w power supply, and a few little upgrades here and there. i leveled the bed as best as i could. i actually used some 123 blocks to get it leveled, and that helped a bit. i then set the z position and got it to where it would lay down the first layer without curling up, or mashing it down. i made a 1cm cube in solidworks and exported it to an stl file and tried printing that. here's an album with 3 tests:

http://imgur.com/a/q3uy0

i'm using hips (esun). bed temp is 85c, extruder temp is 230. 100mm/sec is the speed (on the third i tried slowing it down and it didn't do a lot). i measured the filament and it's around 2.9mm on average, so i'm using that. any thoughts? i've seen some great stuff come from a taz, but so far mine's pretty far from that  i'm using the custom version of cura, using the taz 4 profile (there's no profile for 3).","printing with pla will require a cooling fan for best results. without one it's going to probably look somewhat melty. it also prints at different temperatures. it doesn't lift at all though, which can make dialing the printer in easier. a lot of people prefer it as a first filament, but you really want to add the fan. here's the instructions for adding the fan kit to a taz 2, which is essentially a taz 3 in terms of electronics https://ohai-kit.alephobjects.com/proje ... ruder-fan/ 

if the nozzle is digging into the part, that can be indicative of overextruding. your z steps looked fine from the other part. the only reason those would be off is if you had taz 4 or 5 firmware on a 3, since the 4/5 uses better leadscrews. your prints would look like squished buttons if that were the case though. definitely run through an extruder calibration when you get a chance. 

if the carriage is too lose, you may need to replace the bearings. one stopgap you can do in the mean time is loosen both bearing carriages and move them either both in to the center, or both out to the edge, depending on where you get the best contact pattern. in to the center is preferable as that will have the bearings ride on the outer edges of the rods. i would recommend printing a taz 5 carriage when you get time and get the printer dialed in. it's lighter than the 3 carriage and will bolt in place. 

since you have a taz 3, i would recommend you go here at some point soon : http://i-t-w.com/hardware/ 
and purchase the parts necessary to upgrade your printer to a taz 4/5 spec. specifically these x end plates are next to impossible to find, and they only come up for sale infrequently so you may want to snag those if you ever plan to upgrade your printer in the future. http://i-t-w.com/hardware/taz-x-axis-end-plate 
they also have the leadscrews which you can source elsewhere, but that's not a bad price for them.
http://i-t-w.com/hardware/lulzbot-taz-4 ... readed-rod
and the leadscrew nuts http://i-t-w.com/hardware/taz-45-z-axis ... mi-mtsrr12
the rest of the parts you can make easy enough."
major fail during build,"we got our taz 5 a few weeks ago and have made some parts on it that were all run mostly during the day.  last night we decided to run a slightly modified version of a part that we had run before and came in to find the printer as in the attached picture.





the first layer was under the build platform and there was a large blob of material you can see on the right side.  then it looks like at some point it was able to lay down a few layers that somewhat stuck together on top of the randomly extruded birds next.  i can sort of understand if the base delaminated from the build platform and was able to move that the mess of material could have been caused but what i don't understand is the blob, even if the y axis jammed x would still have been able to move.

we used cura abs_cura_medium_0.5taz profile downloaded from the lulzbot site with no changes.  this is the same profile we used on the lat print as well and had no issues. 

my biggest concerns now is can we clean the print head which is covered in burnt abs.","well, i found a little bit more information that may have been the reason for the fail.  the person who set up the print did so somewhat blindly.  he started cura on his computer and chose taz mini, saved the g-code and took opened it on the printer computer.  i told him to load the print profile for taz 5, medium, 0.5 nozzle which he did but the machine was still set to mini.  

he pre-heated the print head and bed then said it wouldn't print till he closed the control and moved the part into the center of the bed (because it thought it was a mini the part barely fit).  

i'm thinking the bed temp didn't get set again so as it cooled the part came loose and stuck to the print head.

we cleaned up the head as best we could and i redid all the settings now it's printing again, so far two hours in and running fine so keeping our fingers crossed."

[solved] taz 2.0: glcd shows nothing (factory reset from usb?),"hi guys, after updating the firmware as instructed by lulzbot helpdesk, my glcd shows nothing  
it lights up, but shows no number, letter, or anything for that matter.

i reported the issue but they say i should try again and that they no longer support my machine (the ""old"" taz 2) and my only hope is in the forum...
the glcd was working fine. for some stupid reason i decided to i update the firmware, and i did so using the ""marlin-12v.cpp.hex"" file through cura, as recommended by lulzbot. and then everything went to hell. 

is there a way to do a complete factory reset? it would have to be through the usb from my computer i guess, since i see nothing in the glcd. by the way what is the function of the two wholes below the glcd? one of them is a button...

please if you would give me a hint, i'm worried already   and i need to make a few prints! first the usb connection started failing (which i reported in another post) but now this seems even more serious because i can't even print from the sd :'(

any help, comment, whatever, will be super appreciated!! thanks!

windows7pro 64bits","ok, i have tried. i try explain in detail hoping it will make it easier to understand and hopefully y to help me! 
this what happens when i follow the instructions (https://www.lulzbot.com/support/re-flas ... s-firmware)

first i need the values of esteps and default_axis_steps_per_unit. in the webpage it says that information should be found with the documentation of your 3d printer, which is not my case (taz 2). i got the manual but the documentation does not include these ""technicalities"". so there's the problem of knowing the right values for my taz 2.0 
esteps:  when i send m503 command in pronterface, i get nothing back. so i'm doing something wrong or it's not behaving as expected according to the instructions:
https://www.lulzbot.com/support/re-flas ... s-firmware
fortunately i had written down the values from a previous lcd inspection. so the value is esteps/mm: +0824.0

default_axis_steps_per_unit: this one i have no idea. i never knew these values. and there is definitely no documentation about this included in my printers papers. i noticed there's a file (configuration.h~) which looks like the ""original"" of the ""current"" one i need to verify/change (configuration.h). i assume configuration.h~ it's the ""original"" file because it names the printer something like ""this mendel"" while configuration.h uses the name ""taz"" instead. 
having no more information available and no more knowledge/expertise, i assume the configuration.h file is a modified configuration.h~ suited for my taz. this assumption may very well be flat wrong, but i really need to try something.
i checked that the values for default_axis_steps_per_unit are different in configuration.h~ and configuration.h so again at the risk of being wrong i assume the values could be fine for my printer and left them like that.
#define default_axis_steps_per_unit   {100.5,100.5,800,800}  // default steps per unit

now, i assuming those values are ok or at least would let me continue, i tryed the re-flashing of the firmware and it didn't work

new heated bed,"hello all,

just a simple question. i am wanting to get a new heated print bed. the one that i currently have has some grooves/indentations in it that are starting to mess some of my prints. i would like to have the same one that came with my taz 5. i found this link on the lulzbot website:

https://www.lulzbot.com/products/pcb-heatbed-mk1

is this the same bed? and if not, do any of you know where i could get one?

much thanks,

jacob r.","that is not the same heated bed. that's an older one that was used on the ao-101 and ao-100 printers. you need this one: https://www.lulzbot.com/products/24v-silicone-heater and a glass plate https://www.lulzbot.com/products/borosi ... 0mm-x300mm and a pei sheet with adhesive

you might call lulzbot directly and see if they will sell you an assembly. 

if you have to replace the bed and build your own, i'd also highly recommend using a 12"" x 12"" x 3/16"" aluminum plate instead of the glass. i just switched over to that on mine, and the difference in adhesion is amazing. i have the bed corner stl for using the slightly larger aluminum plate if you want them ."
deformation of extruder body,"i've had my taz 5 for about 6 months now.  love it, most of the time.  about 3-4 months ago, i had the extruder body part crack/delaminate right where the rear bearing mounts. once i finally figured out what was happening, i got lulzbot to replace some parts, and i was off and running.  first thing, build a spare print-head.  the reason i knew something was wrong is abs parts started to fail as the hobbed bolt would eat the filament.  what i could tell is there was excessive slop and motion on the hobbed bolt assembly.  

fast forward to friday, same thing started happening.  ok, time to test that spare print head.  i have it running beautifully on the spare head again, and we're happy, but while my extruder body didn't crack, it did deform.  the ear that the idler arm mounts to had excessive wear on the back surface, and the flat area where the back bearing fits was no longer flat but slightly deformed, messing up the assembly.

it may be because i run my machine in an enclosure since i prefer to use abs, that the overall heat causes some problems.  i've rebuild the other head and have it ready for next time, but i'm thinking of building a set of parts out of nylon to see if that improves the life.  i was just wondering if anyone else saw this happen?  i was at the 3d print show in pasadena today, and was talking to matterhackers which is where i bought my taz, and they were telling me they run their taz with a flexystruder for all materials.  they felt it is a more robust tool-head.  anyone else do this?","what's the temp in the enclosure?  if it's getting to 85c, the abs could be softening enough to deform.  

this based on some material i found about 1/8th"" abs sheets deforming at 185f.  worked it into my strategy for heat bed temps... first 4mm at 110c for good adhesion and allow the plastic to rest, then drop to 100-90c to lock that foundation in place to reduce warp, and 10min before estimated end drop to 60c. wait 5min after print and bed temp should be at 45-50c... which shouldn't adversely affect pei adhesive.  

printing the extruder and gears in nylon would take enclosure temp out of the equation and would be more durable overall.  go for it!"
taz 5 and printing spare parts,"hello all (first post),

i've had my great taz 5 up and running for about a couple of weeks. i've been wondering about printing backup parts. there are a ton of different versions of each part. which versions should i use (or are there parts that are better than the stock parts)?

for instance, the herringbone small gear at http://download.lulzbot.com/taz/5.0/pro ... ar-.35noz/ has larger versions of the file all the way up to 25 meg. which version should i use?

thanks!","they are abs. do not attempt to use pla ones, there is enough heat there to soften them quite a bit over time and they will warp. 

part failures i have had over many many many hours of printing:
idler arms
extruder bearings (have 3 sealed-type bearings on hand, you will wear them out eventually)
extruder gears, more small than large ones
cracked an extruder carriage once mid print, still have no idea why to this day as it wasn't under a particular amount of stress
z motor mount blocks at the rod mount."
taz 3 x/z axis upgrade,"hi

i am hoping to bring my taz 3 to life by upgrading the x/z printed parts so that the extruder is stable. could someone advise the following:

1. can i easily download all the files for taz4 and taz5 from the download area in one go. i had to download all the taz 3 files one-by-one, however the new taz's are all in separate folders, it's going to take me hours. if i can get the files, i can compare and make my own designs.

2. if the above is not possible can someone advise which parts would work on the taz 3. i have upgraded proper cnc couplings but still using the original threaded rod for the z axis.

many thanks

thinking about buying a taz 5,"i know its been beaten to death but here i am.

i am buying a 3d printer today! no more putting it off! but i just cant decide between the makergear m2 and the lulzbot taz 5. i've heard amazing things about both.

i'm mainly planning to build prototypes for some designs/inventions with maybe some commercial side work for a little extra cash (but that is for another day) thus i really want something reliable that prints well. i've got a full time job, a wife and toddler with another one on the way. i want to keep tinkering and repairs to a minimum - something i hear is questionable on the taz 5? its not that i cannot manage to tinker and repair, i'm a mechanical engineer (i tinker enough at my day job), i simply do not have the time. what precious time i do have i would like to spend bringing my ideas to reality. out of the box printing (while not reality from what i have read) is what i am aiming for. i've read some things that say the taz 5 is not as good at this? confirm or deny?

the taz 5  with its extra print size very tempting. but on the flip side the makergear community is either drinking the cool-aid or the printer is seriously the one to rule them all! how can i ignore 138 reviews on amazon with a 4.9 rating... seriously, not a single 1 or 2 star review out of all of those for the m2?

on the taz 5, out of just 28 reviews, 15% of them are 1 stars... but thats not to say that it still doesnt have 4.5 stars. there seems to be a few complaints about the taz 5 and needing to constantly ""tinker"" with the leveling ect. honestly i'm leaning more towards the m2 because some of the negative reviews on the taz 5 are scaring me away. but then thats why i'm here.

here are my questions:

1. how often does everyone use the larger print size, how often do you print something larger than 8-10 inches? my current parts/designs are 1""x10""x1"" so i am already pushing the build area of the m2 and i cannot say in the future if i will need the extra size or not. i may end up getting the taz 5 to never use the extra envelope.

2. i've tried to find info on the dual extruder but i've only found minimal. i'd like to keep my options open for the possibility to use soluble support material. anyone have any experience with the dual extruder on the m2 vs the taz 5? does anyone recommend the dual extruder  even or is it not reliable?

3. is the taz 5 truly reliable or are the negative reviews true? are the negative reviews due to incompetence? but then why does the makergear m2 community not have a single bad review while the taz 5 consistently is rated just below it (among the websites i found, i understand its subjective, not trying to argue one way or another. i just want to hear taz 5 users response to these).

p.s. - this is my first 3d printer and i have no experience (lots of research though). however this isnt really a concern for me. i was also originally looking at the airwolf hd2x since it comes all setup for dual extrusion but i have since realized i'd probably be over paying for nothing of value.","the bed leveling will likely need some initial adjustment out of the box, but after that, it will be pretty solid and only need adjusting a minor amount once a month or so. earlier taz units before the taz 4 had a smaller z endstop target on the motion axis that would work it's way loose over time. the 4 and 5 units do not have this issue. repairs are not an issue on the taz. you may end up needing to replace the extruder gears after months of printing, as they will wear over time, but you can print those yourself as well. the larger gears on the greg wade style extruder the taz is equipped with mean that it will feed a bit better than some of the direct drive extruders due to additional mechanical advantage. the m2 uses a direct drive system. 

1. i use the larger print size fairly often. i printed the frame to my mini rov with it. http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:451236 if you are printing with abs, regardless of the printer, you may need an enclosure to get good layer adhesion. that is going to be a common theme regardless of which printer you choose though.  you can also however print things smaller and glue them together into larger assemblies. abs glues well, with plastruct plastic weld model glue

2. don't consider dual extrusion at all when looking to purchase your first 3d printer. soluable support material sounds great in theory, but its one of those features that people go back and forth and obsess over, and then rarely use. if you want it, you can add it to any of the higher end 3d printers at a later date. if adding a dual extruder is something that seems too complicated or time consuming, learning to operate and use it properly is even worse, so take that into consideration. if you truely want a dual extruder, there are updated dual extruder files in test under devel.lulzbot.com for use with the hexagon hotend and cooling fans. you would have to build it at this point though. 

3. a taz is a pretty solid printer. the rails on the m2 x and y give it a bit of a resolution advantage, but the frame design of the taz gives it a bit of an advantage over the m2. some of the bad reveiws are going to be either incompetence or people unfamiliar with how to use a large print bed printer. with a very large spring supported bed, it is going to need an initial adjustment before it will print levely out of the box. many people go from a smaller printer with auto leveling to a taz, expect it to work without setting it up properly, and then are dissapointed when one of the corners won't stick properly even though it's their own fault. 

other people expect to be able to print giant abs things without accounting for abs thermal contraction and lifting. you can print very large things without an enclosure on a taz, but it takes skill to set the printer up properly to do so. since it has a much larger bed than other printers, i think people have an unfair expectation that printing very large things is somehow going to be magically much easier on a taz without learning about proper bed adhesion and fillament temperatures and the like. 

the stock taz nylon rod bearings and rods do have a small amount of play in them out of the box. my experiance is based on a taz 3 that has been upgraded to 4/5 spec so the bearings they use on the newer ones may have better tolerances. thats one area where the m2 does perform better on x and y anyways due to the rails they use. you can equip a stock taz 5 with rails as well but it takes some time and effort and funds to do so. you'll have to ask yourself if a +/- 0.01mm z variance is more important than the larger print area. 

the taz does also have a stand alone printing lcd controller included stock. if printing in autonamous mode without a computer powered on is a feature you might need, it's there already on a taz. you would have to add it to an m2. 

one area where the taz is going to stand out is that lulzbot support on the taz is amazing inside the warranty period.  the staff is responsive, they fix problems quickly when they infrequintly come up, and i've not encountered many people who weren't happy with them. 

i think the taz has a larger user community and more aftermarket modifications created for it. 

you may also want to take a look at the mendelmax 3 kit. 

hope that helps!"
[solved]question plug,"i recently bought my first 3d printer the lulzbot taz 5,
when assembling i found a loose part from a plug in the protection foam, its was broken


on further infestation i saw the broken part wasn't even wired with a cable.
my question is, can use the plugs without any problems? 


guido","just go a email from the helpdesk:

fortunately those are just guide pins to make sure that you don't plug the connector in backwards. they have no function with current. please just plug the connector back in and the printer will work properly.

they are just for a measure of safety

taz review @ 3dprinter.net,"here's a nice new taz review:

http://www.3dprinter.net/3d-printer-review-lulzbot-taz","this is an oldie but goodie  anyone looking for the latest reviews can find them here on our site: https://www.lulzbot.com/news/reviews

for example, the lulzbot taz 5 was just named editors' choice by tom's guide! read more here: http://www.tomsguide.com/us/lulzbot-taz ... -3045.html"
unable to unscrew nozzle after clogged feed for several hours unattended.,"i think i know exactly what happened but i wanted to get more info if possible.

1. i started a 9 hour print just before going to bed. 
2. 1 hr into the print i came back and everything appeared fine.
3. i woke up to what appeared to be a simple sheer of the filament at the feed point so the printer didn't finish the job.
4. i powered off the printer. 
5. ate breakfast.
6. came back powered up unit.
7. preheated for abs.
8 . nozzle - 230 bed -100
9. after 10 min i came back to only find the bed hot and the nozzle cold and showing ~20c 
10. i repeated the process several times to see what was happening. 

< at this point i decided to take off tool head and the hot end to see what was wrong >

upon examination  noticed that the heat resistor, 4.7 ohm was moving very freely so i decided to straighten the wires, and gently slide out the resistor and then take a look at the resistor. it appeared to be very malformed.

<pic here>





















i attempted to lightly unscrew the nozzle at this point and it would not budge. it seemed to be chemically welded to the hot end.

so i tried again with a bit more force and snap. 

at this point i have basically destroyed part of my hotend trying to get what appears to be a chemically welded nozzle attached to the threads of a budaschnozzle 2.0 threaded extension tube off. and want to understand why it happened.

so to fix i bought 

1. nozzzle .35 -  19.00
2. heat resistor, 4.7 ohm - 4.50
3. budaschnozzle 2.0 threaded extension ( sadly out of stock ) - 11.00
4. budaschnozzle 2.0 heater block - 15.00

i salvaged all other parts of the hotend minus the tube, heater block, which is also chemically welded to the tube and the nozzle which has part of the tube stuck in side of it.

i know they are supposed to be replaced every so often but this just seems a bit excessive with how this thing welded together. looking for ways to prevent this going forward.

right now i know the printer works because i installed my flexy dually head and it is printing just fine. i was hoping that i was not going to need to use this head right away as it was for another project but tight now it is the only head i have that works.

its at lest a semi not so expensive fix but i want to know for the future what i can do to keep this thing going as long as possible.","i am sorry to see about the budaschnozzle! i do have a couple suggestions that may help the longevity of the hotend.

the 4.7ohm is originally designed to change current and voltage within electronics. as a by-product they will produce heat. as they are never designed to generate heat, they will fail from time to time. we stay true to our reprap roots by using these, as they are fairly easy to come by and inexpensive (~$1.00 each when purchased through digikey or mouser.) directions on replacing the resistor are here.

the threaded extension and nozzle tip need to be heated before attempting to remove. filament can get between the threads, acting like cement when cold. we recommend heating to 160c-180c, then turning off the printer before attempting to remove the nozzle. this allows the filament to be molten enough to be removed. if you heat higher than this, you can cause the aluminum extension and nozzle to expand so much they will seize and be impossible to remove.

i hope this helps!"
nozzle change,"on my new to me taz 5 i had to change out the nozzle to a new size. i was kind of dreading after reading all the concerns on here.  nothing to it. heated the nozzle to the filament temperature, applied two wrenches and removed. turned off the nozzle heater, unscrewed.nozzle...  used my very thin gloves used for when i tig weld, it was still a little toasty on the fingers, started the threads by hand and snugged it tight with the wrenches.  no thread sealer or locktite blue and it tested fine with no leaks.",gotta love lamb skin tig gloves.
hot end jam - filament really stuck.,"hi,

new taz 5 owner, 0.5mm hot end option,  been printing 3mm pla flawlessly for a week or so.  last night hot end clogged.

i tried extracting the filament manually (hot end at 205) but it's completely jammed.  the filament just wont budge.

how much force is it safe to use to try and pull the filament out ? 

is it feasible to dismantle the hot end  to try and clear it ? 

rob","sounds like the pla may have swelled in the hotend from heat creep...  how much of the filament is still in the extruder?  any chance you can heat the hotend up past the pla temp and push a bit of the filament through?  just need to push maybe 10-20mm through the nozzle to clear the swollen filament, and then you should be able to pull the filament out.  

other option is to heat up the hotend, remove the nozzle and push the filament through...  i don't think lb supports this, but its fairly easy to pull the nozzle off.  heat the hotend past 165c, use a wrench to hold the heater block and another wrench to unscrew the nozzle.  to reinstall, heat the hotend past 165c and finger thread the nozzle... then wrenches to tighten at a hotend temp of 250c.  keep in mind the brass nozzle is soft, so make sure not to damage the thread.

the root cause of this may be a bad heatsink fan.  check that its running and make sure to point it down a bit so the air is hitting the thicker heatsink near the heat break.

you're on the right path in contacting support.


on another note, clamping forceps help with gripping the filament if its past the hobbed bolt.  undo the idler, grip/clamp the filament, heat up the hotend, and pull on the forceps.  great for when the filament spool runs out..."
taz 4 z axis height issues,"i am looking for some community input as i have basically exhausted all my known resources to fix this issue.

ok so i printed 3 versions of the rocktopus.

here were my steps so you can follow along and help out because i know there is an issue somewhere.

1. i downloaded your model above
2. i went into cura 15.02.1-1.03 and in the menu went to expert switch to quick print and choose fast.

saved this as gcode and put it on the sd card to put into printer
pre heated printer to 230 abs and 105 bed. 105 is the only temperature so far i can get proper adhesion.

started my first print.

1. the first one. the bottom layer didn't adhere as well so it failed when one arm popped off the bed so i stopped the print. otherwise it looked to have great adhesion on first layer.

next i said let me download the cura profile so i went to here to get the right profile.

https://www.lulzbot.com/support/taz-cura-profiles


i choose

taz abs profiles
taz 1-4 recommended temperatures:   extruder: 230°c   bed: 85°c   part removal: 50°c


and downloaded the fast profile

fast, 0.28 mm layers


then in cura i opened profile.

then i re saved the g-code to the sd card and printed again.


this third print did as well print.


here is where the wheels fall off.


i opened the rocktopus_v1.9 inside of netfabb to get the exact dimensions so i can check compared to the real print it shows me that length is 146.57 width is 148 and height is 47.17.

i will come back to this a bit later.






this was print 1 and how it failed - that's ok prints fail although i am not quite sure why it failed.






print #2. completed but didn't look right. in the z axis






print #3. completed again looked even worse, i assume it was because it was on fast. but the z layer height was still not quite there.

using part 2 and  3. i started to measure it compared to size i saw in netfabb above.

x  accuracy is right on.






y accuracy is right on.






z height however. is off by almost 50%




","z steps per milimeter is a measurement of how many motor steps it takes to move the motion axis 1 milimeter. under the taz 3 and below, the threaded rod actual thread pitch and rod diameter is significantly different than the thread pitch and rod diameter of the leadscrew. the motor is the same. in order to move the more accurate leadscrew axis 1mm, you have to turn it twice as far (mainly because the rod is much wider), hence the larger number. that is set inside the configuration.h firmware file inside the firmware package itself. your firmware was showing 4.1, but it has the old value. which is wierd. but someone else ran into that same issue in the forum. they fixed it by uploading a different firmware. my guess is that at least one of those downloadable firmware packages for 4.1 on cura has an incorrect value in it somewhere. not many people are going to upgrade the firmware on a 4, and cura was introduced more towards the 5 so probably not a whole lot of 4 owners are using it."
stand ideas for taz 5,"we just purchased a taz 5 for work and now i'm trying to figure out where to put it.  i had originally thought it was going in the shop which is down the road but our engineering manager and president both want it in the office so now i need to get something to set it on.  

will a rolling toolbox be stable enough with the wheels locked or do i need to set up a stationary workbench?
if we put it in an office area with cubical walls will it be disruptively loud or smelly when running?
we are not sure what materials we will be using, planning on abs at first, should we plan on needing to build an enclosure to get good parts?","i am currently building an enclosure for my taz.  the inside dimensions i am using are 24"" wide, 26 1/2"" deep and 21"" tall.  with these dimensions, i am cutting out a square hole for the control box face, and will have to mount the power supply, reel, filament guide and guide tube on the outside of the box.  the box will just clear the movement of the build platform.  the width just clears the frame with the hole cut for the front of the control box.  the height clears the top of the frame by less than an inch.

for general clearance, i would say 27"" depth x 36"" - 40"" wide  x 28"" tall would be reasonable.

considering a taz 5,"after about a year of printing on my printrbot, i've started to feel the ""urge"" to upgrade to something faster/larger, with better support for different materials. that, and my printrbot has been down for 3+ weeks and i haven't been able to get it fixed - and received very little useful support from printrbot's ""support"" team.

 i've been largely comparing the taz 5 and the makergear m2, and heavily leaning towards the taz 5. i've been doing a lot of research, but i still have a few questions.

first, i'm curious about things like print speed. since i don't really have a basis of comparison (altho the printrbot seems awfully slow), about how quickly can a taz 5 print something like this, at a layer height of about .2mm or so? 

https://www.youmagine.com/designs/print ... der-shroud

and i guess a secondary question related to speed is - how ""typical"" is that kind (.2mm) of layer height? that's usually about where i print to get the best time/speed ratio. i can do down to .1mm, but it takes a really long time, and i also have to significantly slow down the print speed.

second, in the 3d hubs review of the taz 4, they make a comment about small intricate objects not printing very well. that seems like a rather vague statement, and i was wondering what the typical community experience is with this? also, is this something that's been improved in the taz 5 over the 4? from what i've been able to tell, the 5's only key difference is the hot end

third, how difficult is it to keep the print surface level? i'm so accustomed to having an auto-leveling probe that it concerns me that i would have to re-level the bed frequently.

finally, how well do the taz series printers (and i realize the 5 has only been out for a few months) stand up over time? do they break down frequently, or are they (general maintenance aside) relatively trouble free? i don't mind tinkering, adjusting, and making updates to my printer (i've done a lot of that), but i don't want to get into another printer that i end up spending days and days trying to debug without making any progress.

thanks everyone!","i came from a printrbot simple metal.  similarly, i wanted a bigger print bed and wanted something ""industrial"" to be my last fdm printer.

the taz 5 won't disappoint.  the 2020 extrusion construction is sturdy.  the connecters into the control box are solid.  my machine has had a few clogs, but its been reliable and easy to maintain 

the induction autolevel was missed at first. and th bed leveling was daunting and there was a short learning curve.  the key is to use dial gauges for quantitative feedback and the z-offset g-code parameter (which is similar to the m212 z##) in slicing software. easy enough when using dial gauges for quantitative feedback.  once the bed is level, you shouldn't have to touch it for a while... the key is model removal and a good nozzle to bed distance (hence the software z-offset).

3d printing is slow period. larger bed usually equlas larger objects equals long print times. the taz can print fast, i regularly print at 90mm/s at .3 layer height.  as long as the outermost perimeter is set to a 30-40mm/s speed the finished results are good.  

a layer height of .2 with the stock .35 nozzle is pretty common.  i personally like the .4 and .5 with a layer height of .2-.3 for the majority of my parta..  the .35 goes on for delicate / intricate prints... for best results printed at 60-80mm/s again with the perimeter at 30mm/s.

the common obstacle with both printers is the lack of enclosure.  the pei print surface works really well with abs and pla.  the 24v heated bed and hotend make a huge difference (~7-8min preheat vs. 10+ on the psm's 12v).  the 24v heated bed is much superior to the psm's 12v variety.

i really liked pb's compact direct drive extruder, but the wades seems bulletproof.  the ability to quickly swap out toolheads is nice.  i hope to have a variety of toolheads dedicated to each type of material, and possibly other toolheads with varying nozzles.  the other nice thing about the wades extruder is printing replacement parts if they break.  which leads me to lbs open-source philosophy, similar to pbs.

you'll have no issues with intricate and/or delicate models... just slow the machine down as necessary, and dial in your slicing software ( i use s3d on both machines for great results).


overall, i've been really happy with the taz.  incorporating technologies from both companies could result in a killer pinter... dual compact direct drive toolheads, capacitance autolevel probe, sturdy frame, large form factor bed, pei, 24v, quick change toolheads... rumba/smoothie controller capable of controlling 3 hotends."

printing taz3 to taz5 upgrade parts with a lulzmini?,"hello all,

 i don't have access to a cad program at this time and ive had the question as to if all the parts needed to upgrade a taz3 to a taz5 could be printed on the lulzbot mini? are all the taz 5 printed parts small enough to fit within the mini's build volume of (6in x 6in x 6.2in)

thanks all, i await your responses","the only one you can't print is the stock metal x to z axis plates. there is however a printable modification that stiffens and thickens that part and merges it with the stock style motor and idler pieces to create a stiff enough assembly that can be printed. everything else you can print or source. the leadscrews are the other tricky bit to get ahold of. there are some ""how to"" guides, and that x to z axis piece shown in the ""comprehensive taz modification sticky thread. expect to run a few electrical cables as well, specifically at least the one for the required hexagon cooling fan."
"feeder failure, unable to complete first print.","i have just unpacked and finished calibrating taz 4 from lulzbot. so far after laying out few lines the feeding chamber above the nozzle becomes jammed and no plastic is coming out. i have tried tweaking with all the settings but have not had any success. the filament i am using is abs, 1.75 and i was trying to print the standard octopus using printrun. the strands twist and curl like on the photo which i have came across here as well. because printer has barely been used i don't think it needs inside of the nozzle checked. i do not know how to fix that issue except for maybe buying different polymers to see the comparison or different filament thickness. thanks for help.","it is that 1.75mm filament that will be giving you the issues. the taz printers are designed to use 3mm filament. the smaller filament allows for too much room in the hotend/extruder and allows it to buckle as shown in your photos. if you want to use 1.75mm filament consistently and successfully, you are going to need to do a modification like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epcxtorf1z8

new taz 5 owner. what kind of advice can you give me?,"like the title says. i have a taz 5 coming and i'm hoping it'll be as nice if not nicer than my current printer which is a robo 3d r1 that has been working flawlessly since day one. what kind of newbie tips can you guys and gals give me when my printer arrives tomorrow?

any helpful tips or advice will be appreciated.","lets see, get a good part removal tool, and always remove parts gently if possible. i use a cheese slicer for this actually, and it works great. for printing abs, use 240c for the nozzle starting temperature and 92c for the bed temperature. check and level everything before you start printing. also make extra sure to measure the filament you are using and imput that into your sliceing software to ensure you aren't over or underextruding. 

if you switch from abs to pla, note that abs melts at a higher temperature so if there is any left in the nozzle when you switch, you may have to purge some plastic at a higher temperature rather to clear it out. 

buy good filament. cheap filament and working filament aren't always the same thing. the cheap stuff often has filler in it, like chalk or melamine powder that messes with your printer. 

a jam is almost never due to an actual blockage. if your filament is stripping on the hobbed bolt you are either too close to the bed, or the idler arm springs aren't tight enough. you want to start with around 8mm between the two washers on either side of the spring to start with. more for abs possibly. 

get a good set of digital calipers and use them constantly. 

if you ever have a layer that just shifts in one direction randomly for no apperent reason, you either have a loose belt or a loose pulley setscrew. 

if you are going to level the bed, always do so when the printer is at full printing temperature and has been there for a few minutes. the hot end expands when heated a bit. to level the bed, i use a thin metal depth gauge (one may have came with your taz) and i use that to set an equil space between the hot end and the bed at all for corners. it's more important to get the bed level first,  and then set the layer height. a stock taz will have an apperent minor dip in the middle if you are using a dial indicator. you can ignore that for now. the glass actually is flat though. 

hmm, lets see what else. oh, never move the bed or the heat end by yourself without first disconnecting the motor cables. causing the motor to turn without them disconnected turns them into a generator, and basically feeds power back into the controller which can damage the small fuses inside. they look like tiny grains of rice, and are not fun to replace.

trying to diagnose a printing problem,"i recently got a taz 5 and i'm experiencing a printing problem, and i can't seem to find anything else like it by searching online. after the first one or two layers the nozzle seems to deposit little blobs of excess material at the interior edges of the part where the nozzle changes directions to make another diagonal pass to complete a layer. this creates bumps that are high enough that the nozzle will hit them the next time it passes. the belts seem fairly tight and i cant find anything else that's loose. i'm using cura as the slicer and ic3d abs filament. i'm not sure where to start and any help would be greatly appreciated.","typically when the toolhead moves from one spot to another without printing, the filament will retract a bit to prevent ooze (the retraction creates a suction).  it sounds like you need to increase the retraction.

could also be overextrusion too.  decrease the flow multiplier to .93-.95.  this actually makes sense since most filament is 2.85mm while the slicer is set to a 3mm filament... do the math and most machines set to 3mm filament are overextruding.  well... i should take a step back, if you've got calipers sample the diameter of your filament.

lastly, make sure the nozzle is clean.  filament stuck to the nozzle could track material around and cause the prints to be less accurate.

hope those ideas help!"

i am a guy with 2 jobs, a wife,  and a 4 year old. i can tinker with the best of them but time is valuable so that's part of a lean towards the mini. it's automated cleaning, leveling,  and general less finicky nature is appealing. on the other end i may eventually want to print large props and cosplay pieces so the larger print bed is very appealing with the 3 as well as the ability to do upgrades like duel extruding.

i'm stumped and would appreciate any owners of either comments or just general advice on pros cons and what you might do. thanks for any advice!","the mini would probably be a little better initially, but just incrementally and you would be limited to the size. you can ignore the auto leveling in making your decision really. the taz might take a bit to level once, but once it is leveled you won't have to move it much. the leadscrews can be sourced from mitsumi. the part number is in the forum somewhere, there should be a link containing it inside the stickied taz modification thread down at the bottom under the ""upgradeing a taz 3 to a taz 5"" post. the process involves printing several pieces, some wiring, a firmware update and about $90 worth of hardware (the leaadscrews are about $40 each if i remember right, and that's not counting the metal plates) it took me about a day to upgrade mine, but i was lucky enough to source the metal plates from a former poster here who was selling a limited number of them.  

if someone gave me the choice, i would probably pick the taz, but i really like to tinker with things so i might not be the best role model to help you make that decision heh.

edit: here is the 5 hotend. you would need to do the wiring and print the necessary parts, but that would give you the same print head as the 5 or the mini. you would need to do some firmware tinkering if you still had the 3 style threaded rod, but it would be doable.

taz 3 fan/hot end,"looking for help from the community, lulzbot doesn't return any of my emails so i need your guys help. i have a stock taz 3 i recently orderd a extruder fan for it, 24 volt. thinking i was ready to rock and roll with it. i found out that i needed a te connectivity / buchanan for it to connect to the motherboard, didn't get one with the fan. im guessing the the things on the end slide into the te connectivity correct. ordered one of those from a supply. so im guesing im good there. also does the budaschnozzle 2.0c w/ 0.5mm nozzle work on a taz 3. thanks for your help","a taz 3 has a buddaschnozzle 2.0c hotend on it. to change nozzle sizes all you have to do is adjust the settings in your slicer to the larger nozzle size. usually that involves changing the nozzle size itself, and then changing the layer height to make use of the larger nozzle. my general utility 0.5mm printing settings are 0.5mm nozzle diameter, 0.4mm starting layer height and 0.3mm layer height for all other layers. there are no firmware changes required unless you upgrade to the hexagon style hotend."
taz 5 leveling always?,"i have a taz mini and i love it.  thinking about larger projects now and want to either get a 5 or maybe a 6 if they are in the near future.  

   i see a lot of issues posted with the taz5 and the need to re-level.  so if the machine is mounted or placed on a solid surface and leveled, (which i understand is a 45 minute process)  it needs to be re leveled again for next use?

 i also see lots of issues with nozzle clogging's.  on amazon where i purchase my share of things, the reviews on the taz5 are not that good. i realize that some of those reviewers would have problems putting air in a bicycle tire, but some are who i would consider power users.  they gave up on the machine and returned. 

is part of the leveling problem related to a less than study design and construction?","the levelness of the bed and the nozzle height are different things.     both are easy to set and generally stay set once done... though i'm always evaluating the first layer adhesion and adjusting the nozzle height or z-offset as necessary.

the nozzle height is adjusted through the z-endstop knob.  its a mecahnical, lever endstop that defines the end of travel for the z axis... probably something similar on cnc machines.  the top of the knob is the contact point, rotating adjust the height.  set after leveling the bed... i use a business card as a feeler:
- move the hotend to center of the print bed
- heat up the the hotend to extrusion temps
- z-home the toolhead
- slide the business card between the bed and nozzle
- small turn of the z-endstop knob to adjust up or down
- re-home and repeat last few steps until business card slides through

pretty simple once you get the hang of it...  not necessary for every print.  

as mentioned in the other post, most of the time the levelness of the bed is upset when pulling or prying the finished print off the bed.  

i'm a fan of the ""no-touch"" inductive / capacitive based leveling.  a few members of the community have accomplished this on the taz.  just requires a bracket to hold the probe and connecting to the z-endstop lead."
wire came out of the extruder,"





the smaller black wire came out of the extruder..
it pulled out of the insulation, and inbetween said wire and said extruder is a little clear tube i assume the wire goes in. how is this all supposed to go together?

assuming the picture pulls up, a is my wire, b is the clear tubing, and c is the insulation on the sister wire.","that little tube can withstand high temperatures and it's on the thermister and keeps the 2 wires from shorting out. the thermister is the device that tells the board how hot the heater block is.

the wires are crimped together as solder would melt. so you need to find a crimp connector and hook both wires back up properly. if this is not done properly your printer will show the wrong temperature and could overheat and even catch fire. if you are not familiar with doing this you need to find a friend to do it or maybe contact lulzbot and see if they will sell you one with the wires connected already.

the small solid wires on the thermister do not like being bent and they will snap if too much bending is done and this is likely what happened to yours.

oh, and the thermisted is just shoved into that hole, you will likely be best to remove it and undo the plug on the other end so you can lay it out to fix it.

this is what is inside the hole https://www.lulzbot.com/products/100k-epcos-thermistor"
taz 4 vs taz 5?,"unfortunately i had send back my taz 5 due to a problem with the nozzle (i would have preferred a new nozzle rather than re-boxing the whole thing, but hey!)

now the refund has been processed, it turns out the taz 5 is now out of stock from amazon uk, so i'm wondering whether i should go for the taz 4 instead. is there any compelling reason i should wait for the taz 5 to come back in stock? it seems as if quite a few people have had problems with the hexagon extruder, and i can always upgrade in the future when the next innovation comes along, right?

the thoughts of more experienced lulzbot users would be much appreciated. thanks in advance!","the pei bed alone is worth the wait.

i had a taz 4 and essentially upgraded it to a taz 5 by adding the pei and buying a new v2 all metal hotend. its 100% doable and 100% worth it but it does take some extra money and time meticulously laying out the pei to ensure no air bubbles get trapped underneath it. waiting for a taz 5 to be in stock is probably worth it.

nopick makes a good point about calling lulzbot sales to inquire after other places that may have stock available. they are incredibly helpful every time i call."
taz 5 not powering on.,"hello all, i've run into yet another issue with my taz5.  i was getting ready to recalibrate the print bed.  i noticed some left over abs on the nozzle that the brush couldn't get off, so i heated it to 240 and scrubbed it off.  i went to extrude some filament to make sure that any gunk left in there will be removed.  after this, it just turned off.  no lcd, nothing.

the power supply still has the green light.  i've tried unplugging it from both ends and letting it sit for a bit, and then plugging both ends back in, but nothing.   when i plug the machine into my pc it recognizes the ""3d printer powered by rambo"".  i'm dumbfounded.  any help would be appreciated.","i think you're right.  the 15amp fuse is ok, but the very small ones that look like they're by the thermistor connectors(?) get no response from my multimeter.  the motor fuse and the hotend fuse?


http://reprap.org/mediawiki/images/b/b4 ... -fuses.jpg
it appears to be the fuse 'f3' in the image above

z axis moves are inconsistent,"i've been having problems with he z axis lately. i first noticed the issue when the two side were unmatched enough to bind. i leveled them and thought all was ok except a little overextrusion. while watching closely as a small disk grew ib height  i noticed the z  axis motors moved in inconsistent amount. the layer size was set to 0.15 mm. normal movement seemed to be about 10 degrees of motor rotation, but every second or third layer increase was either no rotation, or maybe 5 degrees, 

i have searched the website and the web and haven't seen anyone else mention this behavior. i've loosed every mounting bolt holding the z rods in place but it still seems to skip or understep every other layer. a larger layer height misses much less. is there an optimal ""step"" amount the the motors and or controller like better? i'm also wondering if it's a rounding problem in the firmware. 

i'm new to stepper controllers so it will take a while to figure out how many steps are needed for various heights, then try those out in the slicer. if someone has any insight please let me know. fine printed objects are much poorer in quality than fast prints because the faster print doesnt miss every other step.



 i'm using a reprap hexagon hot end with a .40 nozzle on my taz5 , getting ready to convert to bowden for  dual extruders becasue the flexydually is simplly too heavy and poorly balanced. ideally one extruder on each side of the x axis rods might work better any weight not being pushed around constanty has to be better. at least with abs and a 20mm fan and shroud on the hex fins keeps the filiment cool going into the hotend so a bowden setup should be ok.","in an effort to better monitor the z axis i changed the code in dogm_lcd_implementation.h to print two decimal places for the z axis. around line 322

 u8g.drawpixel(89,35);
 u8g.setprintpos(90,37);  // dgp  want to see more digits
 u8g.print(ftostr32(current_position[z_axis]));


this shows somewhat unexpected values for z not normal increases of the z hop distance added to a multiple of layer height.  i think this is because the z axis is sometimes in the middle of a move when the screen update is triggered, but the z axis steppers are definiftely not keeping up with the movements, often ending up against the print bed as the z hop up wards steps are skipped but the downward hops are performed. i;ll call support tomorrow since no one else is seeing this. i can mininimize the missed steps by eliminating z hop on retract, but that leads to stringing on some prints, and i still miss random layers in a print. im thinking of ordering higher torque steppers as that seems to be the common fix for missed steps. i'm also going to get real linear rolloer bearings insteead of the printed plastic ones the come with the taz 5. for the price these should come stock. im pretty disappointed with the taz 5 right now, but this seems to be an issue with all reprap printers with no actual measurement of steps to verify they took place, but the consensus seems to be that with enough torque the steppers don't fail so adding hardware encoders isn't not worth the added cost since that doesn't save a print from failing if a step is missed. i'm not sure i agree and i may try adding encoders to the z axis at least to verify that correct height is being met."
fillament striping,"hi guys, so i got my lulzbot taz 5, new to 3d printer, first thing that i did was read the entire mhackney guide. 

leveled the bed with a gauge indicator, got the first layer as perfect i i thought it can be, but i'm having a problem.

the first tests that i did was with abs, got 3 prints perfect, the octopus, the mount for the gauge indicator and a spare herringbone gear, all cool.

then i switched to pla, because i wanted to print something bigger, and for what i read pla is more dimensional stable.

first layer perfect, 5 hour print, and my pla start striping, removed the filament, cleaned the hobbed bolt (without disassembling the extruder) as whell as i could, put the fillament back in, tightened the two screws that make pressure on the filament. few print hours, same thing. few hours of print, filament start stripping.

things that i noticed: 
- there is a small friction on the path of the filament between the hobbet bolt and the extruder, exactly when the metal part meets the plastic one, the filament need to be pushed on the correct angle, once is passed that small gap i can feel any friction.
- once and i while i can hear a small ""click"" that i'm almost sure that is the hobbet bolt slipping.
- it looks like the hobbet bolt is not perpendicular with the herringbone gear, doesn't it? check the pictures.

i'm not sure what i need to do now, disassemble the extruder? clean everything and try again?

first test was default fast settings for cura and pla on taz 5. second test i increased 5 degrees on both the extruder and the heated bed.","hi everyone!... i'd like to share my experience if i may in the hopes that perhaps someone can also help me with an exact problem i am having with my taz 5... i've had mine for just over a week now and i must say it's been very challenging so far with 95% failed prints... my taz could not even finish the first octopus test print... at the beginning i didn't lose heart since having been a user of makerbot replicator 2 and 2x for the last year and half years so i am not unfamiliar with the the nitty gritty gorilla warfare that is desktop fdm 3d printing... so these early failures with the initial octopus test print i put it down to beginner's learning curve... but after mastering bed leveling, z height and good 1st layer i quickly moved onto what i had originally purchased this printer for- to print some prototypes of my product design ideas (these are large prints 10.5"" x 10"" x 3"")... but again and again the prints were fails to my utter dismay  

just some of my of tries



 large print fails 


fast forward 72hrs
while these were printing with various settings and tweaks (brim, raft, z height, filament thickness, temperatures etc) i read up as much as i could in the forums on ""filament striping/grinding/chewing"" and i stared to deduct that perhaps it maybe something to do with this issue called ""heat creep"" and so i placed a 6"" desk fan directly blowing onto towards the hot end heat sinks while the printer was printing...

day 5
i began to make some progress in the fact that the prints went further along... so encouraged by this progress, i ordered a small blower fan to rig up air flow to the heat sinks as others have done with funnel attachments etc. at this time i also contacted lulzbot for help and ray from their help desk was kind enough to reply promptly... he suggested i go back to the basic and just go with basic settings and print but with additional 5 degrees more heat in the extruder and the idle screws tighten down to 4mm between washers... unfortunately it resulted in a fail also



 1st layer looks great!... but fails again 


day 6
... but at this point i was pretty sure it had something to do with the ""heat creep"" issue so with the same settings suggested by ray i reprinted... but with the 6"" fan and low and behold it printed out!... so i repeated 2 more times, just for confirmation
success!



 6"" fan blowing air helps to complete prints (back row)... repeated test 3 times to confirm 


day 7
the blow fan arrived from amazon so i quickly made a temporary rig out of styrofoam and attached it to the front of extruder housing and directed air towards to heat sink... this setup is only working when the heated bed is not turned on... presumably the fan is just blowing hot air which is rising from the bed... i may have to flip the fan so that that air is being sucked from above.



 40mm blower fan rigged to blow air onto heat sink 


day 8
so far prints are doing ok although i haven't made long prints... however a new problem i hadn't really noticed before a couple days ago is this bumpiness i get on the print surface... have tried entering larger diameter in the filament size- upto 3mm... have tried less and more flow rate... different print speed, retraction and various height and shell thicknesses... no difference in the bumps/pimples effect although layer qualities were effected...



 surface bumps and pimples 


day 9
so that's my story so far... ray is not acknowledging the ""heat creep"" issue and have instead keep telling me to tighten the screws (increase feed pressure) and raise hotend temperature (decrease backpressure) but these combinations have not work without the fan so we will see what other ideas he has... i have also contacted the re-seller for help who have been very nice to see if they can give me a swap with another new taz 5 or even swap with a used perfectly working taz 5 from their office (they don't have any)... they also admitted that yes they have heard of similar issues and since this machine is a new release there could be some quality control issues with parts... so if tonight's more test prints are not addressing the 1) the ""heat creep"" issue and 2) bumpy surface issues then i am going to either take up on the swap offer of a new machine or ask for my money back depending on how frustrated i feel... oh and i have also ordered the type a machines series 1 to see how that one will work out... i truly hope it will be a better experience... i just want it to work... no fans no tweaks no messing with this and that!... at least if nothing else my old faithful replicator 2 was a joy to use!... and that's saying something! if anyone has any remedies/ideas please i would be eternally grateful, thank you in advance and apologies for the diatribe and length..."
taz 5 nozzle clog,"hi all,

i've just received my brand new taz 5 and successfully printed a nice little rocktopus using the provided filament sample.

since i didn't have a proper 3mm filament at the time, i stupidly enough decided to use some 1.75mm poor quality white abs filament i had lying around.
i managed to somehow feed it, up until the point when the entire leftover green filament was extruded, but now it is clogged and won't extrude.

i tried to pull the material out, but the filament broke and now i can't even get a proper grab of it.
i also tried to manually extrude some fair esun 3mm yellow abs filament at 240, but the hobbing just grinds the material and the white filament won't be pushed down.
i'm afraid that raising to 240 was too high for the white filament, causing it to bulk and block the nozzle. does it make any sense?   

can someone please help?  ","ok, issue resolved!   

the hotend was extremely hard to get out of the extruder mount, because pieces of filament were stuck all through.
however, some really hard pulling did the trick.
not only the white pieces of filament were inside, but leftovers from the sample abs as well.

i'm attaching some photos, in case it may be useful for someone.

thank you, nopick!"
v2 dually nozzle from 2 single tool heads,"so i just had a crazy thought...  purchase a second v2 single tool head, print all the plastic parts, combine, and have a dually for $175 ish.  after some cursory research, it seems as everything will work.  i'm going to have to source the screw on connector that fits the electronics housing, a few molex plugs, and 4 heat set nuts for the fans to mount into.  other then that, i should be able to scavenge everything else from the tool head that ships with the taz, and the other single toolhead.

i'm going to look more into this this weekend.   surely someone has tried this before, right?","ok, fw is out of my wheelhouse.  i would have to have someone help me make the changes and compile it.  i've also noticed there seems to be no provision for heat sync fans on the current dually files, or a way to mount the filament cooling fan on the secondary extruder."
taz4/5 system level cad layout,"i'm looking to do some work on an enclosure and i was hoping someone could share their 3d cad solid models (iges, .igs, or step, .stp) of a taz4/5 at the very top level.  i want to have a top level layout including all the frame members, y table, z climber, rambo enclosure, etc.  does this exist anywhere?  i have looked for it on aleph objects' site without success.  i'd be happy to share as i make improvements and fill in any gaps in the solid models.
tia and keep printing.

taz 5 - first print nozzle problem,"very excited to start experimenting with our new taz 5. assembled it, levelled the bed, and followed all the other setup instructions in the user manual. once everything was calibrated, i got the printer up to temperature and inserted the abs sample provided. almost immediately, the filament started to leak from above the nozzle, as you can see from the pic attached. the abs that did come through the nozzle correctly applied just fine to the bed, but most seems to be melting and oozing out of the side, as you can see. i re-read the manual and instructions, and trawled through these forums for suggestions, but i'm not sure what to try. any ideas would be very welcome! thank you","it is possible your nozzle has a crack. my first mini nozzle actually broke off during a print... that was a mess.

layer separation,"hi everyone,

any ideas on what would cause layer separation as seen in the picture? the issue was just on one side and occurred during an attempt to use hips as support for abs. (not much success so far)

i think the problem first occurred after the solid bottom layer so it might have something to do with the infill.

any ideas? thanks!

mark","most likely your cooling fan since it only blows on one side.

things to try:

1. in expert mode, turn off your cooling fan (this fixed my print experiencing similar issues.

2. experiment with part orientation on the bed.

3. put an enclosure over your printer to reduce the temperature gradient

4. use thinner layers

help with octoprint set up,"hey all, i'm finally getting back to trying to set up my raspberry pi with octoprint.  i am new to ripi and octoprint. 

a quick update on my previous attempt to set up octoprint onto my new raspberry pi.   i previously tried to get octoprint set up and it seams something was going wrong with writing the octoprint image to the sd card. maybe im doing something wrong when formatting the card or it is getting corrupted when writing the image. i tried many many times with the same results, major issues with network function.  so to make sure it was not a hardware issue with the rpi itself i had the company i bought it from send me a new sd card with the standard os preinstalled on it.  everything is fine with the hardware.  i can boot the rpi normally, get to the gui, get on the internet, etc. so all is fine.

taz 5 not maintaining hot end temperature,"i've had an issue with my taz 5 over the past week where it has not maintained a steady print temperature. this seems to be an issue no matter the model that i'm printing or the material (tried abs and pla). the temperature is swinging wildly (20 degrees in either direction) within a couple seconds. do i just need a new thermistor maybe?

z-axis threaded pole misalignment causing motor jam,"this is a repost because i accidentally put this in the development section:

hi there, ran into the issue with my new taz 5.  the problem was easily fixed after some troubleshooting, but i figured would share this, as it has the potential to damage the unit (probably):

the problem:

uneven z-position on extruder bar anchor points.

details:
the extruder position on each of the two threaded rods that are driven by the z-axis stepper motors became unaligned.  this was strange to me when it occurred.  it happened mid-print early in the process (first 5 minutes).  i noticed because of the loud straining sound of a motor locked up - the z axis stepper motors could no longer turn (and were trying) because the height disparity on the thread bearings for the carriage support rods.  this was even more strange to me because i had meticulously calibrated my bed z-axis stopper, bed level, and x-axis carrier level prior to my first print and had actually double checked (with the supplied ruler) that my bed was still squared up to the carriage rods (that is what i call them, the support rods for the extruder to ride along for x-axis movement).

the fix:
i immediately turned off the taz5 when i heard the sound.  it took me a bit to diagnose the issue because the carriage rods were not that far from horizontal.  when i finally noticed this, i unbolted the right side mounting plate (the plate with the four bolts in a square pattern) from the thread-riding bearing/nut unit.  i then manually turned the right most threaded rod until the carriage rods were about square/level to the bed.  i did fine-tuning with the ruler so that the heights on both sides of the rods were within 0.5mm of each other.   the printer has been doing a lot of work ever since and the issue has not reappeared.

the cause
my guess is that either the stepper motors came out of sync, or one of the stepper motors is not securely fastened to its threaded rod.  but since the problem has not happened again i'm at a bit of a loss.  i thought maybe someone here might have experienced this or have other ideas for the cause?  my biggest fear with this issue is that if it occurs when away from the printer it could warp/bend the carriage support rods, given sufficient time, strain, and temperature.","i am having this, or a similar issue. i had just tried to level the bed an ran out of adjustment range on the right side. i started a print and could hear the left motor trying to step by it wasn't moving. i think it its microstepping then , because raiisning it 1 mm works fine. ill revel and try loosening the screws. i did tighten every bolt on it last week."
taz1 fine tuning,"i have a taz1 here at work that i've been trying to get dialed-in.  this machine has been unknowingly abused and it's taken some time to get it back to a usable state.  (we also have a taz5 and it's printing beautifully)  

i'm fighting what i believe is a retraction issue.  here's a screengrab of how the nozzle traverses the part: 


here's an overview of the part as it was completed: 


and a couple of close-ups of the defects: 




what i believe is causing these artifacts is a little bit of melted filament being wiped onto the 
inside wall when the nozzle passes over.  i've tried retraction settings ranging from .5 to 2.0.  the above 
was printed with retraction set at 1.0  if i add more retraction i get voids in the print immediately following the retraction, any less retraction and the artifacts are larger. 

i'm printing lulzbot abs at 235 nozzle and 87 bed, .1mm layer height and ""fine"" defaults from simplify3d

all comments are welcome as i could be completely misdiagnosing the issue altogether.   (looking closely at
the photos it appears it's under-extruding a tad, i'll check the extrusion calibration) 

sorry for the un-centered photos, click on them for a larger view.  i couldn't figure out how to scale/center them... 

thanks in advance!","piercet wrote:
thats an unusual one. it definitly looks like a bit of underextruding, but that shouldn't be causing the extra plastic loops. from the print image i can see it's entering the new layers right around those 4 points, so it probably is some sort of nozzle ooze related issue, which would make sense that retraction affects it. thats a fairly large amount of material error right at that spot not to show up as effects anywhere else in the print though. 

the amount of material shown here is about the least i can get it down to before it starts skipping.  i watched it print many time and it's a bit of ooze that's is indeed getting wiped onto the walls.  as the print progresses, the hotend passes through the ""gunk"" and eventually starts dragging it around and making a big mess... 

check the extruder out really well. is the small gear on the extruder motor locked down and tight on the motor shaft? is the large gear excessivly worn and or able to move on the hobbed bolt without actually rotating the hobbed bolt? a taz 1 had unsealed 608zz bearings in the extruder itself, check the idler arm bearing and the two bearings on the hobbed bolt and make sure they are still turning correctly and smoothly. it wouldn't be unusuall at all for any of those bearings to be putting excess resistance on the hobbed bolt. 

i recently printed new gears and there isn't much slack i can feel between the gears and nothing turns that shouldn't.  i'll check out the bearings. 

maybe check the hotend too. make sure the peek isolator is not melted or out of true in the bore, that everything is alligned and fillament isn't binding at the junction between the extruder and the hot end. you may also want to run some extruder calibrations and see if your e-steps is off at all. (http://www.instructables.com/id/how-to- ... d-printer/) 

i just swapped the hotend out and the problem lessened but it didn't go away.  the hotend that was on the printer had 
what looked like a longer barrel (part between the heat sync and actual hotend) and i theorized it was heating up extra material and therefore increasing ooze.  as mentioned it helped but didn't completely fix the problem.  i also checked the e-steps but the taz1 doesn't have a display and i didn't have the time/energy today to reflash.  fwiw, one extrusion measured 94mm, the other 98mm.  both should have been 100.  i measured 120mm from the top of the extruder, marked with tape, extruded 100mm and measured from the top of the extruder to the tape.  should have been 20mm, right?  one was 26, the other 22. 

you might also try upgrading the slic3r version you are using. if you are using the stock taz 1 software, that would have came with an older version that had some circle issues. 

i'm using simplify3d.  i'm going to try both cura and slicer to see if either make a difference.  if it does then i'll dissect the settings. 

it also looks like your belts might be slightly loose. it could just be the stl file, but the round area of the inside of what i am assuming is some sort of fan bracket looks slightly flat in segments, which can be an indication of a slightly loose belt.

i've checked the belts but they also may be worn, i'll give them a recheck and/or replace them, thanks! 

thanks for the feedback, i'll give this a look next week when i get back to work!

fried taz,"my taz 5 shorted out at the ceramic heater. the pi fuse is good, do i just need to replace the whole board, it looks like the pins are carrying the voltage directly which cant be good when shorted.","there are two very tiny fuses on the board that look like grains of rice with copper foil at each end. you likely fried one of those fuses. they are inexpensive and easy to replace, but be aware it is possible to grab part of the metal contact of the socket when extracting one and inadvertently pull out that section of the socket, ruining your day and your board. then you end up buying a new one and it is not fun."
diamond hotend,"has anyone had any experience with the diamond hotend. it is a 3 color hotend with minimal design.  i found this at http://reprap.me/front-page-show/diamond-hotend.html.  wondering if it produces good results, and how much work is involved incorporating it into my taz 4.","the diamond, the kracken, the e3d multi heads, all of them require 1 fairly major obsticle at this point: multiple extruder motors. a direct drive extruder starts to get really heavy after a dual motor setup. a triple would pretty much require a bowden setup to run. you also would need a triple extruder capable control board, or an expander module for the rambo. there are existing bowden mounts for the taz, and finding a place to stick 3 of them wouldn't be too hard. most of your challenges would be electrical, firmware, etc. also bowden setups can be picky and prone to slow reaction due to the amount of fillament in the pipe between the nozzle and the extruder itself. 

try a dual extruder. if you use that alot and get proficient with it, add a third one in and redesign everything."
astrosyn dampers - amazing!,"this weekend i did some upgrades on my taz 4 including a new pei bed and adding astrosyn dampers to the x and y axis stepper motors. all i can say is wow! i'd say the dampers cut the noise of the taz 4 in half. enough that i can sit next to the printer and tune it out while working on other things. its not silent but 100% reasonable now. best upgrade i've made in a long time.

i've done multiple prints with the dampers and accuracy seems the same as it was before the upgrade (fantastic). i made sure to tighten the belts well so the small flex in the dampers is negated. very happy with the upgrade and for the relatively low cost i would recommend these to everyone. i know others have mentioned these here but i just wanted to add my voice and experience to the mix.

i bought my dampers at ultibots if anyone is looking for a pair.","post a vid if you get a chance, would love to see it!"
ninjaflex and pva spool spacers for the taz spool arms,"these spacers keep the 0.75kg ninjaflex and the 0.5kg pva spools up snug to the frame of your lulzbot taz. this keeps the filament from getting wrapped around the lulzbot spool arm, which can cause a failed build. you can download the files and print them yourself from our thingiverse page here: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:929133

1/4 of my print messes up.,"i am trying to print the small herring bone gear for my taz 4 printer. i used the lulzbot gcode to print to of them. the first broke during a longer print. i have been saving the second one to print a higher quality gear. i took the stl file for the herring bone gear and added more infill and slowed the print down a bit. now whenever i print it whether i slow it down or not 1/4 of the print is flawed. whenever it gets to this one side it lifts, does not flow, and ruins the print.it is always in the same spot and i have calibrated several times thinking it was a calibration issue. 

","the other prints seem to be doing just fine. it is this specific print. i used the gcode for the first initial print which was for two herring bones. the first broke fairly quickly so i have been saving the second for getting another good high quality herring bone printed. 

i did download the stl file and i am using the fine settings provided by lulzbot. each print comes out looking almost the same with this one side looking flawed. since then the only changes i made were to include fan usage and to slow the print slightly. i thought this might solve the issue but it doesn't look like it helped."

upgrades for the taz 5.,"other than the dual heads, are there any 3rd party upgrades for the taz 5?  

i know aleph is working on auto bed leaving but are there any 3rd party kits for this .  

also any thing to address the head free play issue.","here is what you need (assuming you are using windows):

1)  an sd card you are willing to overwrite.  i would make sure it is at least 4 gb.
2) sd card formatter program: https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter_4/
3) sd card image writer: http://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/
4) the octoprint image file (newest is jan 2015): http://mirror.tsone.net.uk/octopi/

put an sd card in, format it, use the win32diskimager to write the octopi image to it, put it in the rpi, and boot.  you will need a display and keyboard/mouse for your first boot and initial setup.

do the ""expand filesystem to fill full card"" option (#1 on the initial boot menu).  change the password away from ""raspberry"".  

boot.

if using wireless adapter: type in ""startx"", to get to the graphical user interface.  go to menu, settings, and click on ""wifi config"".  hit scan, find your ssid, type in your password, and connect.  the rpi will remember this network every time it boots.  shutdown, remove display, remove keyboard, plug in your taz, and voila!  it should work.

you access the interface by pointing a browser to ""octopi.local"".  you will then get a menu asking you to keep access control enabled (do this!), make a name and password to log in to the octopi console.

next, on the ""connect"" menu, select amc0, 115200 baud, check the boxes to make that happen automatically every boot, and hit connect.  it should work.  it if it doesn't, change amc0 to the other option you get.  

i've been using the octopi with great results for awhile now.  i would caution you to ensure you plug your 3d printer directly into a usb on the pi, and not into a hub.  for whatever reason, hubs sometime disconnect and reconnect, even if only for a second, but manage to ruin your print in the process.

fighting z wobble,"started noticing some moderate z wobble on my prints with my taz 5.

so far i've tried:
cleaning/lubricating the z screws
loosening/tightening the z steppers (after every adjustment have to align the x axis/re-level the bed)
checked for lose parts
tightened x belt
i noticed that the upright 80-20 is not quite vertical/square

things on my list to try:
printing cal cube at 45 degree angle
printing rectangle 8"" high to see if the z wobble is all the way to the top
try reseating the z steppers multiple times to get better alignment
go through the 80 20 upright frame to see if i can make it more square
replace the z screws/couplers

thoughts?  i looked back at some of the original prints that i did with the taz 5 and noticed some slight z wobble, the problem appears to be getting worse.  one of the z couplers was pretty obviously compensating for misalignment (bent) loosening the stepper and reseating it had no real effect.  

besides the cosmetic defect, really has effect on prints with two flat walls that are supposed to be in a flush assembly.","looks like you may have a little wobble in the pictures. try running the z_burnin_test code on the sd card, and as it travels up and down during the code execution look for side to side motion of the head/z-rods.

e3d v6 1.75mm mount,"hi all, 

in honour of this thread viewtopic.php?f=36&t=2378, i decided i'd add my own to the list as well. i converted to using 1.75mm filament which is easier to source for me but wasn't able to find a compatible 1.75mm e3d mount at the time. 

print it with taulman nylon (i use bridge) and also requires 2 m3x12mm screws and m3 heat inserts. the fit is intentionally near-zero tolerance around the hot end diameter so that once the screws are in it's going to be absolutely rock solid. for this reason, abs or other hard materials may not fit without fiddling around with the scaling a little bit or sanding down manually.","added it to the list, thanks!"
pico hot end on taz 5,"i tried to install a pico hotend on my single extruder and got the head to glow a nice cherry red. the pico hot end with a 12v heater and non functioning thermistor shoots lots of smoke from the nozzle   i also only get an adc count of 1019 so far. the thermistor may have been cooked along with several other print head parts. that was with pico;s updated thermistor for 500c . im stuck right now with no firmware for the flexydually and no hot end for the single extruder. the adc values were added to the m105 command by changes to configadv.h .and the thermistor profile to thermistortemps.h. i'll nake a post on proper changes when i can get a new thermisttor. with a 24v heater the hot end was melting abs but thermistor values were constant. are the thermistor leads 0-5v ? or do i need to compensate for 24v there too.

the flexydually insert says to go to ohai kit for installation and calibration quides, but of course they are not there. please change the insert to says use the dual extruder setup and modify it for taz 5.  i'm pretty good and i can't figure it out from available posts etc. i did find a posted .hex file for firmware but that is hard to modify ",i think i wired the termistor as a fan  
taz 5 and flexydually,what firmware am i supposed to use? i found taz 3 firmware but that cant be correct. do i just need to make the right changes in the config headers? i'm a developer so that is not a problem.. does the flexydually have 12v or 24v heaters?,i had a chance to play with it a bit more. the budaschnozle basically sucks. i have not yet got abs to stick. my taz 5 came with the hexagon hot end and prinpted almost out of the box. im going to upgrade both nozzles before trying anything else. there is simply no comparison to how much easier the hexagon hot end was to set up. the budas seem to need a much slower first layer than the taz 4 firmware was providing. i also picked up some generic kema nozzles and heater block to make up some hot ends with. after m elding the 4 and 5 firmware i'm going to use the 5 version with changes fore tthe second extruder. the flexydually lacks fan ducts so i'll need to print some.
gears jamming/clicking,"hi,

been noticing this issue during prints. it can go hours without doing it though. when it does, it's pretty bad.

already swapped out the small gear, same issue. large gear looks fine, no missing teeth.

any ideas?

thanks","piercet wrote:the extruder body, regardless of being a flexi-dualy or a regular one has an identical axle for the hobbed bolt. you should have 2 bearings alligned with one another coaxially with the hobbed bolt itself. the bolt, if not attached to the small gear on the stepper motor, should spin freely without resistance. the bearing sockets themselves can be fairly tight as long as they do not impede the rotation of the hobbed bolt. if they are too loose that can lead to allignment issuesthe socket might be slightly out of alignment (takes a lot of force to get the bearing in), but once the bearing is in the bolt appears to spin freely. i don't know how much resistance is appropriate.piercet wrote:either extruder body will actually print without any support. the regular extruder body doesn't need any heat set inserts, the flexi-dualy needs one on the tension screw side.good to know i can print that without supports. the body in question is in fact the flexystruder body, so if i have to go down this road, i'll need to obtain a replacement insert... and find access to a proper drill press.piercet wrote:check that all of your bearings are still good. it is possible you have a gummed up bearing that needs replacing. flexible fillament is also much slower printing than abs. you might be trying to print it too fast, with too much retraction, etc.the bearings appear to spin freely. i'm experiencing jams on ninjaflex... but i was using the slic3r profile for it from lulzbot, so i thought that the flow would already be defined. i'd agree that the jamming could easily be flow-related (ie, more filament goes in than what comes out). something to experiment with..."
taz 5  stops,"after 23 hours my print was ~98% complete when it stopped. this is the second time that i have printed this part and both times it stopped in the same spot around the same time frame. i have only had the printer for 2 weeks and have printed a bigger part.

taz 4 mod - extruder auto wipe like the taz mini,is there a way to implement the taz mini extruder wipe before it prints on a taz 4 or taz 5?,"wouldn't be too difficult...  try some brackets that slip onto the aluminum plate under the print bed.

but if you're just trying to get rid of the preheat ooze, a brim or skirt would ""clean"" the nozzle.  the skirt/brim basically traps most of the pre-extrusion ooze...

the skirt or brim comes with the added benefit of priming the nozzle with filament.  just make sure to extrude about 10-20mm to prime.

also found that if the nozzle height is adjusted correctly in the center of the bed, homing in the x0 y0 corner may also remove straggling ooze."
esteps calibration madness,"i've been having trouble with pla prints failing, and decided to try recalibration my machine's esteps.  problem is, it seems like the amount of filament extruded changes each time i attempt to extrude 100mm.  for example, i had esteps set at 908.0 for a few attempts.  the first attempt, it extruded 88mm.  second attempt, 95mm.  third attempt 94mm.  it just seems kind of random.  has anybody else run into this sort of thing while trying to calibrate esteps?  any ideas on what is going wrong?","update on this...

the print i was trying finally worked, and now i'm about about 10 hours into a 14 hour print with no problems at all.  best success i've had yet with pla, so now i'm feeling optimistic.

as for how i got it to work:

basically had to go through total destruction of one of my print heads to make progress.  i was using an ao hexagon hotend with a 0.4mm nozzle.  after going through numerous failed prints and trying all kinds of different adjustments, i decided to try the suggestion of dipping the filament in a bit of canola oil.  ouch big mistake, the hotend *immediately* started leaking huge amounts of plastic around the nozzle.  i mean huge globs pouring out the sides of the nozzle.  halted the print, cleaned up the mess, then tried to remove the nozzle.  the nozzle promptly snapped in half, leaving the nozzle threads stuck inside the hot end.  this was with very little torque while trying to remove the nozzle.  that was kind of a jaw dropping moment.

anyway, i had another brand new ao hex hotend, so i assembled that with a 0.5mm nozzle, and tried another print with these changes:
- tightened the idler bolts down real tight
- bumped down all the speed settings in slic3r to under 50
- printing at 205c
and viola, the 2-hour print that had been failing every time printed perfectly, and now the 14-hour one is almost done.

so, i'm not sure exactly which change did the trick, but my problem seems to be solved.

one thing i get from this is that using canola oil is probably a risky proposition.  i will *not* be trying that again.  i think if you are resorting to that, there is something else you are doing wrong.

second is that i suspect the ao hex hotends may have some quality control issues.  reason i say this is that with the first one i was using (that got destroyed), i noticed that it was consistently difficult to smoothly insert filament into the extruder and down into the hotend.  it would always feel like the filament was scraping against something in the hotend, and it alway felt like a rather tight fit.  adjusting the positioning of the hotend within the extruder did not seem to help.

however, with the second hotend that i'm now using, i see none of those issues.  the filament goes right down into the hotend with no resistance.  so perhaps all the issues i was having were just because that first hotend was a dud.

anyway, thanks for the suggestions folks, not sure what specifically did the trick, but problem solved."
thumb screws unscrewing,"hi... just got the taz5 about 1 1/2 weeks ago... i have been having a difficult time getting any jobs to complete before the filament gets stuck and stops advancing... 

after much trialing, i have discovered that the thumb screws are ever so slightly unscrewing which causes the hobbed nut to stop advancing the filament - which then becomes stripped... 

does anyone have an idea about how to fix this problem... lock tight / plumber's tape have both failed... i also noticed that the housing for the nuts poorly holds the nuts in place... they can easily be rotated... 

my test tonight was to every so often tighten the screws as it was printing... that solved the problem of having a job finish successfully... however, that was an hour of nursing... not a very tenable approach i would say.","well, i printed my ""problem part"" with lots of retractions in it today.  same settings as the last time i tried it.  this time the print completed, and the hobbed bolt showed only minor abs accumulation on it.  the two nuts didn't move during the test, and the distance between the compression washers was unchanged at 5.0 mm.  so i guess my problem isn't that, this time at least.

just prior to that i'd done a 5-hour print at a fairly slow speed on a group of three parts with few retractions and also had seen nothing moving or changing during that either.

since my nuts have two different orientations -- one with a hex point pointing straight up, and the other with a flat pointing straight up, it appears they can indeed rotate, but i sure couldn't make them do it today.

i do have strong suspicions that the loading-up of the hobbed bolt i often experience as part of my ""problem print"" failures are due to too-high extruding or retraction speeds, but i'll start another thread about that in a while and not hijack this one. 

sorry i couldn't duplicate the adjustment-loosening problem, but today at least it just didn't happen for me.

you might try putting a small shim of thin sheet metal down beside each of the two nuts, using brass shim material or aluminum flashing used on gutters, which can be cut with scissors, as a way to ensure they can't rotate.  one narrow strip, bent into a ""u"" shape flipped upside down, should take care of both nuts.  i'm thinking of doing that myself, just as insurance against any rotation there."

taking a look at the front view on the drawing in the upper left,
here is what the drawing describes.
 the 14.9 mm dimension on the left is the tangent point of the top of

those dimensions set the location of the arcs in the up and down

 the 2x 104.25 mm dimension in the middle of the bottom of the part is
the left to right location of the arcs.
 the two arcs don't actually share a center point vertically although

new taz5 user needs help,"word of disclaimer-- i'm coming from the world of using makerbot 2/2x's which, in my experience, worked absolutely great. i've consistently had 90-95% success rate on prints large & small for the last 2+ years.

now-- i'm learning the world of cura and i've gotten 1 successful print on 10+ attempts these past 2 weeks. nearly every print starts well-- first layers look good etc... but after 2 hours or so i'm getting nozzle clogs. i'm printing lulzbot white 3mm pla at 205c with layer of .12mm and have minimized retraction to 1.5mm @ 25mm/s speed with minimum move of 4mm after thinking retraction was relentless and eventually pulling too much heated filament upwards. i've measured the filament at 2.94mm with .35 nozzle at 30mm/s print speeds. something is happening after 90 minutes where extrusion is slowing down and i seem to notice that things are going badly in the infill first-- as though the infill extrusion width is getting thinner. there are no visible obstacles to the filament & the spool seems to be unrolling fine. any suggestions would be welcomed. it's infuriating to have prints looking great for the first 6-10mm and then failing. i am getting the ground notch in the filament when this happens and have to clean the drive bolt each time. images attached.
thanks-","the ""airy"" upper layers look like under extrusion.  try tightening the thumbscrews on the idler.  could be a bit of heat creep causing the filament to stick, which would result in the under extrusion.

also try tilting the little blower by 1-2mm so air hits the lower heatfin. this should help keep the break cooler... and keep the filament from swelling in the break as it turns molten.

lastly pull the pla out and dip the tip of the filament into some olive oil.  folks call this ""seasoning the hotend"".  the premise is the oil should help lubricate the hotend walls and pass the pla better.

dual duct halo taz 4,"we would like to share our version of what a dual duct fan shroud should look like for the taz 4. it will combat heat creap on those 30+ hour prints plus it cools the print from a 360 degree angle. we are still tweaking the design but it has been a valuable upgrade when it comes to both print quality and fighting heat creap, which can be a complete nightmare. i will include some print specs that have worked well for us. we print using slice3r at 75mm/sec, .25 thickness, .95 to 1.0 extruder multipler, usally 190 to 200 deg. at that feed on semi large prints say 6"" square we print the first two layers with the fan off to increase adheashen to the bed, then increase the fan to 100% for the rest of the print. these are just some base guidelines to start from. one more thing if you are printing from pronter face it will send the code to your printer faster with fewer delays if you run it in mini mode (there is and icon in the upper middle of pronter face that says mini mode) we had problems with hesitation while printing tethered to the computer untill we started using mini mode on pronter face. hope this helps

check out the above link for details.  cliff notes version: my factory power supply cooling fan died, so i retrofitted a standard desktop pc cooling fan to do the job.  i like this new configuration better, but be careful if you decide to try it, because power supplies can be dangerous.  i used an oven mitt and some aluminum foil to de-energize any capacitors that might hold a lingering charge prior to touching anything, and of course the first thing i did was unplug it from the wall.

if you print a pc fan adapter now (before your factory fan dies), you won't need to make a cardboard adapter just to print the abs adapter like i did.

i hope this is useful to someone!  my taz has been good to me, despite requiring a lot of tlc.  they are excellent machines.

cheers,

taz 5 dual extruder to reach 300c,"i just bought a taz 5 and am having tons of success.  the new extruder 2.0 (max 300c) gets a lot of the credit.

now i'm looking to upgrade to a dual extruder but the current off-the-shelf lulzbot option maxes out at only 240c.

what are my best options to get a dual extruder to reach 300c with the taz 5?  3rd party vendors and hacks welcome.","i figured it is part of the taz 6.  but who wants to wait months and months?

apparently this is more ""on the edge"" that i realized.

does anybody have an experience rigging up one of these dual extruders on a taz 4 or 5?

recommended computer hardware for the taz5?,"i am seriously considering purchasing a taz5 and a computer to drive it ... is there a list of minimum computer hardware that would be required or recommended to drive printing to a taz5?

thanks,

eric","eric,

no need to pick up an extra computer. you can slice the file and load the gcode directly to the sd card to print tetherless. (all standard on the taz 5). if you don't have an sd reader on the current computer, you can find an usb adapter fairly cheap.

extruder 1 heats slowly - dual extruder,"hello,

i recently installed a dual extruder onto my taz 5 and i installed the required firmware as instructed.

extruder 1 is having a very difficult time heating. in the last 1.5 hours it has heated to only 39 degrees.
extruder 2 heated to 240 within just a couple minutes.

i confirmed the cables are all plugged in correctly and even attempted to re-flash the dual firmware a couple times, however i'm not having any luck.

i searched the forums but haven't found anything similar to this issue, so i'm hoping some of you may have some ideas.","ok, first off, what extruders are you using with this? the taz5 shipped with the hexagon hotend. the taz 4 dual extruder firmware is designed for two buddaschnozzle hotends, which use a different type of heater core and possibly a different thermistor. 

the configuration.h file has several differences between the 4 and the 5 firmware. for example:

taz4

#define temp_sensor_0 7
#define temp_sensor_1 7
#define temp_sensor_2 0
#define temp_sensor_bed 7

taz5

#define temp_sensor_0 5
#define temp_sensor_1 5
#define temp_sensor_2 0
#define temp_sensor_bed 7

// 5 is 100k thermistor - atc semitec 104gt-2 (used in parcan & j-head) (4.7k pullup)
// 7 is 100k honeywell thermistor 135-104lag-j01 (4.7k pullup)
and 

taz4
// if you are using a preconfigured hotend then you can use one of the value sets by uncommenting it
// buda 2.0 on 24v
    #define  default_kp 6
    #define  default_ki .3
    #define  default_kd 125

taz5
// ao-hexagon (24v)
    #define  default_kp 28.79
    #define  default_ki 1.91
    #define  default_kd 108.51

i haven't looked at the firmware enough to even tell if you can specify two different types of hotend inside firmware. 

either way, it may quite vary well be in the firmware itself if you are trying to mix hotends, or you may have damaged the heater core itself during installation, which can happen. or its plugged in wrong."
out of round large herringbone extruder gear,"i have had a clicking with my taz 4 since i got it, and i have updated it to a hexagon hotend which comes with a new extruder and all.

i finally decided to figure out what the clicking was as i have read of other people mentioning the same issue. turns out the large herringbone gear is ever so slightly out of round (mind you these both came from lulzbot). when the machine would retract there was a click sound if the motor was on the smaller side of the gear. i could see the exact problem with the extruder in my hand. on one side of the herringbone the smaller gear was perfect, not tight, not loose, but on the other side of the large gear there was about a 1mm gap in the teeth so when the direction was reversed it would smack into the other side.

when i decided to figure it out i was printing out a vase that had a tone of retraction and that is when i figured out it only did it when the gear was on one side. basically it seems to be about 1/4th of the gear is where the main issue is.

i am now printing a new gear with a little bit higher resolution than the original. i plan on taking a lot of measurements to assure it's accurate and then try it to see if the clicking is gone.",when assembling the extruder it takes about 30 seconds to see if the gear is correct. i might suggest to lulzbot to add this to there qa checklist. the parts i have printed since i replaced the gear also look a bit nicer. i think that small gap of doing nothing (except clicking) may have affected the print when on the side of the failure.
loading profile settings directly from sd card,"new user here...am i missing how to load profile settings (i.e. pla_cura_fast, etc.) directly from the sd card to my taz5?  i see how to load a part file to print on the lcd display, but what if i'm not using my computer and i want to update the profile for a particular run of parts?

the control board that the sd card is plugged into only reads/understands the control code(gcode) that is contained on the sd card to print the part.. the profiles are used by the slicing software on your computer(curaengine/slic3r) to create the printer control code files that you save to the sd card to allow you to print on the printer without your computer having to be attached to print the model with. thus freeing up your computer to be used for other things or taken elsewhere to be used."
likelihood of success??,"in the past i have had professionals make the attached part from a polycarbonate type material.  a very stiff/strong material is required, but not really the heat resistance of polycarbonate.

i'd like to consider making more of these parts myself as it appears that the machine could quickly pay for itself.

but, in reading up on things, it appears that this part is quite large and challenging.  i'm very much interested in the thoughts of the people with experience to know if this is biting off too much for this machine/process.  i'm happy to spend 2-3months learning with much more realistic and small projects, but eventually it is this part that is driving the need to get into 3d printing at all.

it looks like the structure that would need to support this part while being made might be a challange?  how would you orient it if the goal was to have the the ""slot"" as smooth as possible?

thanks for your thoughts!","well... the part fits on the print bed... but you would need to put it on its side.  the resulting upper edge of the track would require supports.  it doesn't look impossible for the taz, but could be a challenge.  polycarbonate filament can be bought.  

here's a preview of the project in simplify3d. 



 preview of part in simplify3d 

it may be possible to eliminate some supports depending on the radius of the track, and resulting overhang angle on upward sloping curve.

i guess my concern would be the strength and durability.  print orientation is key to part strength.  with the part printed on the side, the track may not be as strong laterally due to the way filament layers will be deposited.  with that said, i don't think its impossible to nail the layer adhesion with polycarbonate (i have no experience with the material).

getting a smooth track finish would really depend on the print resolution.  again with the part oriented on its side, the layer height would control the overall resolution of the track.  this is also the biggest constraint on print time.  so for a large project like this, i'd probably go with a .5 nozzle and a layer height of .2 or .3 which will result in a smooth finish... and can be lightly sanded to further produce a better finish.  as a reference, a .2 layer height would be about a 32hr print and .3 would be about 22hrs.

at 75% infill, each part would be about 3.5lbs of filament... which means you would have to pause the print somewhere (preferably in the infill) and switch out filament spools.  and with one or two for testing... you're looking at 5 spools @ $45-ish each.


so i think it would be possible to print the part.  the strength and durability of the part may take a few prints to nail.  it really boils down to the cost."

taz 4 dampers installation,the taz 4 motors are pretty loud and i would to minimize it as much as possible. how difficult would it be to install stepper motor dampers? and would i need to change any settings in the printer ?,"you just bolt them in between the motor and the mounting point. 2 bolts go into the motor, 2 into the frame. you don't need to change any firmware settings, you might need to adjust your pully positioning for the x and y axis and the z axis couplers."
abs part lifting/warping off bed of taz5,"i have been experiencing part lift/warp printing with abs on my new taz5. the part itself is part of the reason: 1/10 thick walls 1"" tall and roughly 8"" by 10.75"". however, the confusing thing is that it only happens on the front corners of the build plate. the rear corners are fine. yes, i did level the bed, so i don't think that is the issue (i guess i could have screwed up that somehow.) i did print using a raft. the part is rather large, so i am running into space issues...

in watching james bruton's youtube videos, he advocates paying the parts flat, and breaking them into sections for printing, to reassemble later. i can do this, but it seems like most of this is working. print times are long, however, 11 hours) so experimentation is a bit tedious. 

the room in which i have the printer is closed, with no drafts, so the temperature is consistent. i do intend to build an enclosure for the printer, but i hope to get this part done first (to finish off a project i am currently working on.) 

i've tried using both cura for taz and mattercontrol (which i prefer overall, though it could use a few improvements), each with the same results. 

any suggestions?

thanks,

jay roth","once again, thanks kcchen_00.  making the adjustments you mentioned in that last comment let me yield my first perfect part result.  very stoked.  you have guru status.  

i will try to summarize for anyone searching the forum for this info:

[1]  wipe acetone/abs solution (google it) on the bed prior to printing
[2]  after calibrating z height with the paper feeler method, lower z end stop additionally by ? to ¼ turn to get closer to bed
[3]  nozzle temp @ 240c, bed temp @ 110c for printing
[4]  when generating g-code, leave fan off during the first 3 to 4 mm, then ramp up gradually to a max of 40% fan power.
[5]  bed temp @ 50c for part extraction
[6]  in my case, it adheres so well, now i'm stymied trying to pry it off...

hope this helps someone.  credit to kcchen_00."
convert flexi-dualie to standard dual head?,"can i change the flexi-dualie head to a standard head (example the one that came allready with the taz5)
so i can hen a standart dual extruder, and when i want change the standart head to the flexi-duali head ?

if is possible, how can i do it?","hi there,

certainly doable. keep in mind the flexydually heads will both have .5mm nozzles, and the standard is .35mm. it is easiest to make them match (get a budaschnozzle with a .5mm nozzle). if you do have the nozzles mismatched and your silcing program (like cura) can't handle it, you can tell it that both nozzles are .35mm nozzle and i personally have had fine results printing with .35mm profiles on a .5mm nozzle. only lie to your taz this way if you have built up an otherwise trusting relationship, though.

also make sure you keep the low profile nema 17 on the extruder, as the torque settings are different for the motors, and the larger stepper will not fit.

have fun!"
brand new taz 5 not extruding properly on day 2,"i got this machine last night and went through the setup documentation meticulously.  everything seemed to work as it should and i even got a few small prints out last night.  i'm using lulzbot pla filament.  this morning it won't extrude consistently and tends to curl up right as it comes out of the nozzle.  could my nozzle be clogged already and if so, what steps should i take to clear it?  i've already used a piece of wire from a wire brush and pushed up in there and did a few cold pulls but it still doesn't want to extrude correctly.  i thought it may have something to do with the hobbed bolt but even when i push the filament manually it still happens.","you can do a forum search for ""nozzle clog"" and similar terms and you'll find some good ideas.

also (i grabbed this from someone else's post) here's lulzbot's instructions for clog clearing: https://www.lulzbot.com/support/unclogging-tips .

one thought (since i don't know your experience level):  the taz5 comes with abs still in it.  when you switch to pla you have to leave the extruder at abs temperature as you feed in the pla until you're sure the last of the abs is out of the head.  then lower the setting to pla temperature.  otherwise some abs may be left in the nozzle, since abs won't melt at pla-melting temperature.

or you could use esun's extruder-cleaning filament in between, it's good at both abs and pla temperatures.

another thought:  is your idler bearing spinning freely when it's swung back and not touching the filament?  if not, that's the first thing to fix."
vertical ripples,"i have been fighting an issue with rippling in my prints. it is at its worst when printing at a 45 degree angle on the bed. that is when the x and y are moving equal distances to make the line. my bearing are tight and my belts are reasonably tight. you can't play a tune on them but they are not loose.

has anyone experienced this? could this be a controller or motor problem? any suggestions are appreciated.

all four sides of the part look like this.




","that one is a hard one to track down. i've seen it before on my ao-10x. it can be caused by a worn or clogged rod bearing skipping on a surface in the direction of travel where the problem was at. it can be caused by an overly loose bed, extruder mount, or bearing set. it can also be at the extruder level rather than at the travel level. a slightly loose small extruder gear setscrew can cause something similar to that. drag caused by overextrusion and a loose extruder head can cause a ripple like that as well, particularily after a change in layer pattern (like after a bolt hole) 

i'd reccommend checking everythng for slop and tightness, then going from there"
taz 5 power supply issue,"just got a brand new taz 5 a few days ago and it looks like i got hit with the power supply problem.   

was in the middle of my fourth print and all power went out. green light also went out on the power supply. unit is dead. i just emailed support but was wondering if anyone knew a better way to get ahold of them. i am using this machine to produce a custom bracket for my company and now i am shut down. it seems like this is a pretty big problem with these machines. is anything being done to address it other then just to replace? lastly, will lolzbot do any form of rush shipping? when i ordered the printer it took 7 days to arrive to my local fedex office. i really cant wait that long. i need the option to pay for overnight or second day air. something!     thanks guys! i was really happy with the printer up until the moment it died.","special-k wrote:rt1 is a ntc thermistor, being used as a inrush current limiter.
with a new power supply in hand, thanks to the awesome support staff at aleph, i compared it against the dead one.

rt1 looks to be 5d-15 ntc thermistor, a $2.50 part you can get from mouser. although both supplies are nearly identical, there are some subtle differences in component layout.

i believe my old supply was also subjected to a drop at some point prior to delivery, as it had some damage indicators in form of broken plastic screw posts. further, one of the legs on l1 choke broke at the board, and the inductor itself was at an odd angle with its adhesive bond to the pcb having been broken. i have no idea how this would've affected ac filtering, and there are four other legs from the same choke that are fine.

my taz is humming away on the new supply, and all-in-all, i think i can repair the old one. if nothing else, i'd have an emergency backup on hand if the new supply ever decides to fail once it's out of warranty. 
arrover wrote:i think i may have a power supply issue too. my taz 5 is about a month old so i'm just learning right now. i was printing yesterday and everything was going smoothly until the machine totally reset itself...
sounds similar to how mine went. about 80% through a 10 hour job, the printer seemed to reset, as i found it sitting idle with lcd screen not responding. power cycled it and restarted the job, and the supply went out during the bed pre-heat.

if your printer is only a month old, you should really drop an email to support@lulzbot.com, or give them a call during business hours at the number on their support page. they will get you taken care of, and from the sound of things, you are not alone with this problem."
item deformation,"i have been printing with my taz 3 i recently acquired.

have had some issues and most of them i have found answers through here , reading blogs or through my supplier.

but, i was trying to print a small herringbone gear for the extruder, but when it prints its always deformed and higher on one side of the print whereas the rest of the print is very nice.

i have leveled the bed to .254 using a feeler gauge all around, it pretty much measures .254mm anywhere in the bed between the nozzle and the bed, i test 16 different points on the bed and all are the same height.

yet i print this herringbone gear and it gets higher always on the same side towards 00 on the bed.

i have tried to make the bed higher and lower on either end and i still get the same result.

any suggestions?","i resorted to level the extruder bars but measuring from the stepper motor to the bar, gave me a much more accurate reading than from the aluminum plate on the bed.

then i re leveled the bed.
i also leveled the extruder nozzle by making sure the distance around the heater block was the same all around the bed at all point in the bed. i moved the nozzle to 16 different points in the bed and measured form the bed to the nozzle using a feeler gauge. i measured from the bed to the heater block and made sure the measurements are the same all around. 

i have been getting much better prints since i re leveled everything using this way of measuring.

i had some more pressing parts to print so i have not tried the herringbone again.

i suspect it is a heat issue and instead of printing one gear i will make a print of 9 of them to allow cooling time between layers.

i printed several items on the bed at different locations and all measurements came out perfect.

so i am hoping it boils down to heat.


thanks!"
noises coming from extruder assembly,"as my prints are going through, i head an occasional ""click"".
it is happening as the extruder is pushing material and not when it reverses to move.

anyone have any ideas?","i had a sound like that, it turned out to be the reel of filament ""climbing up"" on the shoulder of the reel holder as it slowly turned, then dropping back down.  it really mystified me until i just happened to be looking at it when it happened.  that might not be it, but it's something to watch for."
taz 4 idler bearing not rotating freely,"greetings,

finally made the jump to the lulzbot family after having my afinia h479 printer for 2 years as beginner printer. 

i just recently bought a taz 4 from i-t works and spent 2 days just overall inspecting the entire unit. everything looks solid and i took the time to verify that all the screws were tight and belt tension was good. the issue i ran into is when i first did an extrusion test, the filament would extrude then stop then extrude and stop. this repeats multiple times. the feed gear is full of grinded up filament and i noticed that the idler bearing is not rotating freely, it takes some effort to actually rotate it. i adjusted the tension slowly to see if the bearing will rotate and it did not. it seems to be causing a friction to the filament as the feed gear is rotating causing some extrusion issue. it looks like the bearing is on that plastic piece very well and i am unable to move it. anyone have any suggestions on how to resolve this issue? 

i removed the tensioner and applied a little bit of downward force into the extruder as it was going its print calibration and it printed perfectly. now i just need to resolve this little hiccup.","i've had a similar problem with my taz5.  i don't know if this will apply to the taz4 idler bearing, but i hope it will.

the cause in my case was lots of small plastic fragments (i think debris from the support structures used to make the arm that holds the idler bearing) lodged in the narrow gaps around the side of the bearing and also in the curved path that the face of the bearing rotates through.  they put a heavy drag on the bearing.

the fix, for me anyhow:
-- remove the tension on the bearing arm.
-- unscrew the long screw holding the bearing arm in place and remove the bearing arm.
-- clear the particles in the gaps on the sides and along the face of the bearing.  thin metal sheets cut into small strips will help.
-- for clearing any particles along the curved surface that the bearing rotates close to, the only way i found to reach into there was to partly remove the bearing from its holder.  on the taz5 the bearing axle is a tight friction fit in the printed part.  to get it started coming out i pressed the bearing holder arm against a flat piece of wood, which got it started out.  then you may have room to clear any particles there.  or you can continue and remove the bearing entirely.
-- when done, press the bearing back into the arm, and reassemble everything.

i only had to do that once, and in the month since then the problem hasn't come back.  still, whenever i have the idler bearing out of the way to do a filament change, i always check to see that it's still spinning freely.

let us know if that helps!"
changing to a chimera,"hello all,

i had a friend once. then he ruined the printhead on my printer by ""accidentally"" slicing through almost all of the wires on the printhead setup.

now, i am looking at buying a new toolhead setup and was wanting a bit of input from you guys. i could go ahead and buy a new taz v2 printhead, but i am kinda thinking about going through e3d and purchasing a chimera since it is a good bit cheaper, and would offer me the option for dual extrusion.

what i'm wondering is:

1. can i expect the same quality as the hexagon hotend?
2. can i get the same high temps out of these printheads as i can with the hexagon hotend?
3. what would i have to do to be able to mount, connect, and use the chimera to the taz 5?

thanks in advance for any help!

jake","well, a chimera is a dual head extruder. that means you need to rig your printer for dual extrusion. that means 2 extruder motors, 2 motor control wires, 2 fans, 2 thermistors, 2 hobbed boltes and extruder transmission gears, etc. the stock wade extruder doesn't really line up well with that particular extruder model, so you're going to have to go with a different style of extruder, or a hybrid bowden / stock design. 

quality should be comparable if you engineer it correctly and get it dialed in well. e3d makes good hotends generally
temperatures should be about the same. it's basically 2 e3dv6's sharing a main body. 

you would have to do alot of different highly technical printer modifications and designs to fit that to a taz 5. that would include running additional wires and connectors, changing firmware, engineering a new mount, extruder body and motor layout, and making sure it all works well, is stable, is balanced and is adjustable. then you have to figure out the dual extruder printing offsets, etc. 

its definitly something that could be done. i've modified a bunch of crazy things to printers so far, and i would rate that as a very complicated project for what its worth."
replacement stepper motor for taz5,"hi all,

enclosure,"hey everyone!

i just recently decided to build a enclosure for the taz for several reasons, but i'm having an issue with the filament getting chewed by the extruder. the question arises will the excessive heat contribute to the possibly of the filament becoming more malleable for the bolt to ""chew"" into it, the filament in question is abs. if this is due to the heat would a simple grid exhaust area fix this issue or would a small exhaust fan be more worthwhile. thanks, prime!

i can not think of anything else and was hopeing someone might have some further suggestions or could direct me to further information on the topic.  i am being driven to drink by this damn thing, and i cant afford to be an alcoholic!

hey! sorry for the late reply, but was/am printing in abs/pla. prior to these clogging issues i was printing in a filament trial test that included woodfill. the woodfill left a residue that would be akin to sap and would clog the nozzle. another note that i think you should check is the filament and its overall quality. checking the quality of the filament would be  easily done via cutting several sections from the spool with a pair of pliers/cutters. once a few sections of around 8-10 inches each have been cut away from one another bend the sections in half until the filament snaps without binding/smashing the filament(the may be repeated until the sections snaps off naturally). this should achieve a ""clean"" unaltered breakage of the inside of the filament allow you to see any errors or voids. a poor grade of filament may have these voids causing air pockets and clogs to appear. continue snapping the filament sections into about a total of 4-8 pieces per sections to check for any errors or voids. the following photo shows illustrations of the voids that can appear and will range in size. a better grade filament or trusted supplier would be your best bet in getting no voided filament. this is the only other thing that i can find that is causing my clogging issues. if you need anymore info let me know!

i have personally experience several clogs again due to the cheap filament possessing voids that can be seen in the ""bubbled"" end of the filament where the clog occurs.

taz v nozzle clogging,"i just got my taz 5 recently and only ran a few prints before it stopped working.

if i tell the taz to extrude, nothing comes out as if the nozzle is clogged and the filament feeding mechanism just digs its teeth into the filament. i can force plastic through manually and it will come out the end of the nozzle slowly, but it takes much more force than it should. i tried three cold pulls with no results. i'm using some 3 mm abs, i also tested another strand of 3 mm filament i had laying around. what other steps should i try to get my taz printing again?","@garthbartin

you can try the cold pulls with pla, it is allegedly more ""rubbery"", though i never had any luck with this.

the first step after ""cold pulls"" is probably to remove and clear the nozzle.
    1 - bring the hotend up to temperature and loosen the nozzle, then remove it when it cools.
    2 - remove the filament and clean the hobed bolt with the small wire brush/ dental pick/ ""compresed air"".  if you dont the teeth of the bolt will be ""blunt"" due to the chewed away filament stuck in them.  i always give it a good blow out with a high pressure compressed air generator.
    3 - you can then bring it back up to temperature (because it wont extrude otherwise) and run some filament through without the nozzle. to clear out the hot end.
    4 - while this is going on, soak the nozzle in acetone (you said you were using abs? or d-limonene {or apparently (r)-(+)-limonene} for hips or ?methyl-ethelene-spam {mek} / caustic soda for pla {not sure yet}).  give the jar a good shake twice a day or so, and attempt to clean it out with something that isn't going to scratch the bore (eg a good quality cloth on a wooden scewer).  you could use the blunt end of a 3mm drill bit by hand.
    5 - once the large bore is clear the only way i have found to reliably clear the nozzle tip is the blunt end of the appropriate sized drill bit (0.5mm, 0.35mm etc).
    6 - stick the nozzle back on.

  there are multiple other suggested ways.  heating the nozzle with blow torch/ heat gun/ solder iron/ oven etc but i have found the acetone and patience clears abs the best.

    you then need to figure out why....  (which i am still working on!)  ... comes down to:
        to much back pressure at nozzle or in bore
                or trying to push it through to fast (print speed)
        to soft filament to early (heat creep)
        crappy filament
        to much drag, spool binding
        buildup of ""discoordination""(???) - ie missing steps due to failure to calibrate e-steps correctly gradually clogging teeth
        ????dust on filament (not sure about this one, but i'm reaching for straws myself)"
taz damaged out the box - help me fix it,"first thing, i am looking for assistance to resolve the issues i have listed below.

upon un-boxing my taz 5 today i found that the z-x axis assembly rocked when placed on a flat surface. closer inspection showed rear, lower left perspex frame bracket was broken


oh well this is not ideal but i can make a plan for now and just print a replacement. i removed one of the top brackets for a template (the frame for the top of the z axis prevents the rest of the frame moving with this removed).
someone have a link for me to a printable version or a cad drawing i can use to machine one?
hacked together a temporary part out of 2mm abs.


frame still rocked. i tried loosening a few of the corner brackets, checking the two aluminium extrusions were flush. no luck. the front right foot on the z-x axis was still 1-2mm off the table.
should i strip the unit down to bare frame and use an engineering square to correct or is there a better way?


getting frustrated i decided to continue with adding the y axis. this prevented most of the rocking but the foot still sits above the table surface. 

i then go through the set up and find that the one side of the x axis was ~1mm higher than the other (hoping for an easy fix here to the wobble) but once even, the foot is still in the air

screw it i want to print something. i follow the leveling procedure then plan to print the bed leveling file on the sd card

i get things up to temperature for abs and manually extrude some plastic with the head 20mm off the bed to see all is good. cool, home everything and start the print from the controller on the taz.
after ~1 perimeter of the print surface i realise that stubby bit of abs that shipped probably wont be enough and stop the printer by turning it off.

turn things back on, set temps for abs, retract the filament that shipped and push the short supplied section in until i get some oozing out. lock the idler into place and set extrusion to 150mm as per the quick start guide. click extrude and watch as very quickly the white filament turn to green followed by the hot end coming free of the rest of the extruder   


at this point it was 3 hours after i started so i cleaned off the filament and came home from work to post this :/ 

can i just push the hot end back in and what did i do wrong to force it out?

____________________________________________________________________________

so basically any help for the above questions would be great. ill see what i can work out with the hot end in the morning.
thanks in advance

ps: one of the supplied plugs was also damaged but luckily not one i needed to use https://i.imgur.com/m0nwhcg.jpg","so i am much less happy than i was after my last post

after delayed communications over the course of a week lulzbot provided shipping documents to return the printer via fedex and this was collected from me on 29 may

fedex contacted me the same day saying that insufficient details were provided on the shipping documents to process the shipment and lulzbot was contacted to provide the missing information.
lulzbot shipping manager has been involved since 1 june and i have yet to get the required documents

no replacement printer will be shipped to me until fedex ships the old one. fedex refuses to ship the old one until they get the correct paperwork. i am caught in the middle and getting frustrated.

after initial encouraging sizes this would be handled well i think the company has dropped the ball"
alignment problems,"i noticed that after some prints the right rod (watching from the front of the printer) is not at the same level of the orher. i think it could be the problem of one of the stepped motors, how can i verify that?",you should turn off the printer and turn the one screw until they are level. measure with a ruler. adjust the bed to match nozzle.
"why does this happen? thoughts, i'm out of them.","any idea why, at exactly the same number or rows up in everything i print, this happens?

it's fine before these layers, and fine after them ... i just can't figure it out.

thanks for any help you can give (sorry i had to attach the file, stuck using iphone at the moment).




","first off, is that part supposed to have a slant to it? if not, tighten the belt and the motor pulley in whichever direction that is. 

as for the layer change issue, there are a couple of things going on. for starters, you have some lifting. i'd try bumping the bed temperature up about 6-8 degrees above where you have it the lifting is causing the first layers to get closer to the nozzle, which cause it to extrude less than it thinks it is, which causes backpressure. that will generally slowly decrease as the model goes up, but if you have enough excess pressure in the nozzle chamber, when you transition from a larger surface area to shed excess, to a smaller one, it can cause surface roughness and overextrusion until the printer can normalize. 

you are probably overextruding a bit. check your actual fillament diameter with calipers in 3 places, take the average, and then use that number as the filament width setting inside of your slic3r program. it's usually 3.00 by default, which can be good or bad depending on which fillament you are using. they vary in width dramatically sometimes. 

if that doesn't take care of it, you may need to adjust the esteps of your extruder slightly. to do that, look up ""3d printer calibration"" and follow the guidelines. generally you end up measuring 110 mm of filament up from the top of the extruder body, then extrude 100mm, and measure how far your mark is from the point you measured from the first time. it should be exactly 10mm. if it is more or less, you do some math, then adjust the value in the firmware, etc. there are a couple of guides with links for how to do that in the forum here. generally the lulzbot printers are pretty well dialed in from the factory, so you probably won't have to do that part. 

other things to check for, make sure your extruder is solidly mounted to the x carriage. there should be very little play there up or down. if there is, you may have to move the rail bearings on the back in or out to ensure they are in full contact with the rails themselves. 

you might also want to check your starting layer height. if you are too close, you can get an excess of plastic from the first layer out. since you are getting lifting on that small of a part, i'm guessing thats not the case here, but it could be. post a picture of that same print but stopped after the first layer and we'll be able to tell for sure."
really frustrated.,"so i'm on my 3rd hotend v2.  and this one has the same problem.  made a beautiful print.  made anotehr print.  went to extrude plastic for a third print, and the thing is clogged again.  i've been doing cold pulls for hours.  the gears are chewing up the filament.  if this problem persists, i'm sending this thing back.     last time i resorted to trying to get the nozzle off, and it stripped inside.  i'm going to continue to do cold pulls and hope this works.  if not, forget the taz5.  there's something wrong with the tool end, and i'm geting fed up with having to send it back.  suggestions please.","a couple of things to check:

make sure, when the idler bearing that pushes the filament against the hobbed bolt is swung completely away from the filament, that it spins freely.  when my taz arrived it didn't, i found small shreds of support material from when the bearing carrier was made in the very small gaps around the idler bearing.  cleaning that out so that bearing spins completely freely is critical.

also, it's my practice to wait a few minutes after the extruder is up to full temperature before beginning a print, to allow the heat to spread through the entire nozzle area before starting.  i also always do a couple of 10 mm extrude operations into the air, with the extruder 50 mm or more above the bed, before starting a print to ensure everything's running smoothly."
upgraded to taz 5 now print issues,"so posting here hoping i can get some ideas on how to solve my issue. originally a taz 4 - hot end died so i picked up the new one. flashed the firmware, little fan humming away, everything heats up...but i can’t get it to stop doing this: 

http://i.imgur.com/b3jgcsy.jpg

so first please forgive the bubbles in the pet tape; it's not normally like that, a bit frustrated (been dealing with this for the last few weeks) and i didn't feel like messing with it atm. but the result is the same pet tape or no pet tape. printing in both abs and pla. all the same mess. it's like the extruder is pushing material too slowly during infill. i took my filament over to a friend’s house to try on his taz 5 and it worked just fine.

additionally, when i raise the extruder and just extrude x amount of filament it comes out without issue. and it seems to print the borders of the print just fine, but is having the problem on the infill. 

customer service, who are normally great, haven't been much help in this. so i'm hoping i can get some ideas here.","what happens when you try to push the filament through the nozzle with the idler unlatched and by hand, does it bind as you push it in?

if it's binding or it's not flowing, those are the first thing to address. align your mount plate and extruder and clear a clog if need be.

if it's flowing, then test the extruder by running this to extrude filament for 3 minutes.
code: select allg92 e0
g1 e300 f100
g92 e0

another possibility is swell in the heatsink so look at the end of the filament when you pull it out to see if it looks like it might be binding against the walls of the extruder."
how long should the pei sheet last?,"well, i too am experiencing the bubbling of my pei sheet on the taz 5. the printer is about 3 months old and i have a few hundred hours of printing on it. i have only used hips and have always had a problem with the hips warping on longer prints. i started using a 20 line brim to counteract this and at first it was helping some. now even my brims are starting to peel up in spots and then the whole part starts to lift and curl. it seems if as my sheet has lost it's stickiness. i just got a mini in the mail yesterday and i have so far only printed in pla on that. but the parts are sticking to the build plate like glue. i had to use the clam knife to pry them off. i remember when i first got my taz and it was the same way. is there any way to make it sticky again without adding gluestick or lulz juice? i think i saw someone say something once about using sandpaper to rough it up a bit. if this works, what grit should i try? something rough or something fine? as always thanks in advance for any help. i've been at it 3 months but i'm still a noob.","oyher than bubbling, the pei sheets should last a while.  depends on how much damage afflicted when removing prints.  it doesn't lose ""stickiness"".  

to clean isopropyl alcohol is fine every so often.  ipa does dry out pei eventually.  fine grit sandpaper (i've been using a mr. clean magic eraser) helps to remove some of the dust and oil.  i suppose diluted dishwashing liquid could also remove oils.

ultimately, lowering the nozzle is key to adhesion.  the end stop knob can be finicky, so adjust by eighth or sixteenth turns.  i find the z-offset in slicing software gives you even further granularity than the end stop knob.  negative value for z-offset gets nozzle closer for better adhesion, positive off-swt value moves the nozzle higher for less adhesion.  i try to stay aware of how the print comes off the pei at 50c, and adjust by .05 or .10 for the next print (if done in succession).


fwiw, my pei is starting to bubble also.  i think its the humidity... if i replace the pei, i'm going to figure out how to seal the edges better... clamp the edges or seal with silicone.  for the time being, i'm starting to play with raft settings until i can figure out what the next steps are."
question on buying a taz 5 with a dual extruder,"i'm interested in getting a taz 5 with a dual extruder instead of the single extruder.  it doesn't look like that is an option and you get a single extruder whether you want it or not.  to add a dual extruder do you throw away the single extruder that came with the unit, and replace replace it with the dual extruder.  that would be a waste.  or does the dual extruder actually come with one hotend and you cannibalize the hotend from the single extruder to add to the dual extruder add-on?

i would think that the dual extruder would be an option in place of the single extruder when ordering.

steve","the taz 5 ships with the single extruder toolhead.  there is a common x-carriage that is fixed to the x-rods, the toolheads are interchangeable. the dual extruder toolhead can be swapped out... sort of like a camera lens on a camera body.

with that said, the current taz comes with a single all-metal hotend (called the hexagon).  the current editions of the dual extruder on lb's site use the ceramic hotends (called the budaschnozzle).  the toolheads (flexi and dually) are compatible, but require a firmware downgrade.

not to confuse you even more... there is a dual hexagon toolhead in the works.  you can follow the development:
https://devel.lulzbot.com/taz/accessories/
the project name descriptions are at the bottom of the page, look for ""javelin"".  good pictures of the the dual head in the photos directory.  

you can cannibalize the single to make the dual if you want to acquire the 2nd set of hardware & cables, print and machine the rest of the extruder.  it makes sense to me to have an intact single and a complete dual toolhead."
"taz 5 hotend problem, please help","i am having another problem with my taz 5. i have had it for two weeks as of yesterday. i printed out a large herring bone gear and that print went well. yesterday when i got  i home from work, i figured that i would print out the small one and see how that went. well the printer started acting like the extruder was clogged and nothing would come out. i removed the nozzle and soaked it in acetone overnight. this morning i cleaned the nozzle out and reassembled the extruder, but  now i am having a different problem. every time i try to print or just to extrude filament, the filament just curls up on itself and the printer wont print anything. if there is anyone who can walk me through fixing this or has an idea what would cause it, i would really appreciate your help. i really just want to get back to printing. thanks in advance. below is a video of the problem that i am having. ","i had this problem as well after upgrading my taz4 to the taz 5's all metal hot end.  i had tried the solutions listed here without luck, but did eventually stumble upon a solution that worked for me and i've been printing almost non-stop for the past 3 weeks without a problem.

the ""wobble"", for lack of a better term, occurred right from the beginning on my first print, but since i also had (without realizing it) fried the smaller fan, all my prints would also jam / clog after 15 minutes so i started to think it was related.  but after realizing the fan was dead, cleaning out the clogs, and replacing the fan - i could consistently print but the wobble was still there.

in fact, the prints were coming out perfectly without any failures (as compared to original taz4 hot ends), except for the wobble.  it seemed to happen more on the lower layers and i tried varying speeds, which made a difference, but not how i expected.  slow speeds seemed to have more wobble than faster speeds, but the was a lot of variation from material to material.  and  since i could get higher temps, i had been printing in madesolid pet+ and t-glase (both of which need slow print speeds), but this meant i was really seeing the effect.  although it actually looked pretty cool in the t-glase.

anyway, i tried all the steps suggested here, but since i was nearly at the end of the 14 return period, i decided it must be a defect in the nozzle that i couldn't repair and i was ready to send it back.

as i was waiting for lulzbot support to get back to me i randomly came across: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:755184 which talks about a harmonic ripples in the taz 5 hot end and provides a strengthened extruder body. 

i attached my old hot end, flashed firmware back to taz4, and printed it out in abs and installed it (without doing the other upgrades to the carriage the author mentions) and since then problem has been resolved.

if you go this route, which i would definitely recommend doing so since my taz 4 is now more consistent than ever,  make sure you have a long enough screw (60mm long) to mount the tool to the carriage. and perhaps have and extra idler printed first, seeing as its not easy to remove the idler.  if you're like me and it's your first time fully disassembling and re-assembling the entire tool, then you may find, as i did, that out of frustration you accidentally destroy the extruder idler.  the reason is, all the other components have either screws which can be easily removed or bolts whose nut can be accessed for easy removal.  but the idler has a hidden nut that can't be reached while loosening or tightening the bolt.  the but is sunk into a correctly sized hole directly behind the head of the bolt / screw.  the abs should hold it in place, but can easily strip. 

if, as has happened to me, the nut slips and strips the abs around it, it becomes very tricky to remove.  after destroying one out of frustration, and then seeing what the problem was i was able to drill a tiny hole for a m2 screw perpendicular to the idler mounting screw, behind the screws head just before the idler body meets the extruder body - so the drill bit hits the nut.  then screw in a small m2 machine screw.  if done correctly, it will provide the tension on the nut so it can't spin freely and the idler screw can be replaced.

in case you need to reprint the extruder idler: http://devel.lulzbot.com/taz/juniper/pr ... der_idler/

i hope this helps anyone still having issues!"
taz 5 resolution,"i am looking at the taz-5 mostly in comparison to the makergear m2. the taz5 lists an xy precision of .05mm where as the m2 lists .01. is it correct that the taz5 is better for large prints with less resolution? (there were comments to that effect on some of the reviews but it may have been the taz4). sometimes specs don't tell the whole story!
thanks!","the m2 uses fully supported linear rail bearings on the x and y axis. the taz uses bearing rod that is fixed at either end, but not supported in the middle. on the other hand the m2 only uses one linear rail for the y bed support, which is offset to one side where the taz has 2 rods. you are probably going to get some additional flex in the middle  of the bed with the taz, where the m2 is probably going to have some issues with excess play on the edge furthest from the linear rail. the z axis on the taz is probably slightly more stable due to the second bearing rod. 

the taz 4 is basically the same as the taz 5, just with a different hotend. 

both printers are very nice units, and they both have some plusses and minuses. i'm a big fan of fully supported bearing rails, and i'm working on a project to add that capacity to the x and later the y axis of the taz. i'm not as much a fan of the way the m2 implements their rails. i get why they did it the way they did to keep costs competitive with other printers, but there were some design tradeoffs to go that route as well. 

unless you are printing with very thin layer heights, it probably doesn't matter either way because the variance in filament based printing extruders is going to be greater than the potential xy precision difference anyways."
abs sizes and clogging the taz,"i have two different abs filament sizes, one measures 2.95mm with my caliper and the other is 2.85mm. the 2.95mm clogs my taz after an hour or so, but it runs fine on my mini. the 2.85mm runs fine on both.

are there settings i can tweak in cura that might help me to run the 2.95mm in my taz without clogging it up?","reprapgirl wrote:does increasing the filament size and decreasing the flow percentage have the same effect?

they both will reduce the feed rate for the filament into the melt chamber, and thus allow the melted plastic the needed time to be forced out of the end of the nozzle. which will help prevent the slow build of pressure in the chamber and eventual clogging. in your case if looks like you would need a 3.44% smaller flow percentage to compensate for the bigger diameter material.  

but i would just change the measured diameter size rather than figure out how much you need to alter the flow rate by."
taz5 clogging.  leads to more issues.,"alright, so after about a 2 week wait i got my extruder tool head back from aleph.  i made a few successful prints, and let another print go while i was going to sleep.  i woke up and it said it was complete, but it was only about half way finished.  after hours upon hours of trying to get the clog out with cold pulls, small wrenches, and any other way i could think of, i found a thread in which the user had heated up the hot end, and then used an 18mm wrench to hold the hot end, and a 8mm wrench to get the nozzle off.   i attempted to do this, and what do you know, the nozzle stripped.  there's very little threading left on the nozzle.

now i was wondering, i have a 3mm nozzle and a 1.75mm nozzle from reprapdiscount.   will the 3 mm nozzle fit the lulzbot hexagon hotend?  if so, does anyone have any tips on how to get the rest of the nozzle out of the hot end?  i'm fairly technically inclined, i'm a mechanic for a living, and have been programming/making/hacking since the age of 11.

so please, any tips on how to fix this.  i ordered extra nozzles from makerspace too in case they will fit this hot end.  when my taz works its a beautiful thing.   i have an art show that i was going to bring it to and show off, but that is in early june.  please help ","unless you are printing with really crappy fillament, it is very rare for the nozzle to actually physically clog. if it ever does, the best way to unclog it is to just pull the fillament out of it from the top side when it is warm enough to move, but not hot enough to flow. that usually gets any foreign objects. 

the fillament probably stopped extruding due to nozzle backpressure. that usually happens because a. the part you are printing partially lifted and pressed up against the nozzle end for too long and caused an effective blockage, b. you might have the fillament diameter set wrong in slic3r and it was overextruding, or c. the idler arm tension screws might not be tight enough, or might be too tight. 

the nozzles you have ""should"" fit in theory. the ao variant hotend has a longer heater block, but the nozzle threading itself is likely the same. 

as far as getting the remaining threads out, thats not going to be an easy process. the reason the nozzle stripped is that plastic leakage tends to act like glue. if you don't heat the nozzle up prior to attempting to remove it, the glue doesn't melt. you can try removing it with acetone if this is abs, but even then you are going to need something like a small dental pick to get the threads out, or possibly something like a tap. might be worth your time to just buy one of these and swap it in. http://www.amazon.com/reprapdiscount-he ... +hotend+ao"

auxilliary power rambo and octopi,"hi all,

i have a taz5 and am running it through octopi (raspberry pi2).  the only options i have seen for powering the raspberry pi directly from the rambo board involve connecting it to the ""aux power out mosfet"".

there appears to be something already connected here in the taz5.  it seems to related to the second power harness but cant identify exactly what.  the 5v blower fan is the only thing i can think of, but neither of my second power harnesses have a connector for the 5v blower fan.  other points i have identified that might be able to provide 5v power are ""pwmext"" (already used by ?extruder0 5v blower), ""motor ext"", ""5v*"" (cant figure out where this actually is), ""spi"" and ""i2c"" though when i tried ""motor ext"" the fan wouldn't run despite measuring 5v accross gnd and vcc.

can anyone tell me what is connected to ""aux power out mosfet""?
does anyone power octopi from the rambo board on a taz5 and if so from where/ how?

locations in double quotes refer to http://reprap.org/wiki/file:rambo-conn-all.jpg

cheers","something needing 5v(probably the small blower fans power connections for the all metal hot ends - if you have them), is what is hooked up to the ""aux power out mosfet"" pins. the other pins on the opposite corner ""aux power out motor"" are the 24v pins for the extrusion fans.

taz 4 upgrade,"hi all,

i apologize for asking what is probably a basic question. what are the steps and parts for upgrading to taz 4?

in particular i am looking for info along the lines of, ""too many things have changed, you can't upgrade earlier models to it"" - or, here are the things that have changed (or are the same). and by this i mean, here are links to the aleph parts store for things you don't have, here are links to the particular printed parts that have changed. 

i have been searching this forum (although ""upgrade"" can't be used as a search, so this is tough), using various terms in google, and examining the aleph website and source files, but haven't found the info yet. i happen to have a taz 1, though any specific info on upgrades to v4 would be useful. what i have found so far about changes between taz versions seems to be:

taz 2.*: lcd (easy upgrade with parts on sale, instructions here: http://ohai-kit.alephobjects.com/projec ... e24ded7fb/)
taz 3.*: 24v/bed (doable upgrade with parts on sale, instructions here: http://ohai-kit.alephobjects.com/projec ... 2v_to_24v/)
taz 4.*: y-axis mounts? drive rod system? power supply?

...is this right so far?","taz 4 changes are: 
1. new leadscrew based z axis (new printed lower z asembly, new printed or laser cut upper z leadscrew bearing assembly, replacement z nut holder). you would also need to source the rod and the upper bearing. i'm asusming the couplers also changed in there but i haven't seen that area yet. 
2. electronics enclosure is cosmetically different to imprve functionality and assembly. the new one looks better, is easier to add and remove cables, etc. but operates the same as a taz 3.1 enclosure. 
3. there are minor changes to the y azis idler end smooth rod mounts, but they mainly deal with making it easier to print and use less pieces. 
4. the power supply for the taz 4 is a new fully encapsulated design. still 24v, still operates about the exact same way, just comes factory sealed to reduce the risk of electric shock. 

the z axis changes are the most signficant changes overall that someone looking to upgrade would be interested in."

i know i have a few questions but this will be my first 3d printer and there seems to be so many choices","hi lilyput. you'll want the more traveled taz section of this forum to get a better answer for this. i can't answer the uk portion of your question, though i do know that lulzbot has printers and supplies warehoused in the uk, so shipping times should be reasonable. 

as far as how the printer compares, it's a large bed printer with all up leadscrews on the z axis, which means it is very accurate. the electronics are 24 volt, so it heats quickly. the mechanicals are well done, all open source and easy to upgrade / replicate. the hot end can't print some of the hotter materials like nylon, but you can swap that out for something different, or wait for the upcoming taz 4.2 (that's a guess on the model number) which may ship with a hexagon all metal hot end. the taz mini will also be shipping soon, which is a smaller print envelope and less expensive depending on what size of printer you need"
sad octopuses,"though admittedly a bit overwhelmed at first, i managed to get my new taz 5 set up, calibrated, and leveled to the best of my ability and was ready to join the exciting world of 3d printing.  



 calibration 


first i followed the included instructions and used pronterface and the sample piece of green abs to create a very sad looking octopus (240/85). 



 george 


after moving tazzy to a table with a sturdier base and repeating the leveling process, i tried again, this time with a spool of white pla (205/60).  unfortunately, george the ugly green octopus now has an equally ugly shiny, white friend.



 george's friend 


at this point, i'm not quite sure what to do.  i've read through several posts that lead me to think it may have something to do with heat or fans, but i'm not trying to do anything fancy... just print the first sample straight from the setup instructions.

i also tried one other print just to see what would happen and i'm attaching photos of that one as well in case it helps diagnose the issue.











i really appreciate any guidance anyone can offer.

thanks!","well, the green octopus in abs i can answer a couple possible questions. it looks like you were too close to the bed for the starting layer. when you are too close you end up with that lumpy looking forst couple of layers that eventually evens out. it also looks like you are slightly overextreuding. usually that means that your fillament diameter settings in your slic3r or cura profile is off slightly. fillament varies in width quite a bit depending on manufacturers and quality. it's not unusual to have a roll anywhere from 2.65mm to 3.12 mm in diameter, and it makes a huge amount of difference to the final quality of the print that you have it set right. take your calipers, measure 3 spots on your fillament and take the average, then use that as your starting fillament diameter and see how it goes. 

pla, it looks like you have some temperature control issues there, but i don't print with it often so i'll let someone else cover that. one thing to be aware of is that when switching from a higher temperature plastic abs) to a lower temperature one (pla) if there is any leftover abs at all in the melt chamber, you might get jams or blockages unless you bump the temperature up to 230 and do a bit of a purge then let it back down to pla printing temperatures."

source for z axis threaded rods,"i seem to have put a slight bend in one of my z axis threaded rods for a taz 4, i've looked through the bom and found that it came from misumi usa, with part number mtsbrk12-420-f7-r8-t9-q8-s20-e5-fe0-fw7-fy1,  but they won't be able to ship 2 of them until the end of july.  they were on this sites store for a bit but were out of stock and i couldn't find them when i went and looked again.   anyone have an idea on where to find them, that can ship in a reasonable time?","piercet wrote:that particular leadscrew set appears to be fairly rare outside of mitsumi. there are alternate rods that would work if you feel adventureous and want to try and math out the z steps. otherwise mitsumi or lulzbot are your best bets.
that sounds about like my luck.   as was suggested i reached out to support for some suggestions on the stock rods,  but i might have to look into changing to different rods.   i'm not too sure what would all be involved in figuring out the z steps though."
how to change xy home position?,i need to change the xy home position for the hot end.  i need to move it back in the y-direction about 13mm which means i will need to move the bed 13mm forward from its stock default home position when homing.  any idea on how to do this?,"in case anyone is wondering, the following gcode will home the hot end to x=0, then y=+12, then z=0:

g90 ;absolute positioning
g1 f1500 ; axes movement rate = 25mm/sec
g28 x ;home x
g28 y ;home y
g1 y12 ;move y+12 so hot end doesn't hit the bed clips when z homes
g1 f150 ;slow movement rate down to 2.5mm/sec for z axis
g28 z ;home z

bed leveling using a digital indicator,"ok, i have seen a few confusing things asked about leveling the bed using a digital indicator.  i will try to clear up a few things for you.

first there are two attachment points you can use.  one is the rail.

this one attaches to the x rails.  nice concept but has a flaw.  you have to remove it to put it on the other side of the print head.  could possibly introduce error.  plus its putzy.

the second attachment is in the print carriage itself.

you do not need to remove it to move to each corner of the platform.  no error is introduced.  and the measure point is keyed and referenced to the thing that most matters, the print head.  this thing is for dial indicators with a mounting screw that is horizontal in the rear.

i made a derivative of that thing for use with dial indicators with a vertical mounting screw in the rear.  its here:


ok, i know this is a long shot, but on the off chance yall have a headspace gauge from innovative technologies, well, my thing is for you   i also included a jig for the end of the indicator's shaft so you don't have to remove the headapce gauge fixture.  simply print the jig from my thing and glue a 9mm 115g copper placed/jacketed round nose bullet in the socket.  the copper glides extremely smoothly across the build plate and also can easily take the heat.



leveling your bed with a dial indicator does not differ based on which mounting solution you chose.  the process is exactly the same.  the process is not about measuring any actual distance at all.  its about picking any corner of the bed (i chose front left as thats home for the taz) and then measuring how much difference there is between it and each of the other 3 corners.  and it really doesn't matter which corner you pick as home, just pick one and stick with it.  be consistent.

1:  heat bed to normal printing temps (to account for swelling and warping at working temp).

2:  move to the front left corner and zero.


3:  move to the front right and adjust hex screw until dial reads 0.



4:  return to front left and re-confirm zero.

5:  move to the back left and adjust hex screw until dial reads 0.


6:  return to front left and re-confirm zero.

7:  move to the back right and adjust hex screw until dial reads 0.


8:  confirm all 4 corners and make any minor corrections.

9:  finally check the center to confirm its near 0. it may or may not be zero depending on if your bed is sagging a little. at least you will know and by how much  


a:  replace the print head and re-adjust the z-stop as indicated in your taz manual.

and yes, as you can see, my bed is within half a thousanth of level.  cheers lulz  ","dutchhome wrote:i'm also using the second method shown above.  i find it works really well.  i have two problems..

first, it doesn't help with calibrating the two z axis motors.  it is very difficult using the ruler technique suggested by ao since there isn't a flat surface on the metal print bed subframe.  even if i home the y axis, there just isn't enough room.  i'm thinking of using something like the top gauge mount above to do this, but it hasn't bugged me enough to follow through on it.  instead, i use the little sliding clip on the ruler to lay on the metal tray and rest my chin on the desk to eye the bottom of the rail.

the other problem is that when using the gauge, since pronterface refuses to work without the thermistor attached i have to use the lcd panel to move the gauge around.  to get the plate height dialed in perfectly requires a lot of tweaking and i find the timeout on the lcd constantly fights me.  i'm not as interested in have a gcode script that moves it around as i am removing the lcd timeout so i have complete control over when it goes back to the top display.  this way i don't have to break away from tweaking the bed height to click through all the menus again and again.

btw, i mounted the digital gauge using a printed bolt and nut.. was pretty excited that all that i needed to buy was the dial indicator itself.

i agree measuring to the x axis rods from the aluminum bed per the instructions is essentially impossible to do accurately.

also the entire bed design of the taz is no good frankly. what's needed is an aluminum plate that has the heater element in it. that plate has the leveling screws in it, that pass through and have thumbscrews underneath it to level that plate. then the glass plate should sit on top of that (dropping into a machined recess to hold it in place. you could cut the glass to have handles on it that protrude beyond the heated leveling aluminum plate. this way when the print is done, you can simply remove the glass from the aluminum plate to cool more quickly. and you never lose level, or it is trivial to dial it back in."
taz frame hardware?,"hi all - i'm going to make an enclosure for my taz 5 and would like to frame my acrylic in the same metal parts and fittings as used in the printer

taz4 time left vs time elapsed,"hi!  just picked up a used taz4 on craigslist.  i had used one before at lcs, and we're very excited.

i'm wondering if we can get the display to show time left?  right now it shows time elapsed and a percentage bar.

thanks!","the printer is fed a line of code at a time so it has no idea how big an object is, whether or not printing will slow down (due to cooling) or anything else it needs to give a time estimate. it could be done i suppose but not easily."
taz 5 help! first layer failing pretty bad.,"okay so, i have a taz 5 and it is having a few different issues.

it is my first 3d printer so please bear with me.

the pla filament is grinding up inside the extruder, the extruder is clicking maybe every 2 minutes before grinding, the filament starts to print perfect on the first layer, but slowly degrades to a shredded type layer, then it becomes strands, which then the extruder stops extruding and grinds the filament. pla temp is the requested 205 head and 60 nozzle.

i have tried to level the bed and set the nozzle distance, but apparently it is off, but i am not sure in what direction, please advice me so i can get back to printing!

thank you for your time and advice.","from the bit of waviness on the top left corner of the first layer, it may be that the first layer is a bit too close to the bed. that could cause that filament stripping over time. give that z-axis endstop screw an adjustment, just a quarter turn up at a time, and see if that helps the issue!"
taz4 y-axis won't move backwards?,"well, this is an odd one.  my y-axis won't move backwards (towards the endstop).  it seems to always think the endstop is triggered. i've tried disconnecting the physical endstop, using the x-axis endstop (briefly) in place of the y endstop, reloading the firmware.... nothing seems to work.

is my rambo dead?  all the other axes work fine, it's just the y axis that refuses.

maybe i'll try using the y-max pins instead (for a y-min).","yes brent, i know that - not a newbie here.  this problem began (or at least, i noticed it) when i ran my start gcode on a print:

g28;
g28 x0 y0;
g29 p5;

the bed would never actually home to 0 - and during the g29 command, would move forward as though it had homed.  it was acting as if the y-min endstop was being held down at all times - so any forward move (say, to +5.00y) would then immediately become ) again.

i would take a video but i jiggered the firmware to use a different pin for the endstop, which seems to have fixed the issue, and i don't want to re-flash it and switch the wiring back."
hexagon hot end clogged with hips,"my hex hot end is clogged with hips, ive tried leaving the heat on and forcing more filament through but but there is absolutely no movement. i cant do cold pulls or anything. what do i do? ive had this printer for 2 days now and havent had a single print yet. :'(","if there is no filament flow at all:
1.) turn temperature up to 250c and allow nozzle to reach temperature.
2.) open extruder idler.
3.) pull filament out of the extruder.
4.) trim off end of filament.
5.) push filament back down into the extruder and see if you can get any filament out. you can push fairly hard against the extruder to get this to work.
6.) pull filament back out, see if there is anything stuck to the filament and trim off again.
7.) repeat process several times to see if you can get nozzle flowing again.


if there is flow but it seems partially blocked, thin or is coming out of the nozzle all twisty:
1.) using either hips or pla turn your nozzle to the proper temperature for that material.
2.) once up to temperature, extrude several mm of filament.
3.) turn your temperature down, for hips use 140c
4.) once the temperature is reached, open the extruder idler and pull out the filament.
5.) you should have a perfect mold of the inside of the hot end. the end of the filament should taper to a cylinder that is the size of your nozzle and have a nozzle sized cylinder that is about 1mm long.
6.) check for foreign particles or gaps in your mold of the nozzle.
7.) repeat steps as necessary to clean out nozzle.

if you can't get filament into the hot end, use the filament as a depth gauge to determine how far into the extruder/hot end it can travel and post a picture showing that."
"hexagon hot end clogged already, any tips to unclog?","an hour and thirty minutes into my first print on that hot end after upgrading my taz4 i have a clogged hot end. i was printing with abs at 233 c. any tips on how to unclog the new hotend?

also does anyone know a foolproof way to get the nozzle off without damaging the hot end? if i can carefully take the whole thing apart i will clean it that way.","holy cow!  i have had my taz5 for a week now and its been running almost constantly.  i have run lots of abs, pla even a failed nylon (didn't adhere to the bed) as well as some flex ecopla and laywood.  not one clog yet.  i clean the tip pretty well with acetone after each print though.  maybe that's keeping it happy.

makergeeks sells some fine wire (0.303mm) you could use to unclocg it. 
http://www.makergeeks.com/exflsehounmu.html

 i would look around for .30mm copper wire though.  the mg wire is steel and i believe the nozzle is brass.  over many uses i suspect it would enlarge the extrusion tip hole.  copper is softer than brass so it wouldn't have as great effect on it but its softer and would be harder to push through."
taz 5 usability,"can anyone give me an idea (or point me towards a source) that will help me understand just how difficult it is to use the taz 5 if i have never owned a 3d printer before?  lulzbot seems to really try and push first time users towards the mini but i want the bigger build envelope and option to go to two heads.

i consider myself technically savvy and i don't have a problem reading technical documentation and searching the web for solutions.  i do my own home wiring (including 240v) and i'm a decent amateur coder.  on the other hand, i don't have any electronics experience.

thoughts?

many thanks.","it depends upon how patient you are. its hard to go wrong with aleph, as they have great support, and the lulzbots are great printers. that said, they are much better printers if you invest time in the actual process, which requires an understanding of how the various slicers work, and how to tweak for materials.

there are so many factors that go into getting successful prints: bed temperature, extruder temperature, feed rates, variable layer thicknesses, and so on, and this stuff takes time and experience to successfully navigate. eventually, it will all make sense, but it can be a wild ride getting there, not to mention expensive, at least in terms of materials. 

adding to the complexity is the fact that you are creating physical objects from digital data using a manufacturing process. there are forms that are going to cause you trouble, and if you understand how to break down these forms and simplify for the process, you can mitigate those issues and get a good print. guys like james bruton of x robots offer great youtube videos that really help. understanding that you rarely will print something complex as a single part is a great start. in fact, if you look at the whole process as printing a series of parts for later assembly, you will already be on the road to success in many cases (though not all.)

materials choice is another topic altogether, and that is often driven by what you are intending to use your parts for. i am not a fan of pla, for example, but it does have its uses. abs is very sturdy as a material, and great for constructing mechanical things, but is very fussy and requires very well balanced temperatures at build time, lest the part warps and lifts at the base. other materials have their own issues, and in some cases, require special print heads (like ninjaflex, though some may argue that point). 

then there are the mechanics and design of the actual printer. lulzbots are great, but in order to keep costs reasonable, precision can become an issue. we are dealing with very tight tolerances, so a very minor error in the range of a tenth of a millimeter can present problems when propagated throughout a complete part. harmonics of the motors can cause minute ripples which may be objectionable to some, and you can see many topics here that address these and other issues. if you're mechanically inclined, then you may have the skills already to help you deal with them.

i started with an industrial resin printer, and was not happy with the quality i was getting. i added a makerbot replicator 2, and after a few hundred dollars of upgrades, got it to be very reliable -- however, that was only for pla, which doesn't work as well afterwards, as it easily melts when drilled or filed.  i got the taz5 due to what i saw bruton doing, as he addresses many of the issues you may encounter, and offers some solutions. i knew what i was getting into by this point, and i, for one, and very happy with my results so far. 

my next step is to build an enclosure to help maintain the temperature in the build envelope, and get good abs prints with no warping (hopefully.) 

hope this helps!"
enclosure for taz5,"hi all newbie here.  i ordered a taz 5 but have not gotten it yet.  

for my printing needs dimensional accuracy is a top priority. i've been planing to build an enclosure for the printer.  i wonder how many of you have your printer in an enclosure and how it has helped for part accuracy and minimize warping, shrinking and just overall failed prints. any feed back you guys have would be appreciated. 

the prototypes i do are pretty highly detailed mechanical assemblies with lots of small parts. (toy scale) i bought the taz 5 to spam my dimension sst1200es parts and maybe over time replace it.  at first my intention is to use the lulzbot when and if the part tolorances are not as importanint.  for example if i need to make a bunch of custom hot wheel.  i want to use mostly abs & hips for printing i don't really like the workability of pla.  i'm also hoping the new pet material is a good alternative. supost to be easy to print like pla but stronger than abs.  but not sure how well it glues with super glue. anyone know how well it glues with ca?","toymaker wrote:looks pretty good.  maybe i will follow your lead and use this design as a starting point and tweak it to my preference like your doing.  i do like the printed brackets it would save a lot of time, but i think lazer cut panels is overkill driving your cost way up.  but will be a breeze to assemble.   i'm thinking of using petg for the panels acrylic is pretty brittle. did you go with acrylic? if so i would go thicker than 1/8.  also the door opening is pretty small.  

please post when you finish yours.  

thanks for the input.

i did go with acrylic, 1/4: thick. i wanted an unobstructed view from any angle. i did add a second door on the right side, but kept it the same size. also, because this is essentially a cake box, if the doors are too small i can always just lift it off the taz if i need to work on it with more room.

i wanted laser cut because of the tight tolerances and clean finish. the doors will fit nice and tight since they are being cut with a shared line on two sides, leaving just 2mm total clearance (1mm all around).

regarding the printed parts, they are nice. the only issue is the corner bracket is messed up (on that thingverse page) so i remodeled that one. (i found out later he fixed it and posted it elsewhere after the fact) if you want me to post my version of it here i can. also i don't know how well the hinges will hold up over time. i ended up reprinting the hinge part with the rod, and did the top 60% of that at 100% infill. there will be a lot of stress on those. i don't know if they will break or not. it might be better to go with metal hinges for the doors.

i should have the panels on friday and will assemble it this weekend. if it goes together without any problems i will post the dxf file of my panel drawings. then anyone can get them cut, or mod it to there liking.

first layer,"so below is an image of my first layer. the perimeter prints pretty clean but the infill is rough. any tips on how to fix this? i assume this is over extrusion. also this is a taz 4 printing in pla

taz 5 extruder issue.,"so i was in the middle of a fairly large print.  i left for about a half an hour, and when i returned the printer was clogged.  so i tried the cold pull and everything i could think of.   i've tried scraping it, trying to get safety pins in, etc....  now i have taken the thing apart down to the extruder.   i took off the screw that was on the heat sink, and it fell and i lost it.   i really need to get this thing working soon, it's been out of commission for almost a week now.  can i continue to try to unclog the extruder, or is that small bolt on the heat sink really important?  any help at this point would be greatly appreciated.

new taz 5 adhesion issue,"i have had my taz 5 for several weeks now. i seem to have the bed leveled reasonably well, and small prints come out just fine. whenever i try to do anything bigger than about 3 inches across, or parts with thin sections, they come loose during printing. items with sharp angles almost always come loose in the corners. i thought that maybe it had something to do with the filament i am using, hips from lulzbot, so i have now tried abs and pla, also from lulzbot, but they come up just the same as the hips. i have been cleaning the pei surface with isopropyl alcohol between printings. i have tried printing parts on different areas of the bed. i have experimented with many different temperatures. but it is always the same. 

i understand that building an enclosure might help, but is there perhaps something else i am doing wrong?

should it be necessary to use some other material like glue or lulzjuice to get prints to stick to pei?

i do plan to get some sort of enclosure put up, but this case seems extreme. any advice would be appreciated.

thanks","adjusting nozzle height and brim are both good starts... i've heard of sanding the pei, but only to remove gloss on diy sheets or removing gouges.  sanding is a one way street, can't get back the pei material you remove.

get the nozzle closer to the print bed.  use the z-end stop knob to get the initial setting (business card should pass between nozzle and bed with a little friction), then tweak by .1-.2 through the z-offset in gcode... for projects with large surface areas on the bed usually.  or if need more adhesion use negative values. 

raise the temp of your bed.  for abs, try 110c for the first layer then dropping to 80-100c later in the project.

brim helps to keep the air from seeping in under the project... 8-10mm brim is what i like.  

for really stubborn warp issues, breaking up the airflow or blocking airflow at corners help.  hard to describe... but after the brim is printed and a few layers of the actual project, take a post-it note or blue painters tape and fashion a temporary wall to block the air in the y-axis.  i put the tape on the brim and bend up to form the ""wall"" at about 10-15mm away from the actual print... make sure it doesn't block the nozzle & fan."
filament broken way down,"hello,

thanks.","kcchen_00 wrote:you'll probably need to remove the extruder from the tool head mount and grab what's left of the filament with tweezers or pliers.  the extruder assembly is held to the tool head through two screws accessible from the bottom of the tool head mount.

here some basic instructions:
- raise the tool head to the top of the z-axis.
- be aware of the wires connecting the toolhead... you can disconnect these, but keep in mind to remove the actual filament you'll need to heat up to 220c.
- remove the fan duct assembly from the mount.  you might be able to get away with loosening the back screw and removing the front screw.
- unscrew the two screws on the bottom of the mount
- the extruder assembly can now be removed.
- the filament should be sticking out from the hotend... heat up the hotend to 220c and remove the filament.

squeaky x-axis,"hi

"taz'clone' sporting a 2w laser cutter, the l?z16","i recently attached my early https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/l-ch ... /x/7387042 indegogo reward of a lcheapo laser to my taz'clone' with 16"" bed which i now call the l?z16.

using slic3r to slice the outside edge of a stl file i have the l?z16 cutting multiple layers by increasing the height of the sliced model by 0.1mm. for example, a single cut pass would use a model height of 0.1mm and a three cut pass would use a model height of 0.3mm.

i wired a spare thermistor to the laser module to keep from getting temp errors when the laser head is installed rather than the extruder head. other than that i turned off the thermistor value for the heated bed in the firmware so that i could remove the heated bed plate to lighten up the yaxis for lasing duty.
this laser cutter has cut construction paper, balsa wood, bass wood, vinyl label, duct tape lables, card board, poster board, some plastics, and anything i can think to put under the knife.   





i noticed a few other people in the indiegogo campaign with taz machines also so we should see a few more of these laser cutting tazs coming online soon.

new taz 5 owner unboxing experience,"new taz 5 owner here, nice to meet you all.  i received my taz 5 a few days ago and wanted to share some concerns with the unboxing, just in case it might help some others.

first and foremost after spending time setting up and tuning the printer, i am in love.  it is fast, solid, and produces wonderful prints.  it will be replacing my reprappro multicolor as my primary printer and so far it is doing that job very well.

for the unboxing, the printer was packed very well, and arrived without any damage to the packing materials.  most of the issues i experienced seem to be related to the factory assembly and testing of the machine.  i suspect lulzbot has a large demand for the new taz 5 and might be a little overwhelmed.

issues:

#1 - one of the glass bed holders was badly bent, and made it impossible to level the bed.  i had to print a replacement holder on my older printer.  once i print the replacement leveling the bed was easy.  the fact that this made the bed unlevelable surprised me as the bed is supposedly leveled at the factory for the test print, there is no way the printer would have passed that test.

#2 - the x-axis belt pinion was very loose.  the pinion would freely rotate 10 degrees on the shaft.  this also would not have allowed the test print to succeed.  i tightened the pinion allen screws and had no further issues with this.

#3 - the left z-axis lead screw nut was bound so tight the motor would miss 3/4 of its steps.  this was the biggest issue.  in reviewing the forum, this seems to be a common issue and customer support recommends loosening some of the lead screw mounting screws to remove the binding.  i did not want loose screws on my new printer so instead i used brass shim material to create a 0.1"" shim for the back side of the lead screw mount.  this removed all binding and allowed all screws to remain tight.

what concerns me most about this is that with these issues there should have been no way for the test print to have completed, so i am wondering if the octopus that was shipped with my printer really came from my printer?

i knew that the taz was focused towards the more advanced group of users and that i would be taking it apart to upgrade it at some point, but still i expected the full product to have had a little more qc on it before going out the door, not just checking the boxes on the included qc sheet.

in summary, i love my taz.  it is a first class 3d printer and i would recommend it to anyone.  also lulzbot has first class support and a huge helpful user base that also makes it easy to recommend to anyone.  but had i been a more novice user, i might have returned the printer fearing the quality based on my unboxing experience.

lulzbot - keep up the great work and thanks for the awesome printer!

steven","sigh.  i have rewritten this post a few times trying to improve my tone, but have been unsuccessful, so here is the short version.

first i am not new to this technology.  i have many 3d printers and i use them daily to support my friends in the special needs community and their unique needs.  i own and run 2 cnc mills (bridgeport, taig), a 9"" southbend lathe and a software consulting company.  all this to say, the technology is not new, i am used to setting up machines that have tolerances measured in the thousandths of an inch, and with owning my own company i am sensitive to the complexity of operations lulzbot has to deal with, and the importance of solid customer support.

up until this response by lulzbot i have been beyond impressed with the company and how they treat their customers before and after the sale.  i wrote this unboxing thread not to seek anything from lulzbot, but to inform new users what kinds of complications they might run into, and possible solutions to those problems.  i made sure to highlight that if there was something they could not handle lulzbot customer support would be sure to help them make things right.  when i mentioned that i was in doubt that the octopus in my box came from my printer, it was based on the fact that my printer as delivered could not print that octopus.

when a lulzbot representative offered to take a look into things via my serial number i of course provided him any information he needed, not because i was looking for anything as i had already solved all my problems, but because if it could help track down any holes in the qc process it was worth my time to help out so that another customer would have a better unboxing experience.

when i saw the response from engineering i was appalled that it was not sanitized before posting it to a public forum as it is very aggressive towards the customer (me).  it opens with a statement saying they approach everything as a fault on their end, then pointed out every reason why they did not believe me.  i suspect i am adding tone to the engineering report, but as i am the customer who expected his $2,200 turn key printer to work with minimal assembly and calibration, my reaction is of the most important to lulzbot.  it pissed me off.  it took a customer that was beyond happy, recommending the company to everyone who asked, to a pissed off dude.

of course i had the issues i wrote about, why would i spend time documenting the issues and resolutions if it did not happen?

i am going to close this post with some supporting pictures and additional information, then go print some kick butt stuff on my taz 5.

one of the glass bed holders was badly bent.

it was not the tab, it was the holder.  yes the bed was taped.  i am assuming that the tape was too aggressively applied which compressed the bed holder past the point of the spring, which caused the holder to bend the holes where the 2 screws go through it to the point of delamination.  fortunately this also caused the tab to spin out of the way and kept the glass from cracking.  unfortunately i did not take a picture of the part before tossing it as i had a new one printed up on my other printer in 15 minutes.

the x-axis belt pinion was very loose. 

i have attached the picture which shows the octopus where this was happening.  you can clearly see it in the body section.  my assumption based on what the engineering report said was that the set screw was not tightened into the center of the shaft flat but was caught on the very edge of the flat.  this would have allowed the printer to work during qc but was dislodged during shipping or final assembly.  this moved the set screw into the open flat area which allowed the many degrees of slippage.



 x pinion slipping 

the left z-axis lead screw nut was bound so tight the motor would miss 3/4 of its steps.

i have attached a picture of the octopus that was print before i fixed the z and one that was print after.  as you can see in the picture the first octopus was 0.064"" shorter.  thats 1.63mm, or about 5.5 layers short.  the left z axis was the one that was bound so it actually missed closer to 12 layers worth of movement to cause that discrepancy.  when i homed the printer after that print the right size of the bed showed a large gap when moving the hotend over it.  pulling out the height gauge you could see that the x beams were no longer parallel to the y plane, this proved the left z binding.  my assumption based on the engineering report is that the z axis is very touchy, this makes sense as lead screw nuts tolerate very little misalignment.  i am in virginia, the printer was tested in colorado.  maybe there was enough difference in humidity, barometric pressure, etc that cause the binding.  what is clear is that the taz needs some better alignment capabilities for the z leadscrew nut.



 z offsets, note the second pic is the bad print and was shorter hence the negative movement of the dial indicator. 


sorry for the rant, i am happy that engineering was involved as that means they take customer concerns seriously, but the tone of the response just hit a sore nerve i guess.

happy printing!

max stepper temperature,"was doing a print with my taz 5 and noticed that the x/y axis steppers where pretty warm.  using an ir thermometer i get the following on each stepper.

x:  65c 
y:  65c
z1:  45c
z2:  45c
extruder: 55c

just curious if this is normal.","from the specs for the steppers:

they can run at 100 °c!

so they can and will run hot, but unless you are over-driving your printer they should be fine. or you have it in a really hot enclosure, that will not allow sufficient cooling of the steppers."
single extruder tool head v2 and taz 3.1,"i have a lulzbot taz 3.1, though i am planning to print and purchase the parts to upgrade my printer with taz 4 parts.  i saw that lulzbot is advertizing the ""lulzbot taz single extruder tool head v2"", but only specifies installation on taz 4 printers.  while i am sure one could make the new tool head fit on any taz version printer, i am wondering what modifications(if any are necessary) are needed to make the new tool head work with the taz 3.1.

i saw a link to the lulzbot facebook page from my searches, where lulzbot claims the v2 tool head is an upgrade for the taz 1-4(https://www.facebook.com/lulzbot/posts/851143804944912), but no specifics on how much work and what alterations(if any) would be needed.  on the taz 3.1 part, i see two connectors, though i want to say the video i watched on the tool head installation mentioned four connectors.  would the walkthrough on the fangtooth tool head(https://ohai-kit.alephobjects.com/proje ... -toolhead/) give some idea of the installation work necessary?

my apologies if there has already been a post on this topic.  i didn't find it through the search function on this forum, nor through three different search engines.","instructions are available here:

taz 5 extruding issues,"ok, i have been printing for awhile and no issues but then i opened a new package of hips filament. when i tried to print it printed the first few things but then it began printing everything very thin and fragile. it seems to be under extruding. now, i even tried to change back to another filament but it is still not extruding the right amount. please help.","hmm... any clicking from the gears is bad. i'm not that familiar with the wade's setup to help... i guess i would start with a visual inspection if the two herringbone gears to make sure nine of the teeth are broken.  then move on to checking that bolts and grub screws are tight... make sure not to bind the hobbed bolt (the big gear should be easily turned when the stepper motor is off).

check that the filament moves through the extruder and hotend without binding.  remove the filament and nozzle.  let the hotend cool down.  with the idler open, push the filament all the way through and check for any resistance.  there have been reports that something may be binding in the pathway a affecting pla... possibly the aluminum plate shifted somehow."
moving spool to left hand side of taz 5?,"i just got my taz 5 this week and am about to build an enclosure.  in the assessment of what i need access to i decided:
* sd card slot
* power switch
* print bed
* extruder
* spool holder

which got me thinking, why not move the spool holder to the left side of the printer?  i don't see anybody doing this, probably folks are moving away from the holder.  i'm not there yet, so just wanted to make the printer slightly more compact.  things to consider for moving:
1) electronics are on the left
2) front frame has the lcd so putting spool there blocks sd card slot
3) could mount on back frame towards top
4) filament feeder might need something to mount to

i *think* that with the spool mount moved and something for the filament feeder to mount to it could work.

your thoughts on this are greatly appreciated!","perhaps to remove both spool mounting and filament feeder mounting concerns, simply put the spool in front of the power supply on a spool holder.  the spools i have are 8"" diameter, which is plenty of clearance between the power supply and front of the bed.  with a little extra in the enclosure it wouldn't be snug at all.  and about 8"" of width can be removed from the final enclosure dimensions.  filament feeder can be mounted on the front left vertical frame bit."
rambo 15a heated bed fuse keeps burning out.,"i noticed my bed was not heating up about a week ago....after a little investigation, turns out the 15amp automotive style fuse blew., and i replaced it.

it worked for several days, but today it blew again as the bed was coming up to temperature.

is this just gonna happen occasionally, or is something possibly wrong? our voltage in this area is known to dip down a little, so maybe that is increasing the current. i might try a voltage regulator.

can i go to a larger fuse? or should i just stock up on them.","well i have been doing test on the heat bed recently mainly testing every bed for the next batch of printers but also any rmas we get in trying to find out why they failed,stop working,blow fuses. originally i was just testing or rather looking at each bed with a thermal camera to see there was any thing wrong thermally. usually test on a bed would only last about 15 mins or so. however after over a 150 heat beds i had blown at least 2 fuses, 2 melted connectors, and had wire that had melted threw its insulation and shorted out blowing out another fuse i started to look at what the power each bed was pulling. 

sadly it looks like a good heat bed has a resistance of 0.65 ohms at room temp, and around 0.8 when at 85c. that means as the bed heats up it pulls more than 15a for at least a minute every time you turn it on. which is not necessarily bad but not great either. i have recently found out that fuses don't immediately blow right after the current goes over their rating, how far the current goes over the rating determines how long it will take. for example the fuse we ship with the taz (http://www.littelfuse.com/data/en/data_ ... tof-cn.pdf) for current at 110% the rated current(16.5a) it can take at least 100 hours for the fuse to blow. at 135%(20.25a) it can take as long as 10 minutes for the fuse to blow. for the taz since the high current last only a little while on a good bed it can take as many as 10,000 cycles of heating up the bed up from room temperature for the fuse to blow. for beds that have a resistance of less than than 0.65 ohms at room temp they can pull a decent amount of current. one bed i tested was only 0.56ohms and pulled as much as 18.5a at room temperature. it managed to melt the connector on the test rambo i was using before the fuse blew and before i could turn off the power.  

so switching to a higher rated fuse would mean that the fuse might not blow, but the next weakest link in the system which could be anything from the rambo connectors to the wire to the heat bed or even the quick connects attached to the switch.

the only  decent solution i have come up, besides trying to use a huge bulkly 200w resistor in series with the bed, is to use pid control for the heat bed. for the default firmware with that shipped with the taz we just used bang bang control, basily on-off. using the pid in the firmware we can in sense limit the voltage to the bed, and indirectly limit the current the bed pulls. the hard part for me has been deciding/testing how much to try limit the current so that all heat beds, good, bad and weird would still be able to at least reach 85c in a reasonable amount of time, yet as low as possible so to try and get the current as far under 15a as possible. i will try and post a link, probably tomorrow, to the firmware i have have been testing so you can look at it. right now i think have the pwm limit set to 242 out of 255, kp=650, ki= 60 and kd=1850. since you would be doing this for a single machine you could very easily try something lower. without knowing the resistance of you bed, but based on how long it takes a fuse to blow you could try something around 220 and see if you can still reach 85c.

tl;dr no on bigger fuse, firmware can help, and sorry for the wall of text."
heat resistors keep burning out,"first off, i own a kittaz, but since there are more taz owners, i wanted to find out if anyone else has had this problem, or if anyone can recommend a solution.  

i am using pronterface, i set the extruder temperature, usually between prints, i.e. i'm taking one print off the bed, the temp was set to 0 when the print finished, i set it back to 185 for pla, take off the print, something locks up and the temperature reading out on pronterface says 185 or close to it, but in reality it is in a heat run-away ultimately resulting in the heat resistor burning out.  this takes about 20 seconds.  i usually notice it when i see pla start leaking out (due to it being too hot).  once i see it, i turn off the printer immediately in an attempt to save the resistor, but i think i was only successful at doing this once, it just happens too fast. 

this has happened to me 6 times now.  so i am pretty proficient at replacing the heat resistors now.  lulzbot has been very responsive and has shipped me the 4 replacement heat resistors for free.  (started with 2, one in extra flexystruder)

things to note that may help with diagnosis:
1. the heat bed is also on a heat run-away, but it just doesn't fry out.
2. the thermistor is functioning correctly - when i turn the printer back on, the temp will refresh correctly and i can watch it fall (highest i have seen was ~247).  
3. it usually happens inbetween parts, not during the print (except once). 
4. happens sporadically, first time was dec-11, happened twice back to back, then worked for a month,  then on jan 14th, and 15th, then again on jan 23rd/24th.  i printed about 20 hours of objects between the 15th and the 23rd.  and about 8 hours of objects on the 24th, so it's not like i installed it and then it burned out, i usually get to print for a while first...  
5. i had a theory that it had to do with loading a part into pronterface while the temp was ramping, but have had it happen without loading a new part, so i'm not sure on that anymore.
6. i have another theory that it might have to do with running slic3r (generating gcode) while setting the temp, as i was doing this last time it burned out and i might have been on previous burn outs but i can't remember.  not sure exactly how this would have an impact, and it isn't consistent, but i definitely think it is sw based.
7. i have updated the fw with the latest without any modifications. 
8. i will upload my pronterface logs.  if anyone has advice on how to make these more verbose, or if there are other logs that i can look at, that would be great.

thanks,
james","i went up to lulzbot and got some help. i thought i'd post the results in case anyone else has a similar problem.

it looks like the first resistor burnt out because of the air gap around it in the heating block. the second probably burnt out so quickly because of less than stellar crimping on my part (but would likely have succumbed to the air gap issue soon enough).

lulzbot is working on their new hot ends (currently in the mini) to avoid these problems in the future. however, currently, the workaround was to wrap some copper mesh around the resistor to more efficiently conduct heat to the heating block. they have suggested the use of aluminum foil for the same thing, too. just be careful to make sure that the foil/mesh doesn't contact the leads on the resistor (or you will short it and may blow a fuse).

i'll be playing with the printer some more this weekend. many thanks to the lulzbot support team. they were a delight to visit and quite helpful. with their careful and patient explanations they have restored my faith in my printer."
hotend no longer heats up,"not sure what's going on: my taz worked for all of 3 prints before the hotend began to stop heating up, at all.

if i plug the power resistor into where the bed is usually connected, it'll begin to heat up. i even tried the following change in the firmware, around line 1330 in pins.h:
//edited here to make heater on extruder connect to heater 1 port instead
#define heater_0_pin 7 
//was 9
#define temp_0_pin 0

#define heater_1_pin 9
//was 7
#define temp_1_pin 1

am i missing something, or did i just buy a very expensive paperweight?","if your bed/nozzle is not heating, here are the things to check:

with the power off:

1. is everything plugged in? 

1a. ... the power supply to the wall? 
1b. ... the printer to the power supply? 
1c. ...the power input to the switch, and then to the rambo via the 6 pin connector? 

if you can move the motors, chances are all of these things are ok.

2. are all the screws on the 6 pin connector tightened, and are there any stray wire strands from one lead that might be causing a short to the other pins on the connector?

3. are all the screws on the 2 pin connectors for the bed and hotend tightened, and are there any stray wire strands from one lead that may be causing a short to the other pin in the connectors?

4. does the board output voltage to the bed and/or nozzle heating element? there are 2 leds near the output pins that should light up when voltage is applied. you can also set your multimeter to dc voltage and measure the output.

if the board does not output voltage, you may have a blown fuse. the fuse is there as a fail-safe, so if it has blown and it's not a faulty fuse, chances are there is some other issue that needs addressing or it will just blow the fuse again.

5. are the bed/hotend circuit closed or open? they should be neither.

the hotend heating element circuit wires are red and should read ~4.8 ohms, 
the bed heating element circuit wires are purple and should read ~1.6 ohms, 
the hotend thermistor circuit wires are orange, and should read ~100,000 ohms at room temp 
the bed thermistor circuit wires are yellow and should read ~100,000 ohms at room temp. 
you can check these by disconnecting the two-pin connector at the board and reading the resistance across the two pins.

if the hotend is not heating and the heating element circuit is reading open, then there is a chance that the heating element is blown. in this case, the 4.7 ohm heat resistor needs replacement. contact support@lulzbot.com or source your own if you prefer. to prevent this from happening, you can also remove the heating element and wrap it in foil and replace it, or reflash your firmware with a lower voltage being sent to the element (all future 24v taz will have this change made in the firmware at the factory as far as i know).

if the hotend is not heating and the heating element is reading a short, it is possible that the insulation around the element leads is not seated correctly and the current is flowing through the heater block and not the resistor.

6. is the problem in the heating element/thermistor itself, or the leads to the heating element/thermistor? check this by disconnecting the connector near the bed/hotend (two two-pins for the bed, one four-pin for the budaschnozzle) and measuring the resistance there, instead of at the place where it connects to the board.

7. is there continuity in the leads from the board to the heating element connector? set your multimeter to ohms and put one terminal on the connector on the board, and the other terminal on the connector near the heating element in question. it should read a small resistance, about the same resistance that is read when the two terminals of the multimeter are touched together -- usually about .1 ohms.

on older iterations of lulzbots, there was no strain relief for the bed or hotend leads, which led to failures due to flexing of the crimps which would loosen over time and open up the circuit. with the newer versions, there is a strain relief, so this failure mode is much less common, but still worth checking if there is not continuity or the correct resistance. you can remove the pins from the connectors by using a pokey thing to bend the retaining tab in and then pulling out the wire and pin for inspection. if everything seems ok, then bend the retaining tab back out a bit and push it back into the connector."
best practices to remove finished prints from print bed,"hi folks,

i am a newbie at printing and own a taz 5. so far my experience with it was great, but i sometimes have troubles getting my 3d prints off the print bed once the print is finished. i am printing hips at 240 (hot end) and 110 (print bed) so when it is finished i let the bed cool down to about 50 degrees before i try to get the print off the printer bed. so i was wondering if there were any good tips for retrieving my finished prints without destroying them or the pei surface with the clam knife. should i wait until the printer bed is completely cooled off? i wonder what the pros say ","kcchen_00 wrote:100-110c are the recommendations from lulzbot for the pei bed.

in general 85c should keep abs adhered pretty well to pei.  100-110c for the entirety of the project could cause discoloration of light colored abs.  i think at 100c, the abs is still malleable which could lead to warping or delamination.

if your slicing software supports multi-temps for the bed, start with 100c+ for the first few layers then drop to 80-85c...  best to gradually cool the bed down.  i think 70c is actually a good temp after the print reaches 20mm at which point the bottom layers shouldn't be affected by the top layers.

i tried that strategy for my latest hips print. started off with 110 and then set it to 85 but when i came back to check after a few hours i was greeted by the unholy spaghetti monster instead of seeing the progress i expected. the bottom disconnected from the print bed and my dear printer printed for 1.5 hours into the air producing a nice plastic tumbleweed. so i've restarted the print and won't touch the temp for the bed for now "
3rd extruder,"i noticed on my taz5 hmi that 3 hot end temps are listed.  i thought the rambo board could only control 2.  can you really connect 3 hot ends and extruders to this machine?  can the control wires for both additional hot ends and extruders go through the unused pin connector on the top of the electrical cabinet?
i'm definitely planning to add a 2nd extruder/hot end.  if 3 are possible i would consider that as well.","depends on the configuration of the printer too. rambo is a generic board for a variety of printers. a kossel style for example that only requires 3 motion motors would have an extra channel available for use as an extruder motor (the 2nd z axis motor on the taz) the lcd on the taz is adapted for the taz, but it is a model used on a variety of 3d printers as well. the generic part is known as the ""full graphic lcd"" and it has the 3 extruder icons as a default configuration option. 

your polished option is going to be a different board unfortunatly. that or losing one of the z axis motors which won't work all that well with a taz unless you link the two leadscrews to a central motor. thats doable, but would require a fairly major rework."
my taz 5 died,"i set up a print on the taz hit print everything started up fine and the part started printing. few min later i then turned on my other printer a stratasys dimension sst1200 es witch is plugged in to the same wall outlet. although i did not see it go off i think this is when the taz turned off and died.  is it possible this caused some sort of power surge and killed my taz?  it will not power up at all now it's totally dead i tried a different wall outlet with the same results. dead! 

did not find anything on this topic on aleph web site.  

anyone have any input?","it's possible that there is a blown fuse on the rambo board.  i'd personally send an e to the support guys at:  support@lulzbot.com  and see what they think.

taz 5 heat sink fan,"i own a lulzbot taz 5, i have had it for approximately 2 months. 

1) i've had maybe a hundred+ good prints, a comparable number of failures, and an unfortunate amount of debilitating jams.
2) i regularly level my print bed.
3) i clean my extruder thoroughly, before and after jams.
4) i keep my filament in a dry environment, practically swimming in little packs of silica gel.
5) i regularly swap out the 3mm hot end for a hexagon 1.75mm hot end (purchased 3rd party) when the hot end currently in use jams up and i need to soak it in acetone to clean it out.
6) up until today, i have exclusively printed with abs. (esun 3mm, hatchbox 1.75mm)
7) i love my machine.

the above now established, i will move on to the ""meat and potatoes"" of my post.

the first time i powered on my machine and heated the hot end, a tiny puff of smoke come out of the heat sink fan. it seemed to be operating properly, and being engrossed in the setup process and general excitement of getting started, i mindlessly thought nothing of it. i proceeded to use my machine with varying success for about a month.

one day, while soaking my hot end in acetone to clear out a jam, i began searching the forum for posts regarding whether or not it was possible to utilize 1.75mm filament with the stock hot end. i stumbled upon a few threads that suggested it was possible. having received a 3d printing pen as a gift a couple months prior to ordering my machine, i had a few rolls of 1.75mm filament handy and decided to give it a try. the filament buckled just past the hobbed bolt every time, and after a weekend of tinkering with it, i ended up ordering a 1.75mm hexagon hot end kit from a 3rd party website. i have been using it with the same varying rate of success as my 3mm hexagon. only swapping out the hot end, still using the stock heater and thermistor.

today, (after a jam in my 1.75mm hot end) i reattached my 3mm hotend and decided to try my luck printing with a roll of esun 3mm pla that i had received about a week prior. this being my first attempt at printing with pla, i was discouraged with the amount of trouble i've had. the extruder leaks so much that i have been unable to print even a 20mm cube without the extruder jamming. 

every time i either: 
1) insert filament into the pre-heated hot end, or 
2) slowly heat the hot end with filament inserted and then manually (from pronterface, or by hand) extrude some filament to get the end primed:

a vast quantity of filament rapidly leaks out of the nozzle. from what i can tell, this results in two things:

1) a cavity of air forms between the opening at the hobbed bolt and the nozzle, and / or
2) the nozzle ends up with either a giant glob of pla stuck to it, entirely coated in pla, or jammed up altogether.

i tried the following to remedy the leaking:

1) altering slic3r retraction settings, trying a number of configurations
--a) did not expect this to solve the problem, as the leaking occurred constantly. not just when printing
2) replaced the stock thermistor with the one that came with my 1.75mm kit
--a) thought maybe the stock thermistor was malfunctioning and the hot end was going past the ~205c i was setting it at

neither of these things solved the problem. 

i got my hands on an infrared thermometer and everything became clear to me. with my hot end set at 205c, the heat sink just below the mounting plate was reaching ~160-170c. heat is creeping up my hot end assembly.

i am now reminded of the tiny puff of smoke that came from my heat sink fan at the time of my initial set up and i am inclined to believe the fan has not been operating consistently since. 

i am hoping that this is the source of the issues i have been experiencing, as replacing a fan sounds a lot easier than everything else i've been doing.

hoping i can get my hands on a replacement heat-sink fan.","the 1.75 hexagon did come with a 5v box fan, but unfortunately no duct or any apparent way to mount it.
--
i cleaned the pla jam out of my 3mm hexagon this morning with a power drill, very carefully. i first used a 1/8 inch bit to clean out the pla from the top opening to the beginning of the threaded tube into the heater block. i then used a 5/64 inch bit to bore about .5cm into the pla which was occupying the tube and heater block down to the nozzle. i then slowly backed the bit out of the hot end with the piece of pla stuck to the end it. pictures are in the link below.

this afternoon i contacted lulzbot support, they're going to be sending me a replacement fan. but in the meantime, i found this duct http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:439772 and successfully printed it with the 3mm hexagon using abs, without a heat-sink fan. i'm in the process of attempting to attach the 3rd party 5v box fan using this mount. i don't particularly like the design and that it has direct contact with the heat-sink, so i may just opt to not print pla until i get the stock fan from lulzbot. see the link below for pictures of the print.

so! here is my situation and questions.

i am looking to get a loan (yes a loan) to buy a 3d printer and supplies and to dive head first in to printing for others and myself because i have a many goals and many projects that i am aiming for. because i know 3d printing would make many of my processes go faster. i have also looked in to quite a few printers and the print size of the lulzbot taz 5 comes close but i still need bigger and its open source which is a big advantage. i love me open source. so!

q...lulzbot taz 5 if i buy this within a few months will there be something bigger or better???

is the dual extruder worth it???

what is the best material to print with when selling right off the print bed. meaning if i print a custom figure or a replacement plastic part or a custom fixture, ect. ???

can i expand the lulzbot taz 5 printing bed area???

will the ninjaflex be a good material to print drive belts and other functioning parts like that???

i heard the taz 5 can print very fine after tuning what can be the finest that it can conceptually print  (mm or inches are fine)???

i like the tie die nylon filament look how harsh is that on the standard provided nozzles??? 

what supplies will be needed for starting out (generally speaking) ???

what parts goes out or need to be replaced often to keep on hand???

filament how much should i start with???

any one know any medium to large scale 3d scanners they could recommend???

what tools if any would i need that may not be provided that comes in handy or is crucial???

i have a few threaded designs that does not need high tolerance but pretty close will this be a problem to print???

i have a great sander/grinder i made what are good sanding grits to have on hand???

once i get in to this process i know i'll have many more questions so i hope no one will be heavily aggravated with me or my questions. i will search your posts to see if the answers will be there before i ask but for now i hope i can rely on the community too.

thanks and happy 3d printing.

i have a taz 4 that i have been upgrading and mad science-ing on for about a year now.  from what i can tell, the taz 2-5 are relatively similar to each other - essentially evolutionary changes, not revolutionary. upgrading a taz3 to a taz5 spec isn't that difficult. elsewhere on the forum, there's a thread about kauri, which is the next generation taz - it seems to be quite different in terms of structure, but i'm also quite happy with my taz 4, i don't think you would be upset with a taz5.

is the dual extruder worth it???

this one is a bit weird for me to answer - i previously had a lulz-style dually mounted on my printer, and recently switched it out for a thing-of-my-own-design.  the lulz dually, to me at least, caused me a lot more headaches than it should have. leveling the nozzles is annoying, but more importantly it's just really heavy. there's a good deal of flex in it - and paired with the stock smooth rods that hold it, there's a good deal of wobble. i replaced all my smooth rods with hardened ones, and all the pillow bushings/bearings with ball bearings -- much more rigid now.  my new extruder works with the e3d chimera (a dual-nozzle single-heatsink jobby) and a dglass 3d hpx2-max extruder. the hpx2max is nice because it uses only a single, small stepper motor - along with a servo - to drive two filaments. it's rigid, the nozzles are always levelled because they fit in the same heatsink, etc.

all that said, get a dual extruder. maybe not immediately - get used to printing with a single extruder first - but dissolvable support is heavenly.

pla tends to be easier - except for one major thing, which is heat creep. in all-metal hotends, for some reason, pla tends to jam. there's a couple fixes i've heard, namely 'seasoning' the hotend by coating a small amount of filament in oil. the other is to use thermal paste on the heatbreak and nozzle threads when assembling, but i haven't tried this.

abs is great, but does require a bit more effort at first - i personally use a very thick abs/acetone slurry, atop pet tape. pla can be printed on the bare glass bed, or use a gluestick to put a thin coating on the glass. i actually usually use a mixture of wood glue (pva) and water to coat my bed for pla.

the taz 5 has a pei build surface, which i haven't used but is apparently great for a lot of materials.
neotron wrote:

yes. it won't be easy, but i don't see why you couldn't. you'd need wider aluminum extrusions, wide smooth rods, different belts, lots of stuff.
neotron wrote:

i've printed at .06mm layer height on my taz4, using an e3d all-metal hotend.  takes forever but man does it look good.
neotron wrote:

i don't think nylon is particularly harsh on the nozzle - something like the carbon fiber infused pla filament will destroy a brass nozzle very quickly, however.  the biggest problem i've had with nylon is adhesion - to both itself and the bed.
neotron wrote:
what supplies will be needed for starting out (generally speaking) ???


assuming they're for sale, i would suggest getting another pei surface.  i actually have two print beds now - one i use for abs, one for pla/soft filaments. for the glass and the heater i think it's about $90 total.

you'll also want some acetone, and a few acetone safe bottles. i now have a supply of zip ties, a lot of various m bolts, springs, connectors, etc - because i am apparently addicted to modding my printer.
neotron wrote:

firs thing i would do after getting used to printing, is print some more extruder gears (they should be on the sd card that came with the printer) - i've had a few of these fail, or nearly fail on me, and it's a pain to be out of commision while you try and source more. i'd also suggest, if you're going to be modding the printer, to buy a bunch of the littelfuse fuses (i don't have the model number off-hand, sorry). i've 'killed' my printer by accidentally shorting a fan connection briefly - i just blew the fuse, but with no extras on hand the printer was dead until i got more.

other than that, nothing has ever broken on my printer.
neotron wrote:

where i live, matterhackers is about an hour and a half car ride away from me - so i get most of my filament from them, because it's free shipping and it gets here the next day. i would say get a roll of pla, and a roll of abs, to start. once you're more accustomed to printing you can get more colors or find more interesting materials.
neotron wrote:

digital calipers. i have two and i need more - i want one in every corner of my apartment. needle nose pliers, wire cutters.
neotron wrote:i am not for sure what bowden is?

the taz's come with a 'direct drive' (ish) extruder - essentially the filament leaves the gears/motor section and goes directly into the hotend, and that's it. a bowden system has the extruder (the gears and motors) mounted on the frame of the printer, with a ptfe tube leading from there to the hotend/nozzle. the benefit of a bowden is that the x-carriage is much lighter - it doesn't have to pull a heavy motor around. the downside is that soft filaments (like ninjaflex) essentially can't work in them, they'll kink up. you get a lot more oozing of filament with a bowden, so you need a much higher retraction to prevent it.  i ran my chimera extruder as a bowden briefly while i waited for the hpx extruder to arrive - i did actually manage to get it printing soft pla, which was surprising, but overall bowden felt like more trouble than it was worth. i also found myself wasting a lot more filament, because the stuff left between the extruder and the hotend was a bit chewed up from the extruder."
is this a z-wobble issue?,"excuse me if i am using the wrong terminology, but i just got into 3d printing and i am still attempting to calibrate my taz 5.  the print i am currently using for calibration purposes is this 15 mm cube (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:25093).  the vertical surfaces are not very smooth and from a few google searches, i think it could possibly be a wobble issue within the z axis.  i squared up the x axis with the frame, as best as i could, but i didn't see a noticeable effect. 

here is a picture of my latest print, with the x axis squared.

i'm in a jam!!,"i just received my lulzbot taz 5 everything assembled and level.  however, i was never able to complete a print, outside of the bed calibration print.  any time i tried a print, the gear would eat through the filament.  i tried various slicers and profiles, temperatures, and hobbed bolt tensions, but the end result was always the same.  

i was content to tinker and attempt to find the solution myself, until this caused a length of filament to break beneath the gear, in an area, where i can't even get needle nose pliers on the filament.  basically i have a length of filament that i can't extrude and i probably a clogged nozzle at this point.

if its plugged in wrong, chances are the little fan is bad from too high a voltage.

taz 5 low spot in bed from heater wires,i have my bed corners level but there is a very pronounced low spot where the wired for the heater attach.  i have tried adjusting the length and position of he zip tie but have only had moderate success.  what is everyone else doing to correct this issue?,"kcchen_00 wrote:when i first got the taz 5, there was a spot on the glass/pei bed which looked like it was seperating (air bubbles).  figured out later that it was from the silicone heater.  didn't think much about it... though i did press on the bottom to validate that it was the silicone heater.  i'd be surprised it was enough to put a dip in the glass... but it could be possible.

adhesion problems?,"hello,

i'm trying to print a large piece that stretches from side to side. it laid down the first layer no problem, but when going on to the second layer was getting poor layer adhesion and lifting up. glad i caught this on the second layer as this is a 30 hour print job! when i used my ir thermometer it shows that on the edge of the bed, the temperature is roughly 75c where i have it set at 95c. as i get closer in, it gets to that 95c so it appears that the edge of the print bed is not getting hot enough. i'm assuming that this is the problem of my problem? the picture shows that after a bit, it gets hot enough that it can stick well. 

any ideas of how to fix this??

thanks everyone in advance!","wow... that's a big first few layers.  is that abs?  i'll give you mu !ethod of tackling it... ymmv 

try bumping up the bed a few degrees... for abs i like 110c or 105c.  don't let the bed temp drop below 100c until the 5 or 10 layers.  for a print that big, i'd wait until 3-5mm (if layer height is .2, then 60 layers).  during the first layers don't use the fan, let the abs cool and firm up on its own.  

at 3mm if no warping, it should be ridged enough to resist warping from the contraction of upper layers. start the fan at 30% and lower the filament extrusion temp by a few degrees... at this point in the project you want to help cool the new layers to minimize the shrinkage as the abs cools.  at this point in the print you have to be carefuk about delamination from too low an extrusion temp or low flow rate of filament.  ambient temperature temps play a part here also and an enclosure would help greatly.

if you can maaake the print smaller, use a brim.  the brim helps ""seal"" the project edge from drafts... if air gets under the leading edge of the print, you'll get warping.

lastly, try fine tuning the initial nozzle height.  use the z-offset in the slicing software to lower the nozzle by -.05 to -.1mm.  you'll never achieve this through the end stop knob... use the software offset to your advantage.

good luck and report back with the finished product! "
print bed leveling,"i'm new to this and don't have a taz yet.  planning to order a taz5 at the end of april.  so excuse this rookie input if it's already been covered.
since bed must be level relative to the xy plane, why not let the head xy axis print the bed leveling supports?
with no glass print base or corner blocks in place, print four corner ""donut"" leveling spacers directly on the base frame itself. print enough layer thickness or number of layers to make the four corners level.   then place glass plate corner supports on those printed donut leveling spacers and secure with studs/bolts/whatever.
see attachment. the corner blocks would need to insulate the printed spacer donuts from any plate heat. seems maybe a quick and easy enough initial step if it works.




","there are socket cap screws on the plate below the silicone heat pad.  they attach the linear bearings.  as long as everything is square in general your idea could work.  keep in mind you'll have to square everything up to the bed... which could change as you make adjustments... so it could be a much lengthier process than adjusting the bed to the build imperfections.

leveling the bed isn't that difficult.  just need a piece of card stock (business card) at the minimum or metal feeler gauge set.  a dial depth gauge would be most quantitatively accurate. then:
- heat up the nozzle and bed, home the head, adjust z-axis using the feeler / card / dial gauge.
- then just move the head to the three corners (in theory only two other orthogonal points, the third should line up if bed is flat) and adjust the corner screw to achieve the same nozzle height according to the feeler / dial gauge.  tip here, leave room for the allen wrench to reach the adjustment screw.
- check a few points in the middle, adjust or reevaluate the corners.
- print the calibration print.  check for adhesion and consistency of the filament bead (ie. oval shape means a good initial squash)
- if the print doesn't adhere well, or adheres too well, redo the above.  alternatively fine tune the z-axis through the g-code offset variable in your slicer software... as long as the bead of filament is consistent.

once the bed is level, it should be checked on every few weeks or if you move the machine."
several extruder questions...,"i;ve had my new taz 4 for a bit more then two months.
i went through a whole 2kg spool of lulzbot black abs.

i just received a new 5kg roll of lulzbot black abs....

i started a new print.... (cura says it will take 18 hours) some time about 6 hours in the hobbed bolt strips the 
the filament and it stops printing.....this was using the lulzbot fine abs setting with 100% fill.
these are the same settings as 95% of my prints.

so i have several questions...
i changed nothing in settings, height etc... just filament.
should i have changed something?if so what?

i've tried several times to restart and now it won't even print the first layer, what is the procedure for cleaning the hobbed bolt, do you do it in place or if not how do you remove it?","yep.  clean the hobbed bot with a brush... rotate theherringbone gear to get to other teeth.  make sure to cut the bad filament off where the hobbed bolt chewed through.  

heat up the hot end and manually feed the filament through the hotend.  support the extruder with one hand and press the filament through with idler open. if nothing then, the nozzle is probably clogged. 

some cold pulls may clear the clog.  heat up the filament to extrusion temp, then let hotend cool 20-30c.  open the idler, pull the filament put.  if done right, the result should be a conical imprint of the nozzle.  search the forums for cold pull... i've seen much better instructions with pictures.

need help with abs bridging / make bridging test,"help!  i can't bridge.  because i was having trouble bridging in other models, i thought i would try to print the make magazine bridging test (thingiverse link).  in the magazine, the taz 4 scored an impressive 5 out of 5 on this test.

my print looks like this:



... and from the side:



i can see the problem as it happens.  when the extruder goes to bridge, the filament doesn't stick to the source point.  so it just squirts spaghetti into thin air.  it does generally 'stick the landing', and after a few layers, it manages to print on top of the spaghetti pile.

any ideas would be greatly appreciated!

here are all the details...

i'm using slic3r 1.2.1 with fine_abs_no-support_pt35nzl_pt14layer-6s.ini configuration file, with the single modification of ""bridges fan speed: 100%"" (at the suggestion of ray in aleph support).

slic3r slices without complaints and produces this gcode file (dropbox link).

i'm using lulzbot abs black 3mm filament.  i start the hotend/bed at 235/85c.  the profile knocks it down to 220/80c after the first few layers.  i have good first-layer adhesion.","jebba wrote:it sounds more like a slic3r bug

i finally got cura working (details in the other thread i started).  i made a print from cura's gcode (standard abs fine profile).  the fan was on because of the minimum layer-time cooling-logic and warped the print.  turning the fan off hurt the bridging.  overall, cura's bridging result was better than slic3r.  comparing the two gcode files in a path visualizer, slic3r was moving non-optimally and retracting more often, notably just before a bridging attempt.  cura's code would make the bridge in one continuous feed with the perimeter of the layer.  i'm pretty inexperienced and i will have to look at retraction/ooze-control before i know how important that aspect of the tool path is in this case.

it would be nice if cura had a 'fan on for bridging' option.

pei for taz <5,"now that there is a taz 5, when do you expect to have available the pei surface for the rest of taz owners?     i expected to find it available along the hexagon head but it was not.   
btw, does the new taz5 have the psu integrated on the body?.","dustmason wrote:just wanted to chime in to say that i, too, have been using the 1/16"" pei from mcmaster-carr with good results. i haven't yet even stuck it down to the bed and still use 8 binder clips to hold it on. it is not as flat as it could be but i've had great success printing pla and abs on it. no failures at all. i will eventually use some adhesive to stick it down, so i'm also curious what kind you recommend.

having it clipped on is kind of convenient for removing parts that adhere too strongly. i just unclip it and gently bend the pei sheet and they pop right off.

that has been my problem, at least with abs.  i literally have to pry the pieces off the bed with considerable force proportional to the bed adhesion surface area.  the bigger the part's base is, the harder it is to get off.  i tried the painter putty knives from michaels as suggested from other forums, but there is no way of getting those under the part let alone applying sufficient force to get them to pop off without bending and ruining the putty knife.

i literally have a chunk missing near the center of my bed that a piece of abs pulled off.  is there something i am doing wrong?

by the same token, some stuff pops right off.  things like biofila silk and linen as well as flexpla come right off.   filaflex adheres like abs and is a bear to get loose.

is there something i can do to actually reduce abs adhesion?  boy, there is a question you thought you would never see eh?"

taz 5 fan wiring,"i received my taz 5 a couple weeks ago and am having an almost unreasonably good time with it.  that said, i have a lingering question that i haven't seen an answer to.  there are two fans associated with the hexagon hot end on the taz 5.  one is a small fan that points at the heat sink above the hot end, and one is a large fan that points just below the nozzle on the hot end.  the wires from the small fan are small, and the wires from the large fan are larger, however, the connectors into which you attach these wires are identical, and have identical wire sizes.  my question is, does it matter which connector you plug which fan into?  when i turn the taz 5 on, the little fan is always on, and the large fan speed is determined by settings of the firmware or the gcode that you are running.  is this correct, did i just get lucky in my wiring?  should i have control of the fan on the heat sink of the hexagon hot end?  just asking...

mark -","you're right, i was lucky.  i checked for dots on the  small fan connector and i had it  connected correctly.  one would think that if there were a chance of burning a fan up they would have mentioned the ""dot"" marking on the connectors in step 7.  however, what step 7 says is: ""connect the extruder assemblies' 4-pin connectors:  match the orange/red wire connector pair for the hot end and the mixed color wired connector pair for the extruder motor.  connect the matching pairs together so they lock and click"".  it says nothing about the fans, and nothing about dots.  if the small fan burns out when incorrectly attached, i'm surprised that doesn't happen more often.

small cylindrical parts printing oval,"hi,

taz 5 hotend clogged,"our week-old taz 5 has been printing parts in white abs (from lulzbot) without any trouble, but just yesterday it decided to stop extruding filament altogether, even in air. this seemed to indicate a clog, so we tried doing some cold pulls, which came out looking quite ghastly:






at no point did we see anything resembling the inside of the nozzle, and i'm not sure if those three little cavities are to be expected or not. based on the 3d diagram of the nozzle, i would say they're not. the hotend did, however, go from completely clogged to just partially clogged, as you can see from this picture:






rather than flowing freely as it did before, the extruded abs now forms curly lumps around the nozzle tip. i've already spoken to support about this and aside from doing more cold pulls, they had me try a print of the rocktopus, which came out looking like a hot mess:






we don't want to resort to soaking the nozzle in acetone, but are there any remaining options apart from having a replacement sent?

i'm also wondering what could have gone wrong to cause this in the first place. we've only used the green pla that came with the machine and then white abs ordered directly from lulzbot.","removing the nozzle is actually fairly easy... i don't think its supported by lulzbot though.  

if continuing with the cold pulls, make sure to try and extrude a bit of filament manually when the hotend is at temp... then cool down and do the pull.

there is also cleaner filament.

if you want to venture into removing the nozzle: 
- protect the pei and glass from the hot nozzle and tools.  i used a silicone pad / trivet
- remove filament - cold pull or at temp
- heat hotend to 165c keep this temp until nozzle removed.  
- use a 17mm or 18mm to prevent heater block from rotating, use a 7 or 8mm wrench to remove the nozzle.  i used the 18 and 8 combo since that's what i had on hand.
- unscrew the nozzle clockwise.  if unsure, righty tightly, lefty loosey'
- the nozzle will be hot, so make plans to ""catch"" or hold the nozzle.  i used large locking forceps or let the nozzle drop onto silicone pad if rated to 200c. a crescent wrench or vise-grips would work also.
- let the nozzle cool down
- optionally: remove as much filament from nozzle. i drilled out the filamemt with a low powered hobby drill an appropriate bit.  don't damage the interior of nozzle.
- soak in a jar of acetone.  if impatient, soak for 10-20 minutes and dig put softened abs with toothpick or suitable thin object (is drill bit, fork, bamboo skewer).
- shake every so often and use new acetone when it gets cloudy
- when acetone is clear after a soak, your nozzle should be clean
- use a strand of wire to thread through nozzle opening to ensure blockage is cleared.
- one final soak and shake in acetone.

replacing nozzle on heater block:
- protect your build plate as above
- make sure the nozzle is dry of acetone... if you have denatured alcohol that will help, but the acetone should evaporate on its own.
- heat hotend to 165c.
- hand thread (be careful, heater block will be hot) the nozzle to the heater block... must use fingertips so as not to damage the thread.  there should be very little resistance when screwing in the nozzle.  you'll only have 5-10sec before the nozzle gets too hot, just let it cool down for a minute and try again.
- once threaded, use the wrenches to tighten.  
- continue heating to 240c and re-tighten.
- let everything cool to 20-30c.
- heat back to 240c
- with idler open, push filament through by hand.
- should yield a nice straight extrusion.
- if not, repeat the cleaning.

as an added measure while the nozzle is off, heat hotend to 230.  use filament to push any leftover material in the heater block.

hope that helps!"
hexagon nozzle and volcano,"hi all, 

i just purchased a taz5 and am experimenting with materials and ways to reduce print times as part of a project on 3d printing prosthetic legs. two questions : first, has anyone tried larger alternatives to the stock .35 nozzle on the hexagon hot end? if so, is there a source? second, has anyone installed the e3d volcano on the taz5? i'd really like to see if i can speed up our printing process using larger layers. 

thanks, 

matt","could be... its a long thread, and somewhere in the last three pages, i think folks moved from the hexagon to e3d-v6 using the latest firmware (used for hex hotend).  i think all you need to do is print a j-plate... the hexagon aluminum plate is slightly too thin for the e3d from my limited experimentation.


in any case, i put the .5mm nozzle on the hexagon this evening beacuse my stock nozzle was clogged. prints were considerably faster.  my original layer height with the stock .35 was .2 with a extrusion width of .4.  with the .5 nozzle (from makerfarm) at layer height of .25 and width of .5.  the original print time was 3hrs cut down to 2hrs.  the detail wasn't bad... but for fine detailed projects, i'd probably go back tot he .35 nozzle.  

at $10, i'd give the .5mm nozzle a try before switching to the volcano."

why are these prints stoping at the same height every time?","i'm wondering if it has anything to do with the plug in (pause at height) i think it's called not at the computer now.  on my computer in cura this was set to 5mm just about then stoping point my prints are failing.  strange thing is all the prints i did we're quick prints and not in expert mode.   if you use the x icon in the upper right of the parameters box you can clear the current plug in that is being used for current print.  at least that's what it looks like to me.   so i'm wondering if these perimeters are being used for all the prints that have failed.   


anyone with input please let me know."
fan not spinning below 25%,my taz4 fan does not spin below 25% when set from the screen. is there a setting in the firmware i need to adjust when upgrading to the new all metal hot end? has anyone noticed this when updating. i dont reccall noticing this before the firmware was upgraded for the new hotend. i might have never noticed.,"wantmys2000 wrote:my factory taz 5 is just like this.  fan does not start spinning till about 27%.  this has been true on all of my printers.

z-axis stops stepping,"on what seems to be all larger prints (print time greater than an hour), both z-axis stepper motors stop incrementing.  my specs are:

taz4
pei bedplate
upgrade version2 toolhead (hex hotend)
pronterface

it seemed to have occurred after installing the version 2 toolhead along with the firmware upgrade.  i suspected it was the firmware upgrade so i rolled back to the 2014 q4 firmware (which i believe was still newer than the original firmware i had on the taz4 since i purchased it sept 2014) and reinstalled the budaschnozzle and old toolhead.  the same problem occurred.

the same print worked just fine prior to the firmware and toolhead upgrade.

after it stops incrementing and i pause the print, i am able to manually change the z-axis, so i do not believe it's mechanical.



 base 

the z-axis does not move at this level, so it extrudes and rubs against the top-most layer","i used a kittaz rambo board.enclosure on my hardware and it seems to have worked fine.

i'm starting to think the .hex file that i used (and flashed with firmware) was the issue.  the kittaz was running marlin 2014q3 revb which was the same version i was attempting to revert back to with the hex file but was flashed directly from arduino ide.  the 2015q1 version was also a .hex file and also had the same problem.

i will try flashing tonight directly with arduino ide."
how to removed printed objects,"i'm a noob... i have a taz4 and am printing abs (and using cura if that matters).  when in print i'm setting the nozel to 230 and the bed to 85.  i also have been printing with a layer of lulzjuice.  two questions...

first, after the piece has been printed, should i remove the object while the bed is hot, or should i wait for the bed to cool down?

second, so far i've been removing the objects with the bed still hot/warm.  last night i tried out waiting for the bed to cool, and well... the object seems pretty darn fused to the print bed.  i think i'm going to try heating the bed and then try prying the object off.

any suggestions on how the best way to remove prints?

thanks,

jeff","it's a stock taz4, so i'm printing onto the pet sheet.  i'm also applying a liberal amount of lulzjuice.  odd timing... this morning i was thinking that i should try reducing the amount of lulzjuice i use.  i started using lulzjuice b/c the second print i tried to make ended up detaching from the plate half way through the printing.  i tried a second time and it too detached (i wasn't printing with a brim), so i started to use lulzjuice with my prints.

i think i'll try 1) using acetone to remove most of the leftover lulzjuice off the plate, 2) try printing with just a very light amount of abs and lulzjuice and experiment a bit.

i haven't decided to make the switch yet, but i've been reading through the forum, trying to pick up tips, and it looks like a lot of people are having great results with removing the pet film and applying a sheet of pei.  i haven't decided to do this yet (i'm still getting my feet wet) but it looks promising.

before reading the posts in this forum about pei, i was thinking about buying a printinz flex plate from adafruit, but they are pricey ($110), so between pei and a printinz flex plate, i'm going to try pei first.

oh, also, as i originally mentioned, i had a printed piece which seemed to be stuck to the print bed.  i ended up taking the clam knife, dipping the blade in pure acetone (no abs), and using the edge of the bade to trace the edges of the object on the heat plate.  i then (gently) used the clam knife to slowly wedge itself between the print and the plate, and then slowly twisted the knife (trying to not chip away at the print, and not damage the pet tape either), and i eventually pried the piece off.

filament stuck; oozing out slowly,"we just assembled our taz 5 yesterday and went through all the calibration/test print stuff, and our octopus was printing nicely. when it was almost complete, however, the extruder head was still moving, but no filament (abs) was being extruded. i stopped the print and found that the filament was stuck and that the steel/aluminum gear that feeds the filament to the extruder head was grinding the filament (looks like it has a bite taken out of it) instead of feeding it. 

  i have tried to the remove the filament but it is stuck fast. i have tried removing it while extruding and reversing, but to no avail. the extruder head still slowly oozes filament out when it is heated up (240deg), however, so i am not sure how to unclog/see what is causing the stuck filament.

any help would be greatly appreciated in this discouraging time!","you'll need to remove the filament to get past that notch created by the hobbed gear.  heat the hotend to 240, then open the idler completely and pull the filament out... the notched area on the filament is probably weak so be gentle when pulling.  if it breaks, get a pair of forceps or something better than the tweezers to grip the leftover filament.

check the spool and make sure the filament comes off fairly easily.  i've had spools where filaments ""stick"" together or bind.  lesson learned, i unroll a bit before each print or after i remove the last print...  its a bit tricky with a brand new spool since there's a tendency for the filament to come out of the spool and wrap around the holder."

instead of using 3m tape for pei,"what do you think of permatex #85915

this is a spray adhesive good to 600°f.

i figure put a super-super light coat of this spray adhesive on the glass and apply the pei. seems alot easier than dealing with tape. it's slow drying, but hey it's 3d printing. everything in our world is measured in hours anyway lol.

thoughts?","mhackney wrote:tried it, it does not work. believe me - the 3m tape is the best and most cost effective and easiest to apply solution. why buck the system?

the issue with this spray adhesive is although rated to 600°, it becomes gooey at much lower temperature and the pei will peal. it is intended as a gasket adhesive where the gasket is compressed between two metal surfaces, preventing the gasket from moving.

ok too bad. i hate tape."
z-hop settings taz5,what height is everyone using for z-hop? i am getting a lot of nozzle drag when moving across the part. i had a print last night fail because the nozzle dragged and pulled some of the first layer up with it.,"also check that you're not over-extruding... spot measure the filament diameter, or dial down the flow multiplier.  

an easy way to recover during a print is to use the dial on the lcd panel... the knob seems defaults to fr on my taz5, turning will increase and decrease flow percentage.

if you have a fragile print... lots of columns, then enable nozzle retract (in addition to filament retract) on move in the slicer program."

today i started a print, watched to make sure it got the brim down. then went to have a smoke, when i came back to check on it i saw that it was no longer extruding. killed the power right away. restarted and heated it back up to see if the hobbled bolt had taken a bite out of it. it was hard to see and then i saw a ton of little plastic shavings.  tried to pull the filament out and could not. turned it back off and visited the forum to see if i could find an answer. found a post where it seemed to have my answer that i needed. (viewtopic.php?f=36&t=1772&p=10004&hilit=clogged#p10004). in there orias listed a step by step way to fix the issue. i'll rehash as short as i can.
1. heated the hotend using pronterface to 250c, then waited a while for it the heat up then a extra min or two.
2. popped open the idler holder.
3. tried to tug the filament out. no luck, so i let it set for a couple more min to see if it would soften up so i could tug it out. once again i gave it a tug and it broke off from the hotend. 
4. went back to the forum to see if i could find help, nothing really that i could tell. 
5. called a buddy that had a jeweler's lathe thing, and asked for some help cuz he had very fine bits. worked with him for a couple hours to trim out filament that we could see before putting the whole thing back together.
6. heated the end up and fed some filament in, boom had feed, crappy but feed. then i noticed that the small fan was not working. thinking that i may have got the wires wrong i shut it off and pulled my book. (which by the way as a side note, it don't really show a way to tell the 2 fan plugs apart. update maybe.) since it was not working i unplugged the 2 and switched them. still got nothing, again i turned it off and checked my wiring and inside the plugs to see if when i took it apart, if something worked loose. didn't find anything so i restarted it. nope nothing.
after troubleshooting by unpluging the small fan and plugging it into the large fan which is working, it still does not work. 

so where do i go from here, do i have to pay for a whole new head or is it covered. it really seems that the wiring is not putting out power to turn it on at all.","its np. mistakes happen, really happy to have great feedback. and ill check that link out, what i had in mind was a (printer head insert?) or mod that uses 3 fans. left, right and front that weights the same but gives you greater control over how much air is used where. a buddy had an idea to use a hose like thing with a flat nozzle to direct the air so less is hitting the bed.

taz5 hexagon hotend fan,"just setup my taz5 and plugged in the hotend, extruder and power cables for the two fans (one squirrel cage fan on the hotend fins, and the bigger fan for the filament extrusion).  found that the two power cables for the fans can be swapped and at first i had them swapped (there was no mention in the manual about identifying what plug matches the other)  and found the larger fan would barely spin, switched the two cables and it now spins correctly and i can set it from the lcd and it will speed up as it should.  

my question is the  fan for the hexagon hotend fins still never spins up, is this automatic or is there some setting i'm missing to make it work?   

i read elsewhere you don't want to run it without the fan cooling it via the fins or it will burn out faster.

also, i'm finding that mid prints the hotend clogs and chew the filament, could this be related to the hotend not cooling?  

thanks in advance.","well i've contacted support, we'll see what they can suggest.  just to update though, i've tested the small hotend fan with a voltmeter, read a 4.95v on the meter, when the unit is up to temp.  found that at ambient temps i had no reading...so there must be some kind of temp sensor or a bad power supply (more on that in a sec).  i tested the fan by plugging into a 12v battery and it still will not power on, checked the shroud around it and it moves freely.  i tried to remove the fan but found that the retaining screw wobbles like it's bent and it will not unscrew...so that's not an easy fix...if lulzbot just sends me a fan.   i did wire a temporary fan up to the hotend fins and finally completed my first print, i also loosened the filament idler and that seems to have helped with the extrusion stopping mid print.  but, that's not my biggest problem now.  after the second attempt on the octopus the unit shut off and restarted, i checked the power plug and it was secure, i cancelled the print and restarted and after the bed and hotend were up to temp i heard a popping / arcing sound coming from the power supply box...it then shut down again and restarted itself, after it reached operating temp again the popping and arcing buzzing from the power supply got worse...it's now unplugged and making it's way back into the box...sigh."
taz4 misfeeding - hobbed bolt chewing filament,"i've been experiencing a mis feed on the taz4 every month or so where the filament stops extruding after several layers have been placed.  the first few layers always print fine, then it either stops or extrudes intermittently.

i had just gotten done printing with a clear abs filament then switched to black abs filament which i use plenty of.

this is the first attempt.  you can see that some of the strands are missing:



 first attempt. 


the hobbed bolt had chewed threw the filament so it was no longer even extruding intermittently.  next, i cleaned the hobbed bolt and attempted again:



 second attempt. 


the extrusion definitely occurs with fits and starts.  i stopped the print before it stopped extruding entirely.  i think this last image is the most important, as you can see clearly how it fed the clear filament (left) vs the failed black filament (right):



 filament comparison. 


it seems to get stuck every so often the catch, then get stuck again.  we recently built an enclosure but i know the filament travel path is pretty low resistance.  the ambient temp at the time of failure is 90f, with a bed plate temp of 95c, a first layer nozzle temperature of 230c which changes to 220c after the second layer begins.","hi!  this actually sounds exactly like the problem i just worked through.  i ended up breaking it down in to two factors: too much tension on the idler bolts, and too much resistance to filament movement through the extruder.

it seems like everyone just tells you to make the idler bolts as tight as possible but what i found was that making them super tight just made it more likely that my hobbed bolt was going to eat the filament.  so instead i left the idler bolts loose and then sent a long slow extrusion command to the printer so i could slowly tighten the bolts to just the point where everything seemed to be grabbing with no slipping.

second, i had some issues with resistance in my extruder.  i had recently had a pla jam in the ptfe tube so i had to clean that up.  if you need more details on that search my posts and read that thread.  however i think the bigger factor was that for some of my pla filaments 180 degrees was not hot enough to get a good flow.  i was able to get good results with my blue filament, but not with my black or orange at 180 degrees.  after turning the temp up to 185, i was able to get good results with my black.  i have not tried the orange yet, but i suspect its the same problem.

try bumping your temps up a few degrees to see if that does the trick.  every filament is slightly different!"
taz 5 left side fan duct,"i have a design that i print up quite often for the special needs community (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:148045) that has tons of overhangs on all sides.  on my previous printer i had to wire up a good deal of additional cooling for the pla to not curl.  on the taz 5 the prints came out great on one side, but curled on the other.  i tried to retrofit some of the taz fan ducts i found out in the forums, but they were all designed for the older hotend, not the hexagon, so they did not fit.  i drew up a quick duct that tried to match the look and feel of the factory duct and put it up on thingiverse (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:716002).  it is thin enough that it does not not reduce the travel at all and requires no modification to the taz to mount.

it has fixed my overhang issues perfectly.  hope it helps anyone else who was having the curling issues.

steven","thanks for the link!  i have a left side fan already hooked up to my kittaz, but i had to hook it up to the 2nd extruder fan slot on my rambo. if i ever add a 2nd extruder, or if i upgrade to the new all metal hot end, the one i have will need to be rewired.  just soldering too leads is easy enough.  

thanks for the link, and thanks for the taz5 left side fan duct file."
instructions for dual extruder into taz 5?,"i guess they are similar to taz 4, except i don't see a dual extruder firmware available for taz 5 anywhere. also there are no arduino files located in the taz 5 sub. i am afraid to do any updating until i am sure those are the correct files. also are there fans available that mount on the dual extruder for pla?","taz 5 = taz 4 + hexagon extruder + pei print surface

if you want to use the dual extruder with a taz 5, you will be able to use the firmware provided with the dually.  just make sure you change the firmware back if/when you switch back to the hexagon extruder."
warped print bed,"hiya!

i've had my taz 4 for a few months, and i'm generally happy with it.

however, i noticed recently that my print bed isn't flat. i can level it just fine at the corners, and verify that it's level, but i'll have portions of the bed higher than the corners. is this normal?

i'd really like to print using the whole print bed, but i don't feel confident doing that when the center of the bed is significantly higher than the corners (nozzle crashes in center while corners are a little on the low side).

is this a faulty glass plate? is there something i can do about this?","it would be very, very strange to have the glass not perfectly flat, that is one reason glass (borosilicate float glass) is used.

if you are absolutely sure it's not flat then contact support for a replacement. if you have a steel ruler, you can use the edge to verify if it's flat, just lay the edge across the glass at different angles and see if there is a gap anywhere between the edge and the glass.


also check out the proper bed leveling video by lulzbot on youtube just in case you missed a step."
replacment printed parts for the taz 5,"hi,

i searched the forums but the terms are too common and couldn't find any results. where can i download stl files for printing taz 5 parts? specifically i just purchased a flexi-dually print head and noticed that the back most printed plate is cracked where one of the nut inserts are placed (in one of the ""arms"" that extend outward on each side).

i suppose i could return the entire assembly and ask for a replacement, but i thought it would be cheaper and easier just to reprint the part, and scavenge the hardware from the original.","

i've sliced and printed a few of the stls (from download.lulzbot.com) and they seem fine with no additional scaling.  if i were looking for an exact replica, i'd probably go with the gcode files.  if you watch the print its possible to use the flow rate on the lcd panel to compensate for the different nozzle openings.  i would guess that a .5 nozzle requires less filament than the .35 nozzle... therefore a flow rate of 105-110% could compensate.  if the nozzle begins to hit the edge of the print after a few layers, reduce the flow rate.

honestly, i'd probably try the gcode ""as is"" and compare the outcome... pick a small part as the test.  bearing holder comes to mind."
questions about replacement nozzles,"when my nozzle was jammed with hips about a week ago and it didn't seem like i was going to get it unclogged, i ordered some new nozzles. i did a google search for .35mm hexagon hotend and what came up was the maker farm site. but all they had was .4 mm and .3 mm nozzles for 3 mm filament. i ordered them anyway in the .3 mm size. i ended up getting my nozzle cleaned out and got the printer printing again. the  maker farm nozzles came in the mail today and i figured they could just serve as backups if i get another jam and need to soak my nozzle. my questions are, are the .3 mm nozzles a direct replacement for the .35 mm or would i have to recalibrate my extruder if i used one? would i see much of a difference in print quality if i use the .3 mm nozzles? is there any advantage or disadvantage to using a smaller nozzle than stock?  these nozzles look exactly like the one that came with my taz 5 and that's part of the confusion. they even have the same 3 engraved on the side. thanks in advance for any info.","i've observed a lot of confusion/misunderstanding on extrusion calibration here. i'll answer your nozzle question in a minute but let me set the record straight re extruder calibration.

extruder calibration has nothing to do with the hotend or nozzle. extruder calibration is simply determining the number of steps required to push 1mm of raw filament throught the extruder. it does depend on how many steps per revolution the stepper uses (all 1.8* steppers are 200 steps per revolution), any gearing down in the drive train, and the effective diameter of the cobbed bolt/gear. remember, it is the steps per mm to move the incoming raw filament, not the amount that comes out of the nozzle. i think this confuses a lot of people. once you've calibrated your extruder, you can swap hot ends, nozzles, without recalibrating. in fact, you can even move the extruder to a completely different printer and it will not need to be recalibrated. there is a very minor effect due to filament diameter but even the difference between 1.75mm and 3mm filament is negligible.

now, on to your question...

you certainly can use a .3mm nozzle. you don't need to recalibrate your extruder but you do need to change some slicing configurations. these differ from slicer to slicer but they are all similar and something like ""extrusion width"". set that to .3mm. you will likely need to change your layer height too. a good rule of thumb is layer height is between 50% and 75% of nozzle diameter. 

a .3mm nozzle will give a bit better print quality if you change the layer height but at the expense of longer times to print. even if you don't change the layer height print time will increase with some improvement in bottom and top surface quality."
min/max temp error,"hi there!

problem:
i get the error min temp, and when i then switch off and on again (after 15 sec) i get the error max temp.

so.. background..

i just set my new taz 4 up on thursday, so i'm very much the noob at this, but committed to getting to pro.. 

i'm afraid i might have broken something but i'm not sure how to find out, soi i'd appreciate some help..

i got a clogged nozzle and a lot of oozing along the threads, out over the heater element (read up on it) and after trying to remove as much as possible by ""fishing"" with a strip of metal wiring i ended up realising that i'd have to remove the nozzle. 

i didn't realise i had to turn the machine off for removing the nozzle, since i used the display to make sure i was at the recommended 160 degrees, which might have been my big mistake (read in another thread that this was a good way to short the circuit board).

my heater element was really loose, which led to it moving a lot when i removed the nozzle (wiggling say +- 15 degrees). after i cleaned the nozzle out and replaced it, tightening the element's three screws at the same time, as soon as i turn the heater on, i get the error min temp, and when i then switch off for 15 sec and on again the max temp error shows up and the extruder switches off..

how do i run a diagnostics on this to find the problem?

i've checked the wiring, and it's not broken anywhere that i can see.. the green inset (heater element?) is loose though, so i can actually move it back and forth a little bit..

any help appreciated!","here's the readouts from printer interface when i started it up..

what parts do i need to print to convert a flexi-dualie head to a standard dual head?  i assume i need the extruder and maybe one of the dualie plates.  but i can't find any extruder parts in the dualie folder.","i didn't see it.

there are 2 files but they do not allow download via ftp.

maybe a link in these folders to the appropriate sub-assemblies would be in order?

so i should get the extruder from the taz4?  ironwood?

i assume the currently shipping flexi-dualie is the budda hot end not the hex like i got with the taz5.

there is no difference in the base extruder (ships with taz) and the one on the dual head?  other than the thin steppers that is, i meant as far as the printed parts go.

taz 5 won't power on,"i just received my taz 5 two days ago, and it has already stopped working. i'm guessing it's the power supply, but it really disappoints me that i've only had this printer for two days and it's already showing faults. i'm new to lulzbot printers. are faulty power supplies a common thing?","this seems to be a pretty big problem. i am currently dead in the water with a bad power supply as well. i made it four days before mine died. glancing through the forum i see about 4 or 5 other threads with people having the same problem. i am wondering if it has something to do with the new hotend. perhaps it is drawing more amperage then the power supply can realistically provide and is burning them up. i hope this get addressed soon.

also i sent an email on saturday morning and have not heard anything back as well."
hybrid hotend,"hi to all, i found on kickstarter this project  and i'm interested in their hotend. i contacted them through email to ask them if it's compatible with taz4 but they answered that  the new lulzbots use the hexagon hot end, which has a standard 16mm groove mount like the hybrid. can some please tell me if it's compatible or not?","i had better luck mounting my e3d v6 using these parts. the e3d and hexagon hotends are shorter that the buda. the new extruder mount lowers everything a bit and the other parts let it all clamp together tightly while keeping the z min end stop in range.

use second nozzle heater to control chamber heating,"so i created enclosure for my taz4. it made abs prints a little bit better, but still not perfect. it still curls. i measured about 90f inside chamber when using 80c for heated bed. going higher with heated bed makes prints worse.

so i went ahead and bought 250w infrared lamp in lowes. curling went away completely! but i got other issues - it was clearly heating it too much and not quite even. so next what i want to try - 150w lamp and control it via second nozzle heater. i already found solid state relay, which can be triggered by 24v to control infrared lamp, but i was wondering what i need to do to be able to change second hotend temperature independently from bed temperature (right now both seems to be coupled)

any clues?","yeah, already ordered thermistors to measure ambient temperature (or maybe i should measure frame temperature - going to experiment.) just noticed that in my taz4 hotend2 temperature is always set to what bed set at, so it is clearly something needs to be tweaked when i install second thermistor.

you mentioned lulzbot dual extruder firmware, do you know by any chance url/something where i can get one? i want to compare two to see differences."
new  taz 5 owner 3 weeks in,"ok, it's been about 3 weeks roughly since i got my taz5 in the mail. i ordered this printer mainly due to build volume and cost. i originally wanted an ultimaker 2, simply because this was my first foray into 3d printing and my first printer, i wanted the printer to be as user friendly and easy to use as possible. the ultimaker 2 seemed to fit the bill. but when i saw the capabilities of the taz i figured it might be a better fit for some of the things that i eventually wanted to build. such as quadcopters, full size cosplay mask, and motorcycle parts. the reviews that i read said that if you were a tinkerer and didn't mind adjusting some things, that you could get excellent quality builds out of the taz. well, i am an electrician by trade, i have built several computers, and i do all of my own work on my cars so i figured i was good. boy was i wrong, lol.

the taz has a learning curve to it, as well as 3d printing has a learning curve. i was one of the dummies that thought i could print the calibration print and then jump into printing full size, technical prints with a lot of details. nevermind reading the manual and actually figuring out how to do things properly. needless to say i ran into a lot of problems. well, after getting my nozzle clogged with hips filament, i decided to slow down and read the manual while my nozzle was soaking in acetone. i have since learned a lot about the printer and it's settings as well as the settings in cura. i now have a little process that has helped me improve my prints a lot. i'll do a small list of the things that have helped me in hopes that they may help some other noobs.

1. read the entire manual. pay close attention to the parts that deal with whatever slicer you will be using.
2. read mhackney's guides. there is tons of helpful info in there for noobs.
3. once you move from the quickprint settings to the full settings (i'm talking cura as this is what i use and works best 
    for me) be mindful of any changes you make. they all affect your print in different ways.
4. slow your print speeds down. i know it takes longer but this usually gives the best quality prints.
5. keep your bed and your nozzle pristine clean after every print. trust me on this one, prints can fail if the nozzle is 
    obstructed or dirty . also the clean bed helps with adhesion of prints. i use isopropyl alcohol.
6. this is just personal preference, but i found that if i prime the extruder and manually extrude several mm's of   
    filament before i start a print, i get much better results and less failed prints.

a few other things i will mention. i downloaded several stl's and gcode files off of the internet. you have to be careful when downloading gcode as some of it may have changes to your settings that aren't especially good for your printer. i found out that my retraction settings had been changed. this was causing too much filament to retract during printing and i think this is what caused my clogged nozzle. i was also having issues with prints not sticking well to the bed on the side where the fan is. i checked the settings and my fan was set to blow at 100% after a layer height of .5 mm. i changed this to 50% and now i have no problem with prints sticking to the bed. the last thing i will add is i know that since the release of the new all metal hotend, the suggestions are to raise the printing temps by 10 degrees celsius. i was using 240 degrees for hips and found that i was getting a lot of rough looking top layers. i adjusted the temp down to 230 and my top layers have gotten a lot smoother. just a small note ymmv of course.

sorry for the long post. i just want to say that the taz 5 is a great printer and maybe not the best fit for someone who is completely new to 3d printing. i was very close to giving up on this thing. but, if you are willing to learn the machine and the ins and outs of 3d printing, this thing can produce some absolutely beautiful items.

thank you to mhackney and all of the other helpful people on this forum for your help and suggestions. believe me it is really appreciated.","thanks baltimorebilly. i've been through a lot of ""misprints"" myself so i know how frustrating it can be! all consumer level printers require finessing and some level of understanding. i understand the excitement to rush ahead and print complex items as soon as possible but even a little (hour or two) of ""practice"" up front will save hours/days of frustration later - that's why i wrote the guides.

taz 5 hips nozzle to close?,i have been printing with pla for a while and have gotten comfortable with it.  i just moved to hips (esun) and i think the first layer looks different.  almost as if the nozzle is plowing through and making a trough.  but i need some opinions on how it is suppose to look.  is the z height too close to build plate? any help would be appreciated!,"one thing to check is your initial layer height.  when going from pla to hips you are heating your bed up 50c hotter which causes more expansion of the bed materials.  if you don't readjust your initial layer height, the first layer will be too close and smash the hips into the bed causing a nasty looking first layer.

so first thing is to double check that adjustment.  second thing is to change to abs.  i purchased a few rolls of hips with my taz because it seemed to be recommended.  i basically hate the stuff and see no advantage over abs other then price.  it prints significantly worse then abs in my opinion.

thanks!

fine tuning help needed since hex hotend,"ok so i am trying to get as good quality prints as i can. i have gotten down to a point where i need a bit of help.

now i started off using the taz medium config from lulzbot in slic3r. i am now down to two issues (maybe same cause).

i am having ghosting or shadowing around holes and other features. from what i read it's due to acceleration and while i know where the acceleration setting is on the machine i thought i would get some feedback on what it should be.

the second issue is a bit of wavyness starting at corners, i suppose this could also be acceleration but i thought i would ask.

now, i am not printing super fast or anything but the parts i am making over and over take some time so i would prefer to solve it without just slowing it all down. perimeters is set to 100 (again the default from lulzbot) 

i see acceleration is 500
vxy jerk is 8
vz jerk is 0.4
ve jerk is 10

i am assuming that accel is the one i need to change, but up or down and small or medium amounts (i.e. will a change of 1-5 help or is it going to be more like 20-50 ??)

thanks","i have noticed that the igus bearings on the x carriage that ship with the taz have a very loose fit.  this loose fit has caused the issues you are indicating here on my machine.  i recently upgraded it to use hardened rods with 10mm linear bearings from misumi and it has solved my issues.  i am also able to run a much higher accelerations and maintain good print quality.

there are threads in this forum that document this upgrade in detail (viewtopic.php?f=36&t=88&start=40).  without this upgrade i think you are going to have to not just reduce acceleration but print speed as well.

thanks!

taz5 lead screw nut,"where can i find the part number for the taz5 z-axis lead screw nut?

hexagon hotend requires much higher temperature for pla?,i got a hexagon hotend replacing my budaschnozzle hotend from lulzbot but it seems like if i am using the temperature setting when i was using budaschnozzle on this new hotend it will severely under-extrude and eventually clog. i used to use 200 degrees for lulzbot esun pla and now i need 250(230 is still underextruding) in order to extrude properly. did i get a faulty unit or its the property of this hotend? i havent try other materials yet.,"ryankivi, if your extruder was calibrated properly and working properly before with the same filament and then started ""short extruding"" by this large amount out of the blue, there are several causes and they are all mechanical. i would have checked them in this order:

build up of filament dust/particulates on the cog in the extruder. this is easy to check/see by removing the filament and looking at the cog to see if the teeth are filled with plastic. if so, you should remove the head assembly and use tooth picks or a fine wire to clean each and every groove. it only takes a few minutes. this is by far the #1 reason for what you observed.
clamping pressure as per the support suggestion. the reason this might work as a first step is that it is overcoming the filled in teeth on the cog, but it is a bandaid if #1 is the root cause. sometimes when you change filaments the spring tensioner does not position quite right or maybe the screws got loosened up a bit - especially if you loosen them during the filament change.
a loose set screw on the cog or gear, allowing one of these to slip. the set screws on the cog do require periodic checking and tightening. the first time i do it, i add a little locktite and never have the problem again. if i had a dollar for every person i've helped diagnose a loose set screw with, i'd have $132.00!
some form of restriction in the filament path - hanging up on the spool arm, a kink in the filament binding somewhere etc. this usually appears as an erratic issue and not a consistent issue.

what i want for xmas is...auto bed leveling (kittaz),"hi,
i am new to 3d printing but have recently assembled a kittaz and have two successful printouts under my belt.
i have already learned that bed leveling is the bane of 3d printing and that the taz 4 is no exception.

i have seen videos that boast inductive sensors to leverage a marlin firmware feature but requires the print bed be metal and not glass.  i am looking for a technique that uses endstop switches.  this is a feature that i desperately want to implement but will not undertake without guidance.  guidance from the company i bought the printer from would be ideal but at this point i will settle for less.

i know there is a link somewhere on the lulzbot website that talks about auto bed leveling but am unable to find it. curiously the search feature on the main website fails me.  any feedback is most appreciated.

many thanks","i came from a printer with auto-level.  and while it is convenient, there is tuning associated.  


working with the taz5 the last few weeks and i can say there is a slight learning curve, but its easy to overcome.  here's what i've found:
- get a dial gauge and print one of the holders.  this quantitatively evaluates the levelness of your bed with respect to the extruder mount or rods.  it nice to know you're .15 off and as you adjust see it go to .000.
- the business card is good, but a set of feeler gauges would probably be more accurate to adjust z-stop.
- z-offset g-code setting has been really good to me.  i was used to adjust m212 for an off-set of the probe.  setting a z-offset through the slicer software is very precise... of course, it doesn't negate setting the z-stop properly.

to be honest, the pei is really good with adhesion of abs.  once you've got a decent first layer squash, its almost foolproof.  i've gone a week so far without having to touch the bed..."
brand new taz 5 user,"hi guys, i've been printing for a few years with a r2 and was looking for more build volume (and ultimately two extruders) so i just purchased a taz 5.

i've got it set up and printing. couple of issues

the tension setting on the extruder is giving me fits. it seems to be printing ok, but in pronterface it would extrude fine for a few seconds and then slow down. drove me crazy. it did it when it was too tight and jammed, and too loose and printed slowly, and all points inbetween. i guess i've got the tension right since it's successfully printing now, but is there a more concrete way to know i have the right tension?

bed leveling is just brutal. i spent over 2 hours on it. edit: have it nailed now. perfect.","jebba wrote:billyd wrote:i forgot to mention that my sd card was blank. no biggie i can download the files.

can you send your serial number to moe@alephobjects.com and mention the sd card was blank?

the general rule is if the motors are too hot to the touch, they are too hot. i don't know the temp, offhand. when they get too hot, they start skipping steps. you likely won't damage the motors running hot, but the print will fail.

replacing taz4 glass bed,"the glass bed of my taz4 recently splintered very dramatically while removing a print. is there a trick to removing the silicone heat pad? it is secured to the glass pretty well, and worried about having to replace the pad too.","i asked about this when i first got my taz (i have not cracked the glass yet) and was told the official answer is to replace it all. but, if you want to try, get some orange oil (sold as de-solv-it, goo gone and others) and try to get it to the adhesive, the orange oil is absolutely fantastic and dissolving glue and won't hurt the silicone. it may take some time as it has to touch the glue to work so you might have to spray is on exposed areas, wait, peel it back, spray some more and so on.

but then you need to get a proper adhesive sheet to glue it onto new glass. like this http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/e ... nd/2649265"
initial taz 5 frustrations,"hello all,

ok, i got my taz 5 today and everything was great; i put it all together and loaded pronterface, leveled the bed and wanted to run some calibrations. 
but i tried to extrude 5mm @ 100mm/s to clear the white material that lulzbot used to run the test piece, but i keep getting a little squirt and then the hobbed bolt does the half moon thing!

extruder temp is 185 material is pla.
so i pull the pla, trim and repeat. i've tried several (5?) times, same result.

any thoughts?","mhackney wrote:jebba, does lulzbot print the test parts with abs? if so, if muggs was trying to clean that out with pla at pla melt temperature, it will not be hot enough to melt the abs so it is, in effect, plugged. if this is the case, it should become part of the user guide.

yes, this is a good point, i thought we had considered it. the taz has traditionally shipped with an abs octopus. the mini ships with a yellow hips octopus. i don't know if we switched that for the taz 5. but either way, it is abs or hips, which is higher than pla. i thought our guide accounted for that, but perhaps not.

you basically need to purge at the temp of the higher temp material.

improved taz fan duct,"ever since we deployed our taz 3 we've had issues with heat creep with pla on certain builds. basically the heat creeps up the 3mm filament and softens it inside the section of the budaschnozzle where the ptfe tube runs through the heat sinks. as the hobbed bolt applies downward pressure on the filament, it expands inside the ptfe tube and gets stuck, and stops extruding. then the hobbed bolt does its familiar half moon chunk carved into the filament and the build is failed.

when ao came out with fan kits for the taz, we were really happy, but the duct only blows onto the build. this improves build quality and bridge capability, but fails to address the heat creep issue. we set about redesigning the duct so that it splits the airflow to both the build and to the fins of the budaschnozzle.

here's the link to the design files on thingiverse:

http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:374906

now that we've gotten over 30 or so hours of build time with pla with zero extrusion issues, we'd like to share this with the rest of the taz community.","ok, since i installed this new duct, i've done a 14-hour print and a 37-hour print in pla. they were both successful on the first try, and they came out very good. before this i couldn't get more than about 2 hours into a pla print with these filaments before the extruder would jam. 

these two prints used about the same amount of filament and used similar slicing profiles. the difference is that the 37-hour print is very intricate with a lot of multi-sided internal perimeters with short sides, so the feed rate was very slow. in my experience, the slow feed rate would have made it even more susceptible to jamming from pla heat creep, so i'm sold on the new fan shroud/duct that cools the budaschnozzle fins.

for the 14-hour print, i ran the fan at 35%, and for the 37-hour print i ran it at 55%."
z-ribbing/waviness on taz 4,"





any thoughts on what is causing it and how to fix it?","that's definitely something out of alignment / bent / misconfigured. for starters, is this an upgrade from a 3.2 to a 4, or a stock factory 4? i'm going to assume it's a stock one for the moment, and that you have the default factory configuration and firmware and are using a default lulzbot printing profile. 

on a taz 4, the rods and leadscrews are constrained at both ends, so they can't ""flex"" to accommodate missallignment. in your case, the issue goes all the way up, so it's not likely that it is the endpoints of the z axis assembly itself. without a picture of the printer to take a look at, i'm guessing you have something loose at the z to x axis mounting points that is allowing the x axis to shift more than it should.

with a good set of calipers, levels and gauges, work from the bottom of your printer up to the top and verify that everything is in alignment, all the bolts are tight, the leadscrews are lubricated, the leadscrew to motor couplers are tight and locked down, etc. make sure the distance between the leadscrews themselves at the top and the bottom of the assembly is identical, and the distance from each leadscrew to each bearing rod is correct. you may want to pay special attention to the leadscrew interface to the x axis, ensure that all the bolts there are correct. it doesn't take being off very far to show up as a fairly major issue. you also might try swapping out the bearings if this machine has seen a lot of use. 

whats odd in this case is that it looks like every other layer is too narrow across the board front and back. z wobble usally shows up as an every other layer slight offset in one direction. yours looks like each other layer is just smaller than it should be. maybe underextrusion? maybe printing in a layer height that isn't a multiple of the leadscrew height? 

 a high resolution picture of the machine itself might be helpful if you can upload one."
zoinks!  can you mix hex and budda on dual head?,"i just realized i really got 3 heads already.  i got the taz5 and came with a hex and extuder.  just bought a flexi-dualie.  is there any reason i cant take the hex+extruder off the single plate, take the flexi+budda off the dualie, and put the hex+extuder on the dualie givin me a head that prints dual abs (or abs+pva)?

is it legit to use one budda and one hex at the same time?  any drawbacks or considerations?  shold the hex be #1 or doesn't it matter?","i was wondering the same thing... 

turns out the hex may stick out a little further from the aluminum plate (something like 4mm).  which would require the adapter plate or modifying the extruder.  

on top of that i think you need different firmware for the thermistor...  if the firmware just takes into account a temp difference, maybe its just a matter of adding the +/- offset.  


i'm curious to hear what you figure out."

thank you.","have you tried printing the sample files on the sd card?  if the factory supplied gcode files print, then it could be some setting in the slicer.

taz 5 with mini upgrades?,"hello all,

i have a taz 5 coming, soon i hope!
any reason i couldn't print the mini type corners, make 4 thick metal washers and print the wiper and tweak the firmware to bed level and wipe the tip like the mini?

also what are the typical first few upgrades to the taz that most people go through?","the bed of my taz5 is lower in the middle than the corners.  the corners barely allow a business to slide between bed and nozzle... the middle is noticeably easier to pass the same business card.  i just got a dial gauge to better document this.

an autoprobe only determines the plane of the bed.  then the firmware assumes the bed is flat.  therefore this type of warping / sag won't be resolved with the autoprobe and three point sampling.  adding a few more sample points near the center of the bed may help ""average"" out the plane to compensate for the sag in the middle of the bed, but the bottom of a very large part would be slightly uneven.  a raft could help, but my large prints often warp with a raft.

i've read that pei has a natural curve when warmed depending on the thickness of the material.  the taz5 pei looks pretty thin, but as does the underlying glass... so this shouldn't be a factor.  i've gotten to a point where the abs adhesion is good in the middle of the bed.  i suppose, it could be a positive concept to vary the adhesion... center less adhesion and outer edges better adhesion.  i'm sure that wasn't the intent, though.

for details... when i was assembling the printer fresh out of the box, i found that the small 2-pronged pinch clip that holds the ring-piece that holds the zipties + plastic tube (spinner?) had been crushed, probably during shipping (the box looked like it was someones step-stool,  ). both prongs were twisted and snapped uncleanly when i found both pieces in the box. so i don't, as far as i know, really have any way to salvage the part. 

so does anyone know if there's another way to get this handled?","we can send you a replacement, but the weekend has started, so that won't be until monday.

i don't completely understand your description, but i *think* it is non-critical. so, feel free to print without it. that said, if anything in the box is crushed that is a bad sign that there was damage, so there may be more issues.

we can get you a replacement part on monday if you email support@lulzbot.com. if it appears there is more damage to the unit, we can replace the whole thing.

pei kit for taz4,"i've been coveting the pei print surface since reading about it here. the issue has been that amazon has been out of stock with the adhesive sheets, so i have been putting off the upgrade. since reviewing the taz5 specs, i noticed the pei bed is now standard and the hex nozzle has been added. i already upgraded to the hex nozzle, which has been amazing apart from some minor firmware issues. i am still wanting the pei, but i was wondering if there are plans to release an upgrade kit directly from the fine folks at ao/lulzbot (my pref given the outstanding customer service) or if i should just look for another online source of the 3m adhesive. any thoughts would be grand. cheers!","mike,

taz 5 - questions,"hi guys.  i own a cheap 3d printer (wanhao 4x dual) which was decent to get me started with 3d printing and learning the ropes.  went from downloading designs and printing them to creating my own objects in the various open source cad programs.

i'm ready to buy a better 3d printer, looking for dual extruders, variety of materials (abs, pla, etc.), larger build capability, etc.

i like the published features of the new taz5.  some questions:

- most reviews favor and praise the taz4, with hardly nothing yet on the 5.   of all the criticisms, a review on 3d hubs said this about the taz4:  ""as mentioned before, the taz 4 is more suitable for printing large objects and does not cope well with small intricate prints.""  is this true?   i do want to print both large and small prints, and i want accuracy just as much as large volume.
- i'm used to an enclosed chamber for shielding abs during the print.   how well does the taz do with an open frame for abs printing?
- if i get the dual extruder, does the weight of the dual extruder assemply sag and cause problems between the center of the print bed versus the corners <or> are the guide rods sturdy enough to handle the dual extruder assembly?

think that's it, i've enjoyed reading the lulzbot forums, some talented people contributing to the posts  !

thanks !","the taz4 and 5 are exactly the same, except for the pei print bed and all metal hexagon hot end.  both very good upgrdes.  and the taz5 was introduced fairly recently so probably not as well established as the 4.

the pei is actually really good and conducive to printing without an enclosure.  i upgraded my smaller un-enclosed printer to pei, it was night and day.  adhesion on the bed was achieved primarily by increasing the first layer squash.  with the pei i was able to raise the initial z position by almost .5.  which resulted in more accurate bottom layers and preservation of detail.  

the taz would definitely benefit from an enclosure, but you can get away without one for 80% of prints.  brim usually helps, and i can say that i've only had to add brim to one or two prints in my first week with the taz5.

as for smaller intricate prints, the taz5 has done really well.  i printed a test calibration print consisting of a 60mmx60mm plate with hard corners, overhangs, cubes and pyramids...  all i can say is i'm impressed.  the corners and points were sharp.  the cubes were dimensionally accurate.  and it spanned the 1cm gap with no issue.

i haven't run the taz5 through any speed tests, but i can say that the s3d profile seems to print a little slower than my other printer.  i don't think the extra weight of the wades extruder really makes a difference... while it seems very bulky, the common stepper is the bulk of the weight.  of course a bowden setup would be optimal, but i've heard issues with extruding tpu/rubber based filaments.  again i don't think the lulzbot toolhead makes a big difference compared to other direct drive extruder."
new tool head v2 and ninja flex?,"just got my new tool head kit to put in my taz 4 and wanted to know if i can use it for printing ninja flex? it looks like around 1/4"" between the roller and filament entry, not sure if this is too much space and the filament will wrinkle and fold up like it did on the original.","tmorris9 wrote:kosmopi wrote:did you just say that the new tool head can print semi flex? sweet! does the budaschnozzle do that too?
actually i was asking if it can and the apparent answer is no.

both the buda and the all metal hotend can print ninjaflex and semiflex. but they need an extruder capable of feeding them the material. the standard taz toolhead and the new toolhead v2 can't print ninjaflex (well, not fast/reliably). the flexystruder can print ninjaflex. it uses the buda now. future versions will likely have an all metal hotend (e.g. a flexy v2)it is pretty straightforward, so people can probably make their own without too much trouble. but we don't have one done for a product yet. we'll have files here as we make it:

dual extruder: can this be produced cleanly?,"i'm buying the taz 5, what i'm trying to decide is if it's worth getting the dual extruder option?  i need to be able to print something like this, where the text is visible on the surface, and the surface is as smooth as possible (i was happy with the results of .15 when i printed the block itself with no text, and the block was oriented 90* to what is shown).



does anyone have something similar they could show me that they've printed with the dual extruder? also, if possible could someone take the stl files for this and give me a rough idea of how long it would take to print using the default settings for abs?  i'm pretty sure the quality might be better if it's printed 90* to the way i displayed it based on some other test printing i did ... but i'm definitely not sure of that (and i'm no expert).

thank you for any support and information you can share, will help with the purchasing decision  - keith","one thing to keep in mind is that the dual extruder uses the budaschnozzle and the taz 5 uses the newer hexagon hot end. that being said with enough time calibrating this piece it should come out nicely. however your best option, my personal opinion. is to just print the two parts separately and get the tolerances really close. then you can use glue or an acetone mix to attach the two pieces. then you can just sand down the surface to make it look like 1 piece."
hot end cools in the middle of a print,"my hot end keeps cooling down in the middle of prints.  i can get about 5 hours out of it then it just cools down.  the information screen shows that it is room temperature and that the target temp is 230.  i assumed it was the resistor so i replaced it but it is still happening.  when i test with a multimeter there is no power at the resistor, no power at the connector and no power before the connector.  there is power on the orange side but none on the red.  if i shut down the printer and home the taz, the hot end still wont heat up until i touch the red leads with a multimeter.  it then starts heating up, but will only work for a short time.
please help.","make sure that the printer is powered down and disconnected from the computer before testing. how does the board look? do you have clip on test leads you can use? if so, you can see if voltage is detectable coming out of the connector at the board- more specifically from the connector labeled heat 0 in this diagram. how do the components under that connector look?

metal shavings and clogged extruder,"hi all.

love my taz 4.  i have the standard 0.35mm extruder head that came with my taz 4.  recently the extruder has been getting clogged every two hours or so.  i take off the nozzle and soak it overnight, make it super nice and clean, clean out the hobbed bolt, and then put it back on and it prints fine for a couple of hours but then i have to repeat the process.  

in addition i've noticed that there are tiny, tiny metal shavings in the middle of the extruder assembly.  supplying a picture here.   there are lots of shavings and they fall onto the bed.  i've looked all around trying to figure out what is producing it but i can't figure it out.  



i'm printing with abs and have replicated the clogged extruder head with the standard octopus print (it has consistently failed on the 2nd octopus that i print - the first one turns out super awesome).  

any suggestions?

in addition can someone suggest the best video for complete extruder head disassembly?  there are lots of videos out there - i'm looking for the best one for the budaschnozzle 2.0.

thanks!

jason","i took apart the budaschnozzle tonight to try to discover the source of the metal flakes and shavings.  i found it here:



this was above the budaschnozzle and part of the feeding mechanism.  it is the end point of the hobbed bolt.

the picture is pretty clear.  about half of the ball bears have disintegrated.  does anyone know how this could have happened?  i'm thinking it was always in bad shape and has been steadily degrading.  i've had the printer for less than  a year and it sees fairly active use.  

also does anyone know if this part:  https://www.lulzbot.com/608-bearing-pack-of-8 is a replacement for this?  if not is there another somewhere?  i looked at the packing list of the budaschnozzle here http://download.lulzbot.com/budaschnozz ... il_box.pdf and didn't see this part.  but i also didn't see anything else that i thought would actually be the thing that i'm looking for.

taz 5 purchase,"hello all,

i am in the process of buying a taz 5 and i have a few questions:

1. it seems that the flexydually tool head has a bigger nozzle (0.5mm) as opposed to the normal head (0.35mm?).
according to the website ""each standard nozzle is .5mm which is optimized for flexible filaments, but this also limits the resolution that can be achieved with this tool head."" which is fine when i print flex or rigid & flex, but if i want to print in a finer res can i then swap out the single head? is that a moderately easy task?

2. can i replace one of the nozzles on the flexydually head to a smaller diameter?

3. is there a better option for using a twin head using flexable material.

4. what head for carbon fiber?

sorry for all of the questions from a total noob, but i only want to buy as close to what i need from the beginning.

thank you,
muggs","hiya!

1. you need  a larger nozzle orifice to print flexible materials at a decent speed. you can achieve fine resolution with a 0.50mm nozzle/hot end- by printing at finer layer heights. it's tempting to correlate nozzle diameter with print resolution, but it's not needed. see this thread on printing with at 0.50mm nozzle at 0.05mm layer height: viewtopic.php?f=37&t=845

2. you can, but it's not recommended. we would have equipped the flexystruder with a 0.35mm nozzle if we had found that it performed better. stick with the 0.50mm nozzle.

3. the dually flexy works well! https://www.lulzbot.com/products/lulzbo ... -tool-head

4. the stock head can print with it- but you're risking your hot end and nozzle. while carbon fiber filaments seem like a good idea, there hasn't been much testing to see how they perform compared to the stronger nylon filaments. it may not be worth it/ as strong as you'd think:
a special note on carbon fiber filament:
from: colorfabb.com
a special point of attention is the abrasive nature of the carbon fibers. in general these fibers will accelerate the nozzle-wear of brass nozzles, much faster than unfilled filaments. therefore we  recommend to use nozzle’s from stainless steel or hardened copper alloys.

while it's tempting to try using filament containing carbon fiber, many users are reporting trouble extruding after using that material, even from different vendors. we've seen people that wear out the inside of their nozzle, not to mention having lingering extrusion issues after switching to more common filament types.

one of the benefits of carbon fiber containing materials are it's strength, similarly to good quality plywood. the interlocking long carbon fiber strands give the material a super-strong core. all the filaments we've seen so far however, don't have that same kind of long carbon fiber strands, so your prints are similar to oriented strand board (cheaper plywood with smaller fiber length), which isn't as strong or as durable. that somewhat defeats the purpose of using carbon fiber materials.

we find that for applications needing high-strength printed parts nylon is a great material. while a bit slower to print, the parts are much, much stronger."
new user seeking advice,"hello everyone,

i am looking at getting a 3d printer.  i was formerly looking at a hyrel 3d given it can go to 4 print heads and has the ability to print malleable substances like play dough and clay as well as sugru.  however, i am tired of waiting to see availability (over a year).

so, i have moved on.  i am now looking at the taz as well as ultimaker.  i am expecting to place an order within the next week.  for several reasons i am leaning toward taz but i had some questions that the faq didn't seem to cover or cover well.  

as for me, a little about my background and abilities might help in answering some of my questions later.

i know the taz has a rep for not being easy to assemble.  its really a non-factor for me.  i don't have an issue with assembling things.  i am an avid reloader and reload several pistol and rifle calibers.  i assembled and run two reloading presses and i have an eye for detail and accuracy.  frankly if i can assemble, tune, repair and run these:

i am pretty sure assembling a taz will be a walk in the park.  there was considerable assembly of my laser (mentioned below) machine.

i have a strong electronics, computer and mechanical background and i have been a web/sql programmer for 15 years.  i have a strong 3d background (modo, solidworks, ,etc) as well.

i currently own a 50w co2 laser cutter/engraving machine so i am no stranger to computer>machine linking and programming.  in fact some of my questions tie into the laser.

some things i intend on printing include add-on parts for my reloading presses as well as some tools i have thought up and would like to print economically.  a couple things right away that i am looking at wanting to do is lids for the above pictured press's brass and bullet feeder hoppers.  they are damn noisy and lids (with maybe some foam core sound absorbing layers) will make a big difference.  i have several friends with the same press so i am likely to want to run multiple copies once i work the design out. i am also looking at eventually printing gun parts (grips, cases, holsters, mags and lowers for example) mainly for the fun of having creative colors.  i was looking at the wood filaments for pistol grips as a creative idea.  also on the list are some every day items for the kids.  maybe unique christmas gifts and such.  lots of other stuff running around my brain but yet to get a good grip on how to do them.  experience will sort those out i suspect.

so, here come the noob questions...and if there is a guide or faq somewhere that covers a question, hey, links are appreciated too.  i like to read up on stuff, i just need a nudge in the right direction.

1. do yall think the taz is the better machine?  i am looking for accuracy, reliability and eventually build size.  ease of assembly, not really a concern.  reasonable ease of getting started but i don't need a cube if you get my drift.  i do arduino programming if that helps 

2. until recently i had only heard of abs and pla filaments.  i see there are quite a few new ones on the market now.  can someone explain the different ones (and their advantages/disadvantages) or point me toward a guide somewhere that does?  i mean on this site alone there is abs, pla, ninjaflex, semiflex, t-glase, taulman bridge nylon, taulman 618 nylon, laybrick, laywood, natural pva, hips, polycarbonate.  of all those there are only 4 video profiles.  from other sites theres stuff like colorfabb metals and pet/pet+.  then there is lots of crazy stuff like foam and gel as well as oddballs like pctpe.

3.  are there fumes to worry about when printing?  i have an air handling system for the laser (obvious fumes there eh?) but its in the basement and i was looking at putting the taz upstairs in a computer room.  wondering if thats a good ide or not.

4.  i see a multitude of nozzles for the taz.  is there documentation as to why to use one nozzle over another on particular builds?  is there a commonly bought nozzle that i should consider buying along with the taz right out of the box?

5. is there a dual head capable of ninja flex in both nozzles and abs in both nozzles?  i would rather not have to swap heads if i want to use 2 colors of abs or 2 colors of flex or 1 abs and one flex.  not a deal breaker if its not a possibility for technical reasons.

6. i have seen reviews complaining about the mass of the taz's head.  is that really a big deal?

7. are there certain filaments that are good starters for learning techniques on without breaking the bank on scraps?

8. does the surface the taz sits on have to be absolutely level?  i am assuming not but thought it a good question to ask.

9. does anyone have any experience and knowledge on laser cutting/etching printed parts?  are there dangers involved?  pvc is an absolute no-no (produces corrosive and hazardous gases).  any common filaments that are also known to be a bad idea to laser?

10.  are there any suggested accessories or spare parts i should get for the taz right away when i order the taz?  i hate needing something and waiting on it to be shipped.

11. lastly, is there any good software that i should expect to need?  i own modo though its an older version.  anything else i need to be looking at?

i will greatly appreciate any help yall can lend to a noob just getting into the pool.","hello 

1. if you like to tinker with your machine, then this is the printer for you. all designs are opensource and available online. half the printer is printable/replaceable/upgradeable.

2. pla is a common low temp, biodegradable material able to easily print large parts. rigid slightly brittle, it is well suited for models, show prints, and light duty functional pieces. new special types of pla are being released such as semiconductive pla, uv-responsive, and glow in the dark.
abs is a higher temp, durable material that we use to print all our own printer parts. wears slowly as opposed to snapping like pla, it is good for smaller structural parts. printing large parts is a challenge due to contraction and layer separation.
t-glase, polycarbonates, and high tensile polyester materials like tritan from taulman are all beautiful, strong, translucent materials, though some require higher temperatures than the standard budaschnozzle permits. upgrading to an all metal hexagon hot end from lulzbot is highly recommended for these as well as other high temp materials like nylons, which are also incredibly durable, acetone safe, and easily colored using water-based dyes.
ninjaflex (tpu) is a highly durable elastomer, suitable for many applications in which you require a rubber-like material, whether flexible or fairly rigid thanks to the new semiflex material. ninjaflex materials all require the upgraded flexystruder to print, and print quite easily with this upgrade.
exotic materials like laywood and laybrick are fun to make novelty models mainly, although i have seen some beautiful wooden prosthetic hands printed a few months ago, proving that useful models are also very possible.
much if this info and more can be found on lulzbot's filament guide here: https://www.lulzbot.com/sites/all/theme ... _guide.pdf

3. unlike edlink, i do sit next to two printers 8+ hours a day and never have any issues with fumes at standard operating temps. our cluster operators are in a room with 135 taz's round the clock and it has never been an issue.

4. .35 nozzles are a good balance between detail and speed. move to a .5mm if you want improved speed and reliability (harder to clog). i wouldn't recommend changing nozzles much due to stripping issues unless you apply a nice antiseize.

5. there is no dualflexy head yet, just the flexydually which prints with one firm and one flexy material. to print with two standard materials you will want to save one budaschnozzle for use with ninjaflex only, as it is hard to purge with standard filaments. then swap out another budaschnozzle with a .5mm nozzle and a standard extruder body onto the front extruder and voilà.

6. this means we cannot print quite as fast as printers with a lighter head in theory. so far, pun intended, it has never really slowed me down.

7. hips is a cheap and easy to use filament. its properties are smack between abs and pla and looks nice.

8. we have printed upside down without any issue, and i am hoping for zero-gravity testing, which should work fine.

9. i'll leave this one to someone else. i'm sure you can find material properties for any of the common printing materials heated to laser etching temps.

10. and extra resistor is always a good investment, and printing a small herringbone gear with the abs that comes with the taz is a good idea too:

11. cura!

getting rough top layers with hexagon hotend,"i have been trying different settings, but i always get pretty rough top layers using the new hexagon hotend in my taz4.

does anyone have noticed this effect using the new hotend ?

inaki.","mhackney wrote:esteps are not dependent on the hotend, only the extruder. if you are using the same extruder, you do not need to recalibrate. extruder calibration is how many steps it takes to extrude 1mm of filament. the hotend does not factor in.

what size nozzle does the stock buddashnozzle and hexagon come with?

i am assuming he bought the whole extruder assembly for the hexagon which means he does need to calibrate the esteps. however whenever i got new assemblies from lulzbot they always attached a tag with the calibrated esteps."
new tool head v2 first thoughts review,"installed my new all metal tool head today (purchased from lulzbot). install was fairly straight forward though i wish they had included a clear drawing of the large plug to show where pins 5 & 6 were. the plugs don't have those numbers on them since they are in the center and there is no room but i figured it out.

after getting it installed and uploading the new firmware (required) i went through calibration but i was having a bit of an issue as my measurements kept coming up different, i finally figured out that for some reason i needed to tighten the idle roller down much tighter than i use to on the older one (filament kept slipping, maybe it has a higher pressure build up). anyway got that done.

calibrated the z axis and i was ready to print. first test print was perfect.

now for the whole reason i bought the new tool head : all metal hot end. i always had layer adhesion issues with abs. i always felt it was due to the limit of 240c on the budaschnozzle. so after making sure everything was calibrated i designed a small part with thin (1.5mm) parts sticking up (think fingers on gopro mounts). i had always been able to easily break these fingers by squeezing them together in my fingers, you could then look at the break and see white where the break was strongest and the material color where it was week and these gopro like fingers were normally about half white when broken meaning that there was half of the material that was not fully joined.

well i printed the small test part at 260c to see how it would compare, now the fingers are actually a little narrower than the gopro mounts (to give a worst scenario test) well, it was hard to break when i squeezed it and the entire broken surface was bright white meant it was as strong as it could be and it had a full bond.

i believe that this will also help with tall thin items from cracking as they go up (like many boxes i printed in the past with abs). it may not prevent warping but i do have a build chamber for this. 

conclusion: even though i had hoped i could use flexible material with this (you can't) new tool head, i am very glad so far that i have it and i plan to delve into more filaments that are better suited to higher temps.

thanks lulzbot!","i installed the fangtooth on my taz4 a couple of days ago and i made a thread for it. being inattentive i threw this up in the general hardware forum but have a look at it. the nozzle has been a great upgrade for me. viewtopic.php?f=7&t=1718

i know the pei bed is on the way as an individual component (and i'll be snapping that up straightaway, trust me)
is it really that great of an upgrade? i currently use a ~20 line brim for abs and can print parts that take up the entire bed space without warping issues but it would be sweet if i did't have to. is the pei sheet much lighter than the glass bed? i have my taz4.5 printing at 175mm/s with the acceleration set at 2000--trying to get it to print beyond um2--so the weight reduction in the y axis would be a bonus for me."

hotend issues,"this is what i have sent off to support any ideas what may have caused this issue? have you experience anything similar to this?
hello, 
well i seem to have another problem and thought it would be okay to simply reply to this email instead of sending a new one. the hot end on the taz 4 will not go above 36c and ""failed"" sometime during my print. i was printing abs for roughly five hours came back to find that the hot end had decreased from 235 down to 37-36 by itself. the hot end was cool to the touch and the filament as far as i can tell had no wear(the main turning gear was not moving during this process). i attempted to changed the temp via the control option, but was still listed under 235 and changing the temp to 230 made little difference. the hot bed itself maintained a steady temperature of 85 till i restarted the machine. even after the machine restarted the hot end would not go past 36, but instead would idle at this temp. i'm currently using the ""old"" hot end as my complementary all metal hot end is still in the mail. any help getting the hot end working again would be greatly appreciated! thanks for the help, jordan.","tmorris9 wrote:this could be anything from a broken wire going to the resistor in the hotend or a resistor gone bad. could also be a blown mosfet or fuse.

if you have a multimeter you can check the continuity of the resistor to see if its open. it should read around 5 ohms but anything close means it's not open. also examine the small wires and crimp connectors going to the resistor and thermister to see if they appear unbroken (the tiny crimp joints have failed on me before).

next i would say smell the controller box (where the holes are for the fan) if the mosfet blew it will likely stink. don't have a multimeter, but can say that there is no smell emitting from the taz. i attempted to heat the hot end again but it will not leave a temp of 27 now. could the element of went bad?

better print quality,"hello everyone,

check out strategy #9 in my  a strategy for successful (and great) prints. it really is best to understand the characteristics of the filaments you use, it's easy to do and you'll get much better and more consistent results. in the case of pla, richrap did some interesting work last year varying the temperature of pla as he printed. it has a visual effect on the print, hotter pla resulted in a glossier finish, cooler in a more matte finish. he used this to great effect to produce some stunning vases.

i keep a word document that lists each of the filaments i use and the characteristics for them. i don't repeat one-for-one, for instance, i have a generic pla that about 30 of my filaments fit into so i just add the filament vendor and color to that existing entry. most of the common entries have a matching material configuration in kisslicer (my slicer of choice) but you can do this in any slicer. this way, when i come back to a filament later i don't have to start from scratch. 

while you are reading my strategy post, scroll to the bottom and read the section on layer tuning. you can use the simple stls i posted to help tune your filament and understand their temperature to speed characteristics. it really isn't difficult or time consuming to do and it does result in much improved print quality. try it!

cheers,
michaelhello michael again! 
  i'm glad to say i have read your impressive guide, but the question remains is the filament type/properties one of the most important factors in a great print? like you stated in the guide it is best to measure and record notes about the current used filament. so i guess my question is, if filament is  seemingly if not the backbone of a great print are there ""superior"" brands of filament? would you say the lulzbot(or any other) brand will change per package of the filament compared to the last print properties? would there be an advantage to say running red filament that produces the same quality prints as y filament at nearly double the print speed(would this be possible)? is there a certain filament you prefer over the rest? also i believe sense this is still all relatively new (1st week printing ever) is there any recommended reading material/guides that deals directly with lulzbots printers or the basic beginners guide. would love to contribute to this seemingly fantastic community in the future. thanks for the great information, prime.

sidenote: how often do the properties of the filament change per person? would there be a benefit if there was a community posted ""filament journal"" on google docs for quick reference?"

taz4 resonance on the y-axis?,"i got my taz a few weeks ago (it's my first printer) and its been running great - my knowledge of printers/hardware is really limited at the moment, so if i make any mistakes please let me know.

there's quite a noticeable resonance/vibrations when its moving along the y-axis around the midpoint of the plate. if i move it with the nozzle low (few mm's from the plate), its very noticeable when going to y-home (but there's nothing in the opposite direction). if i move the extruder up (around 50mm and beyond in the z-axis) then it's noticeable when moving away from y-home. its pretty noisy/the table its on vibrates strongly when it occurs and though i mainly notice it when moving the extruder around (via printrun) but it's noticeable during prints as well.

use one extruder with dual extruder,"i just built the flexy dually extruder for my taz4 because i want to be able to print with either abs or ninjaflex, and sometimes with both.  when i try to print with just abs (waiting for ninjaflex to come) the taz seems to wait for the flexystruder to get to temperature, which is set to 0 in simplify3d.  the only way i can make it print is to use the lcd and manually set the flexystruder temp to match the temp shown on the info screen and sometimes this is difficult since heating 1 extruder causes the other one to heat up a little too..  how can i make the printer work with just 1 extruder an ignore the other one?","so in simplify3d i discovered the way to do this is to create a process for each extruder, i made one called abs for my primary extruder and one called flexy for my flexystruder.  then when you import a part you can assign it to either process and when you print it only heats the selected extruder.  

if you have split stl files for a dual extruder part you can import both stl files and assign each one to the process with the desired extruder and print both together (i haven't tried this yet).  

if you want to use one extruder for the part and another extruder for infill or support you can create a process with 2 extruders and then in the process settings assign the desired extruder for infill or support as desired and print.  

the problem i had originally is that if you create a process with 2 extruders it will heat both even if your part is only using one of them, the trick to using only one extruder at a time is to only have one extruder in your process, but you can have as many processes as you want and assign any part you are printing to whichever process you want.

the other thing to be aware of in simplify3d is the difference between a process and a factory file.  a factory file contains all the processes you have defined, but you can't save an individual process.  so a factory file is an aggregate of processes, but you can also have multiple factory files.  (i suppose you could save a factory file with a single process for one extruder and save another factory file with a single process for a different extruder.)  it's a bit of a challenge to determine how to organize your factory files and processes to keep track and find everything for particular stl files.

the simplify3d tutorial files are great but i wish they would publish a detailed manual that explains each setting in the program for each menu item.  the saving grace is that simplfy3d support has been very responsive and very helpful to me.

odd pattern printing a flat box,"i get this odd pattern when printing a flat box first layers; it is a 100x100x1.2mm box. 
the darker side in the picture is the first layer.

pla prints are curling off the bed,"this is yet another post about bed adhesion difficulties. i searched this forum for advice and tried a few things but my current print is showing the same issue so i'm hoping this will yield some new ideas.

my setup is a kittaz w/ standard extruder and hot end and a 1/16"" pei sheet clamped onto the bed. i also have the dual duct fan installed on the hot end to keep air flowing around the heat sink. i have been using the silver pla from lulzbot. i like to use simplify3d for slicing and have tried the following setting combos, all to similar effect:

 190º head, 60º bed, 60mm/s default speed, 0.2mm layer height, 30% 1st layer speed, 120% 1st layer height, 100% fan
 180º head, 80º bed, 60mm/s default speed, 0.14mm layer height, 35% 1st layer speed, 90% 1st layer height, 100% fan
 180º head, 60º bed, 60mm/s default speed, 0.22mm layer height, 50% 1st layer speed, 90% 1st layer height, 100% fan

i've carefully checked three times that the bed is level. the prints come off with a gentle pull but seem fixed to the bed well enough. the curling never begins right away, but rather after the first few layers or even later. my (inexperienced) gut feeling is that this is mainly a temperature problem but i don't know where to go with that hunch. i have made a handful of successful prints, but nearly all of them exhibit this problem to some degree. i've also experienced this when printing on the pet surface.

the photos are of a failed print of the maker faire articulated robot figure http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:331035.","for me, pla likes to pull up on corners where there's a sharp change in direction, just like the arms in your photo.  seems like the head is pulling too much on what it lays down.  you might try turning down your fan, or going to 195 c.  i was having the problem a lot at 180 c, 60 c bed, gizmodorks dark blue pla.  it's much better for me at 192 c, 60 c bed.

i also had a lot of weak layer adhesion at 180 c.  parts were solid, no loose traces, but flexing them produced a lot of crackle.  it didn't take much to pull them apart.  at 192 c, they're very solid, much stronger.

hotend no temp. heater is working,"hello,

thanks orias. i've managed to solve the problem. the heater resistor wires needed to be stripped again, at the end coming to the rambo. everything is replaced and back to normal.

taz4 printing problems,"hey friends,

long time fan, first time poster. i'm attempting to print a calibration rig, but the prints themselves are just not working out. as you can see in the following images - taz seems to occasionally be missing the perimeters. i wasn't sure if this infact was the taz's fault, or the .gcode. any thoughts?

broke bed corner/clip during first bed level attempt?,"howdy all.  noob here.  got my taz 4 a couple days ago, and tried the bed leveling procedure (haven't printed yet) and i think when tightening the clip on the front right side of the bed, during the bed level, i may have broken the clip (it won't raise or lower and it's not firm like the other three, and the top part just pulls right off) and perhaps i broke the bed too with chipped glass in the corner.  i'm guessing i did this from tightening the screw too much in this corner.  so just a couple questions.

first, could i just re-calibrate the z stop to work with this corner of the bed i can't raise or lower, and then raise and lower the other three corners to compensate?

second, if i did that, would it be a problem heating the bed with the cracked glass?

thanks for any help offered.  was really hoping to print with this bad boy this weekend, but seems i messed it up right off the bat.  pics attached.","as a follow up, in case anybody reads this, the glass was just chipped and barely and i was able to level the bed just using the other three corners.  i have printed about four things, one thing successfully, and the bed level seems okay."
broken psu voltage selector,"hi everybody.
i have received my taz 4 printer today. 
when unboxing i have realized the psu input voltage selector switch (110/230v) was lose inside the psu.
i was unable to change the switch from 110 to 230v or back because it was totally out of place.

then i have opened the psu and have found the problem. the slider should be attached to a small pcb with four hooks. two of them were out of place. it has a small spring inside that holds the switch in place once you select the 110/230 position.

now i am able to move the switch up and down but, i do not know which position i should put the slide ! 
the switch is simetrical and can be placed up or down.

as you may know, the slide is placed near the ac power input. 
my question for you is. in your psu, if you would need to set the slide to 230v, do you slide the switch *towards* the ac input connector or to the oposite side ?

slightly gloppy edges (pla),"just made my very first print today with my newly operational kittaz!

i printed up a herringbone gear that i want to use to help a friend with his art project. overall i think it came out decently. modeled with openscad, sliced with cura.

 0.1mm layer height
 lulzbot silver pla
 180º nozzle, 60º bed
 fan on (stock shroud)
 uhu glue stick directly on glass (no pet)
 50mm / sec speed

for a sense of scale, the gear is about 12mm thick. interestingly the first half of the print is definitely worse than the second. attached are some detail photos of trouble area. i had quite a hard time getting it off of the bed, but some water and a cheese slicer did the trick.

edit i forgot to mention: i did an extruder calibration test by extruding 100mm of filament and measuring the actual length extruded and it was so close (within 1 or 2mm) that i didn't even bother to adjust the steps in the firmware.

i would love feedback on how i might improve my quality. thanks!","thanks for the reply. i am using the standard lulzbot taz profiles for cura. looking at the gcode that cura generated for my models, i can see m106 commands sprinkled throughout with different values for each layer. most are high (between 230 and 255) but some early on are lower (below 50). i remember reading at one point that less fan can help the first layers adhere better to the heated bed.

this morning i held my finger in front of the small fan duct pointed at the head of the nozzle and couldn't feel any air moving. i can feel plenty of air escaping around the back of the fan. could there be something wrong with my fan mount / shroud / fan? i am now printing out the recommended dual duct fan (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:374906) but i guess this will actually reduce airflow to the nozzle.

i also noticed this morning that some pla had flowed out of the heater block of the nozzle and onto the nozzle itself. i've read in a few other posts here about the same phenomenon so i heated up the extruder, removed the nozzle and put some teflon tape in there before replacing it. hopefully that will protect against that issue.

"single and dual extruder hotends, can i freely swap them?","hi all,

i have a taz 4, which had the single extruder hotend it originally shipped with, and it was working and printing fine.  i later picked up the dual extruder hotend and went through the process of upgrading the firmware for dual extrusion.  i have been happily printing abs / hips with it now for a while.  

however, now i want to switch back to the single hotend for a bit (which has a fan) and dedicate this original hotend for printing pla.  when i did the swap and turned it on i just get a ""err: mintemp"" message on the display when i power it on.  i reconnected to the original ""black"" cables coming from the power supply.

my question to you is it possible (supported) to swap between these hotends, and if so is there a setting or something i need to flip to get it working again?

i also noticed one some other threads that some folks said it could be a disconnected or broken wire, but i don't see anything obviously disconnected, and it was packed away with care ?  any troubleshooting tips folks have would be welcome.

thanks,
steve","there's two options currently for those wanting to switch between the single extruder toolhead and the dual extruder toolhead:

* reflash the firmware from dual > single when you switch back and forth as the firmware expects to see two extruders when enabled and will prevent you from doing things as a form of fault protection.

or

* leave the dually firmware installed. purchase a 100k honeywell thermistor and make a short jumper that attaches to the orange wire pair on the second extruder. the firmware will detect the thermistor on the second extruder harness and will function normally, save for only having one hot end/extruder.

for the official dual extruder design, very important. standard length motors won't fit. here are some pictures of the lulzbot dual extruder. i'm not 100% certain this is identical to the final production model, and i'm not sure i'm at liberty to disclose it's source, but lets just leave it at ""i didn't print this one"". you can see that the half height motors clear the second extruder, and the full length motor sitting on top won't. i've been playing around with one of the extruders just in single configuration to see how well it holds up, and the motor has plenty of torque and horsepower. as soon as i finish the taz 4 end upgrade and get the lighting subsystem mounted i'll have this guy on the machine and turning out some neat things. i ordered the wrong bearings for my 4 ends though, so thats been a bit on hold. i'm getting caught up though finally. anyways, heres some pictures of it.

a little stuck here.,"i got my taz4 a couple days ago and am a little stuck. i installed the software and have aligned the bed (not real happy with the z-stop, seems a bit inaccurate and finicky but will work on that later). i have pronterface working and planned to start with the files on the memory card. the nozzle is .35 and i am using abs, and have tried printing the small octopus abs file with little to no success. it seems that by the time it gets through a couple of layers it is having filament feed issues, namely it is wearing a groove in the filament so it can no longer feed and it just prints in the air so to speak. i've tried all different tension settings and even raising the extruder temp to 245 with no success. ive tried jet abs and ic3d brand abs with same results. when the extruder feeds properly it seems to work ok but that doesn't last for long as it ultimately ends with the feeding problem. i'm sure i'm overlooking something, what else on the machine or in pronterface should i adjust? what about print speed? pronterface defaults to 300mm/min i believe, is this range realistic? any help will be appreciated. thanks, greg","gghouck wrote:so, i set the temp to 230 and little changed. i'm simply trying to print the small octopus abs file from the sd card, not sure exactly where to change the extrusion speed, as i've seen it in a couple places. 

one thing that seems wrong is that when raise the extruder and extrude in air, i don't get a stream of filament but rather a glob on the end of the nozzle. it also takes way longer for the material to come out than it does for the machine to feed the filament. what i mean is that with the extruder in the air, i use the 'extrude' button in prontface to feed 5mm, which takes a second for the stepper to do that, but the material keeps squirting out for several seconds longer. it's sounding to me like the nozzle is no good.

it seems as it is now i can't even get the bed calibration print to work. this thing jams literally seconds into trying to do anything.

how compressed are the two springs on the extruder? also, in pronterface on the lower left hand corner, what is the manual extrusion speed set at (mm/min)?

help with pla filament problems,"i'm having a lot of trouble getting prints to finish, so any clues, suggestions or encouragement will be greatly appreciated.

problem 1
the filament (pla, 180 deg, 50 deg) is now stuck in the extruder (.35). on this day the first print stopped extruding after about 10 mins. so i stopped the print, pulled out the filament (with difficulty), cleaned the knurled gear and pushed in a fresh filament end. i was able to manually extrude so i started the print again. this time it ran for about 5 mins then stopped extruding. i tried to pull out the filament but it is stuck. i heated it to 210 and tried to pull it out with pliers (even leveraging it against the frame) but it is stuck. the only plan i have now is to remove the extruder and then try to remove the nozzle and soak it all in acetone. has anyone else had this problem or have other suggestions?

problem 2
sometimes the printer stops extruding because the filament spool gets stuck. i the have to try and unroll enough to get started again and then every 15 mins have to manually unroll until it's done. this is very annoying for a long print. i don't have this problem with abs, only pla. is there something i can do to prevent the reel from getting stuck?

problem 3
if a print happens to finish (rare), the last layer is very rough. i think i saw a suggestion on how to help this but can't find it now. any suggestions?

thanks ,
dennis","problem 1

it's generally not a good idea use the same budaschnozzle for pla and abs. when printing with pla, the left over abs will clog the nozzle.

i have separate extruders for abs and pla.

pla requires that the budaschnozzle be cooled. without a fan blowing on the cooling fins, the pla will creep up the nozzle and clog it.

in my opinion, the dual fan ducts are not totally effective, although they will help with the problem. this is because the air is split between the two channels and the fan is not always on (as it needs to be whenever the nozzle is hot).

i use this fan duct:

http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:368303

it mounts on the left side, and notice that it is thinner so that it doesn't bang into the left side of the printer.

i have it wired to the 2nd extruder fan connection and the marlin firmware modified so that the fan comes on automatically at 50 deg celsius.

problem 2

what brand filament are you using? i've never had a roll of lulzbot filament get stuck but have had the problem with some other brands.

make sure your idler springs on the extruder are tight enough. for pla, i've had to really tighten mine.

problem 3

i use a 0.4 extrusion width for the top infill (all solid infills, actually). this produces a pretty smooth finish. the triffid hunter guide recommends using a 0.5 width.

print bed is fianlly level,"my eye and ""feel"" for leveling the print bed using the paper method is lousy.  misspent youth i suppose...  anyway it seemed to me that since the extruder goes in and out so easily that would be a good way to mount a dial indicator.  i modified the stl file for the extruder holder to attach an indicator.  see http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:551366 if interested.

i adapted your design for my dial indicator and i'm very happy with it. thanks a lot. 

question though - to check height of all corners and middle did you simply move the table and printer carriage by hand? 

when i unplug the taz printhead and install the dial indicator, pronterface will no longer let me move the x/y axis through its interface."
problem using flashair sd card,"hello, 

  has anyone tried to use a flashair sd card with the taz4? i have the sd card configured and setup so i can write to it over wifi when it is in other devices. however when i install it into the taz4 i can successfully read the information, however the wifi does not turn on.  i was wondering if anyone else has tried this, and if there was a firmware update for this. i know several people have had success with this card in different 3d printers but i could not find any  info on the taz4. i am thinking that it might be some sort of power conservation thing going on but am not certain.",that's neat! have any links to what you're doing? that's a cool idea. i don't think we've played with those cards yet.
where is the pet?,"i have been happily using my taz 4 for a week. i love it.  i read in the forums that it is really bad to print straight on the glass and you have to use the pet sheet....what pet sheet? reading the manual would suggest that it is installed prior to shipping, but i can't see it. i even tried to peel the edge up, but there doesn't look as though there is anything to peel. do i have one? how do you tell? i noticed that i could see the image of the octopus and bed calibration prints, so they must have been printed on the same surface that i am using. i can't see or feel anything but glass. what is this pet thing?","austbots wrote:yep, it looks exactly like that.

so the ""sandwich"" you see there is an orange heating element glued to the bottom of a clear piece of ~1/8 inch thick glass, and a green pet sheet stuck to top of glass. the pet sheet has adhesive on one side so it's stuck very well to the glass. 

if you disconnect the wires to the heaters and unbolt the corners you can take the glass off and peel the pet off the glass so that you can apply a new sheet. putting new sheet down is a little tricky. you'll want some dish soap and water and a squeegie to smooth out the airbubbles. 

whoever, or whatever applies the pet sheet at the lulzbot factory does a spectacular job. the first few times you do it things won't look so pretty.  "

heated bed always registers 1c below set temp,"so i am new to the taz 4 (but not to 3d printing). i am trying to control the printer in software (simplify 3d and repetier host) but there is an issue with them waiting to heat up the bed. you see if i set the bed to 85c (per lulzbot) it only goes to 84c.

the problem with this is that both programs won't do anything (like print) until the set temp is reached. i let it set 10 minutes after reaching 84 and it never gets to 85. if i set it to 86 it gets to 85 and so on.

i can of course manually bypass this in in repetier but not simplify 3d (at least not that i know of). but the point is i should not have to go to those extra steps each and every time. i assume the controller is being cautious about overshooting the bed temperature or something. the hotend does overshoot then corrects itself so why not the heated bed and more importantly how can i fix this?","i got the taz4 earlier this month. life got busy but finally got to play with it on the weekend and i have the same problem. the heated bed never reached the desire temperature. spend  the whole weekend to figure it out. i have never owned or used a 3d printer before.

it was a very frustrating two days but i end up learning a lot. i learn a lot about g-code, eeprom setting, flashing firmware, slic3r setting, embedded g-code and the configuration.h file. i also found some error in lulzbot's support pages.
i wanna share what i learn but please excuse me for a very long post.

the reason why the heated bed never reach the desire temperature is because the pid value for the heated bed stored in the firmware were uncalibrated.

if you are not familiar with pid, these are value that allows the printer to stabilize the heated bed's temperature. with the wrong pid value the heated will never reach the correct and stable temperature. not only it has to reach the temperature it has to be stable.

every lulzbot is supposed to be calibrated and come with the optimum pid value in the firmware.

one can check the printer's pid value for the heated bed by sending g-code m304 to the printer
one can also figure out the ideal pid value for one's printer by doing an autotune.
this is outlined in the following support page:
https://www.lulzbot.com/support/fine-tu ... d-settings
the only problem is there is error in the page in regarding to saving the pid setting in the eeprom which i'll explain later.

so first i send m304 to my printer and i got the following;
""ok p:20 i:5 d:275""

i then do the auto tune
this is what i got:
 ""clasic pid
 kp: 120.89
 ki: 11.05
 kd: 330.77
pid autotune finished! put the kp, ki and kd constants into configuration.h""

hey!! that's way different from what's in my printer.

turns out the pid value for the heated bed in my printer is the default value for the marlin firmware.
my printer never got a set of calibrated value put in.

at this juncture of my adventure i did not know how to flash a firmware or know anything about the file configuration.h.

so i follow the instruction listed in the support page and entered the pid value using the m304 follow by m500 assuming i can just store the proper value in eeprom without flashing a new firmware.
everything work until you turn off the computer. the pid value never got stored in the eeprom. the support page is in error in regards to storing the heated bed pid value in the eeprom.
the heated bed pid values are never stored in the eeprom. it has to be hard code into the firmware configuration.h file.

if one do a m503 to query what's stored in the eeprom, one will find out only the extruder pid values are stored in eeprom and not the heated bed pid values.

that took me a full day to figure out!!!!!  

so next thing i have to do is to figure out how to flash the firmware. 
lulzbot have a support page for that:
https://www.lulzbot.com/support/re-flas ... s-firmware

i do play with arduino so i have no issue with installing and using the ide. i also find out according to the support page that version 1.01 has to be use.
no luck with the 1.01 version downloaded from the lulzbot site. keep getting compiler error.
turns out i need to use a new u8glib libraries for the arduino ide. it is actaully included in the sd card that came with the printer. i just copy the u8glin library from the sd card and paste into the arduino library folder and voila it compiled and i was  able to flash the firmware.

also if you search hard enough in their website there is two version of firmware for the taz4. one is the 2014q2 and the other the newer 2014q3. the only difference after comparing the two is the value for the setting of the z-axis and extruder. anyway both firmware did not have the correct value for my version of taz4. i have to manually put in the correct value listed in the paper work that came with my printer.

i also find out why if you use slic3r that it takes forever for the print to start or never start if the pid value is off. if you set  bed temperature in the filament setting to a certain value than slic3r will send the following embedded g-code:

""m190 s90 ; wait for bed temperature to be reached""

the print will not start until you can pass this line.
the printer will wait until the bed reach the correct temperature and stabilize for 10 secs before it goes to the next line of the code.
if the pid value are not the right one than obviously it won't work. even with the calibrated pid value set in the firmware it still take one to two minutes for the temperature to stabilize once it get within 0.2 degree of the set value.

one way around it is to set all the temperature setting to zero and preheat manually through the lcd or pronterface. no embedded g-code will be sent and the print will start immediately you hit print. just make sure the extruder and bed are at the right temperature before you start. you can adjust the temp down manually after the first few layers are print.

sorry again for the long post.
i have posted a lot of information and please feel free to ask if you need any clarification.

btw if you have netflix don't miss ""print the legend""

what manner of sorcery is this?,"my taz 4 was humming along beautifully completing my latest model when i walked away from it for about the last 10 minutes of the print.  when i returned i was greeted with this horrifying sight!

apparently, having finished the print, taz became dissatisfied with the quality of the work and decided to destroy it and himself at the same time.

this is what happens when you screw up one line of code in your shutdown routine.  i neglected to set relative coordinates when i attempted to retract the head 5mm from the part before homing it.  so instead of a retract, i got an absolute move to z=5mm.  or at least that's what taz tried to do.

uh, just a note.  don't do this.  took me 6 hours to clean this up.","i am not a g code expert, but i suspect the problem is at the end of your print where the g1 z5 command is given.  it looks like this is moving the print head to a height of 5mm when your object is 42.89mm high."
very low extrusion rate after pla clog,"hi all,

a couple weeks ago i was trying to print something using pla at very low speeds, and i was hit by the somewhat infamous heat creep issue where filament ends up melting in the ptfe tube.  i took my extruder apart and was able to clear the clog after soaking the tube in some boiling water to soften the pla that was stuck in the tube.

a couple of weeks passed and life intervened so i havent gotten back to printing.  but today i was finally able to try again.  i wanted to print out some very simple calibration parts to try end better understand some of the various settings in the slic3r profiles, since blindly setting things to be very slow is probably what ended up causing the clog in the first place.

i am finding today that the extruder is barely laying down any material.  i'm just getting a very thin, wispy strand laying down on the bed (or rather, that's mostly failing to adhere to the bed because there's so little of it).  if i manually force filament in to the head it flows, but lacking a force probe in my hand i cant say for sure whether i had to push this hard in the past.  is the problem likely to be due to some error i made in reassembling the extruder head, or will i have to take things apart and do a more thorough job of cleaning the ptfe tube?

if i have to better clean the tube, how should i go about doing that?  everyone always says ""soak it in acetone"" but my understanding is that acetone is not effective on pla.  i would give it a shot but i dont have any on hand.  my research has never really turned up what would be an effective solvent for pla.  i use isopropyl alcohol to clean my print bed but i think that's mostly just removing my finger oils from the bed.  is the lack of a good, relatively safe solvent one of the reasons why some people stay away from pla?

would it be easier to just replace the stupid tube?  i probably would have ordered a new one already if i had seen a 3mm tube on the lulzbot shop.

thanks!","thanks for the replies!  i'm just getting back to my printer after the holiday.

i think that i have *mostly* resolved the problem, but i do still have a question about idler tension aimed at trying to avoid this problem again in the future.  i spent a bunch of time trying various things to clean up and make sure i have properly re-assembled the head today, and i think that part is looking good.

however, after doing all of that i was still having issues.  after a short time through a test print i would hear a popping noise from the head followed by a dramatic drop in flow rate.  looking at the filament after stopping the print revealed that the hobbed bolt had chewed a small indent in the filament, slackening the idler and making it impossible to feed forward.

i have had better results with a different color filament that seems to be a little less soft, but i think the real variable is the idler tension.  how tight do i really want to make this thing?  everything i've seen has been pretty qualitative in describing the tension needed (tighten it until you get a ""good"" flow rate?  easy to do if you know what you're looking for, not so much if you're a noob like me).  so far i have assumed that tighter is better, so i have been nearly completely compressing the springs.  but after my testing today it is looking like that is probably a contributor to, if not the main cause, of the hobbed bolt chewing up my filament.  i set the tension much looser and so far it's looking good.

thanks again for the suggestions, so far the lulzbot community has been a big help in getting me up to speed on how to use this beast of a printer.  it says something about the quality of the hardware that even though i'm very new at this and have had several issues, the prints i have made are typically of much higher quality than other pictures i have seen posted online from people who are new at 3d printing and looking for assistance."
hexagon hot end,"i have a hexagon hot end.  re-flash was successful for higher temps.

the hexagon is about 20mm shorter than buda 2.0 and can't crank down z stop low enough to get to the print bed.  with the z stop all the way down i'm still about 10mm away from the bed.  anyone encounter this or can think of a fix?  if i put something under the bed to raise it, then the bed level adjustments won't work.","techsavvy34 wrote:you can use the 12v cartridge with a 24v power supply.  you just have to adjust the pid settings in your marlin configuration.h file to half power or you can use the config file on the lulzbot devel site.  here it is http://devel.lulzbot.com/taz/accessorie ... guration.h

solved: plastic oozing out my hot end above the heater block,"hey everyone, i just assembled my kittaz and after 2 long prints totaling about 10 hours of lulzbot green 3mm pla at 185 c, i have a pool of plastic above the heater block.  its not a very fast ooze, as this is all there was after the two prints.  

here is a picture.  what could be going wrong? isnt this a fire hazard? most importantly, how should i fix it and will it cost any $$ to fix?","while hot, you can clean the melted pla off of the heater block with a bunch of q-tips.

you will then need to disassemble the nozzle per the instructions on the lulzbot site (it needs to be warmed up and you'll need to remember to loosen the set screw), and wrap the threads with ptfe pipe thread tape (same stuff used for plumbing). 

once the nozzle is cleaned and wrapped with tape and put back together, you need to get a fan blowing on the cooling fins. this is especially important for longer prints.

i mounted a fan on the left size of the extruder, wired into the 2nd fan mount of the rambo that is set to come on automatically at 50 deg c. 

haven't had any pla oozing since wrapping the threads with ptfe and using the auxiliary fan.

sudden issue with default taz3 profile,"hey all,

i was using 0.35 and 0.5 heads for a while, and finally found a 0.5 slic3r configuration that was actually working for my taz3 (would love some defaults from lulzbot though!)

then suddenly the printer started acting up, with super low quality infills and wrapping all over. same material same configuration. in order to be sure i switched to 0.35 head and used the default slic3r profile and i am still getting the same issue. temperature does not seem to be the issue as extrusion seems to be going well on its own (outside a print).

any ideas?","since everything all of a sudden stopped working well, look at the filament path, the extruder tension and how well the extruded filament comes out the nozzle. try a simple test print to help reduce your variables."
do you unplug your power supply?,"i've noticed that my taz 4 power supply sometimes likes to turn on its fan every once in a while, even when the taz is off, and of course that it has a lovely always-on green led. the printer currently lives in my room which is why i'm very aware of these things. i'm sure it's not drawing tons of power but still i'd like to shut it off like i do my printer and other large power equipment. unplugging this big box though sometimes scares me, not for myself, but for the box brick itself. i already had one power supply fail and sometimes pulling that plug gets me a nice ""snap"" of arcing juice. so what do you guys do?",i noticed this as well so i plugged min into a power strip with a switch. this turned out convenient as i also installed led light strips on the printer and plugged them into the same power strip. now i just turn the power strip off and leave the printer on.
auto dual extruder offset calculation,"has anyone found a way to automatically calculate the dual extruder offset.  off the top of my head it would consist of a pressure sensitive plate that reads where both hot ends touch it and automatically spit out the dual extruder offset values.  anyone done this / working on this?  bueller, bueller, anyone???","not dual extruder, but related: viewtopic.php?f=18&t=860&p=4414&hilit=fsr#p4414

bed vibration when it travels y-home,when the bed is traveling in the y-home direction to bring the hot end to the front of the print it has a nasty vibration when it's just about centered over the hot end.  this recently started happening.  any ideas what's causing this?,"thanks, the bed vibration happens both during a print and when homing, but always when the bed is moving in the y-homing direction and only when the bed is near the center of the y-axis travel length.

interestingly, the second extruder (of my duel extruder) nicks the printed parts when the bed is traveling away from home (+y), but not when the bed is moving home.

so bed moving home = bed vibration, bed moving away from home = 2nd extruder nicking the build.  not sure if these two phenomena are related or not?"

taz 4 feed rate and speed,"greetings,

just got my taz yesterday yay ! long story short, i've been using a um1 at work and i decided to get myself a taz for home, for several reasons, including the bed size.

my goal was to keep using cura as i'm used to it (though i discovered interesting settings in slic3r), after 2 attempts, i got my 0.1 and 0.25 mm layer profiles right for abs, everything going all right.

i do have a few questions though : i noticed that my printing times (estimated) in cura wouldn't match what is happening on the taz, so i started to wonder about the feed rate settings and max speed in the default installed firmware.

the max acceleration seems to be the same, but i can't tell for the general acceleration, the jerk and other values as i don't have access to the um1 during the we. 

i'm printing with the same speed (well, feedrate i think) which was working for a 0.4mm nozzle. it's hard to say if the taz is having enough acceleration to reach the same speed at the end. 

printing time error are quite important. i have a current 4.5 hr estimate on a part, but it's going to be more like 6 hr from the progress bar. 

are there some settings i can change or is there something one knows in cura to adjust to the other machine ? from what i see (visually), the max speed is useless if you can't reach it, so the acceleration and jerk are the master settings there (?)

as the core of the taz is a similar firmware to than the um, the only thing i see are the settings.

side question : i see that i cannot manually change the temp with the screen above 235°c. do i have to recompile to change this ? 

finally : i'm targeting the dual extruder very soon, is there a firmware compile guide for that ?

thanks !","ok, now i've finalized everything and i'm pretty happy with what i'm doing atm.

first off, i had mentioned my issues with the stock polymer igus linear guides there
viewtopic.php?f=7&t=1316

please note that the following is now working *after* i've upgraded most axis (still have to do the z one) with hardened steel bars and ball bearing linear guides. the x carriage has been fully upgraded, the y (bed) has in one diagonal 2 plastic bearings, and on the other diagonal, 2 ball bearing guides (lmu10). the reasons is that i could (at first) perfectly align all of them and there was some constrains on the bars and bearings. now, though it's not ""absolute"", i can't see an backlash compared to what i had before. no noise neither aside a of casual tic-tac of the ball inside the bearings when they circulate in their housing.

my former goal was to get as close as possible from the um1 i have at work. not a reference per say, it's just that it has a very nice printing speed and i wanted to see if i could get the same at home with the taz, even if it has a bigger head and much more inertia.

regarding quality, i don't use 0.2 layers, i print only with 0.1mm layers. the reason is that, with a 0.35 mm nozzle, there's a max amount of plastic you can extrude at a given temp. if you want to print faster (or same speed) and thicker, you either need to increase temp (that works up to a certain limit), then plastic is too hot, you need the fan, you get warping or melting etc. or, you need to slow down to maintain the feedrate (or... use a bigger nozzle). 
i found my limit on the um1 to be 0.1 layers printed at 70 mm/s for perimeters, 50 mm/s for infils, to ensure a proper flat and gap free finish, so that was my target.

i can print with 0.2 mm layers, it's just that i need to print slower to maintain quality or you will miss plastic at some point (with identical temp). now, with the most recent settings, i'll give a shot to an identical profile except the layer thickness and see what happens. my experience is that even fir a .2 mm brim layer, it has trouble adhering as not enough plastic is coming out. using a .1 first layer then 0.2 mm layer for the rest of the part might work.

taz motion settings :
most of those are stock settings. however, i cranked up the acceleration to 2000 (um1 is 3000) as i came to realize that without the proper accel, you can't reach certain top speeds, especially during quick moves between different spots of the part, and also the part will print damn slow even if you require a printing speed of 70 mm/s : small distances will never reach the proper printing or travel speed with 500 of accel.
as a result, not reaching the proper speed can lead to oozing as well, and you get blobs on the sides and various issues.

after the head got strengthened with ball bearing guides and rebolted, i fount it's totally capable of handling that accel.
z accel was double iirc, to have a nice z hop between layers, cleaner result.

code: select allaccel 2000
vxy jerk 8
vz jerk 0.4
ve jerk 10

vmax x 400
vmax y 400
vmax z 8
vmax e 50
a max xy 4000
a max z 200
a max e 10000
a retract 3000


and just for reference, my estep : 859

printing settings. i use cura 14.09, this way i have a single software and 2 machine profiles to either print at work or at home.

key points about cura :
no fan for abs for medium to large parts, printing at 230 to 235°c with lulzbot abs (their temp requirement, which works just fine). bed at 100°c, though it will change the color of natural abs as you know, but i don't care much, and as i'm not using slurry to coat the bed, i have to crank up a bit the bed temp.

for small objects you might need to add the fan, i use min fan 25% to ensure it starts, max fan 100%, min layer time 5 seconds, and it will interpolate between 25 and 100% depending on the layer time, to avoid melting and oozing.

shell thickness : i initially though i would just use multiples of the nozzle diameter, but i found weird results in the printing time. so for instance, with 0.35 mm nozzle, i'm tempted to use a 1.05 mm shell but actually 1mm or 1.2 mm work better. experiment.

print speed : 70 mm/s best comprise so far. inill at 50 mm/s to ensure feed rate is respected and you have the proper amount of plastic applied on your top surfaces. also my abs was measured to be rather 2.81mm od, not 2.85. 
flow 105%, i've been using that density settings at work, 5-7% of shrinkage is commonly used / accepted. works for me at least.

first layer of 0.1mm now, for reasons explained above. sticks better as i'm closer to the bed. cura 14.09 has settings for an extra % on the bottom layer line width, so that you increase a bit the amount of plastic if necessary, especially if you want to use 0.2 mm for layer #1 / brim.

and... that's pretty much it. happy dance.
let me know what you think about that, with those settings, if you use cura etc.

"i printed the test octopus twice, but the layers separated.","i used the abs filament piece that was included with the printer and i used a new roll of abs filament, and the layers separated both times. is there a solution to this?


model - taz 4
filament - abs
layer thickness - .3 mm
nozzle temp - 230
bed temp - 110","there's at least 100 threads here on abs delamination issues. 

1) what software you using? slic3r? pronterface? did you use a lulzbot abs profile? 
2) how fast are you extruding? might want to attach the gcode you used. 
3) fan on or off during print?
4) printer enclosed - or open to drafts and cool air and such?
5) lulzbot abs - or some other ""brand"" of abs? 

you may want to lower bed temp. try 95c. abs shrinks when it cools. 
you may also want to change layer thickness. try something like .25mm or .20mm. see if that helps. 
make sure your fan is off for entire print."
print bed never coming up to temperature,"taz 4 can be controlled manually.  hot end and bed are showing at correct temp.  when i hit print the lcd shows bed heating... forever and the printer never starts.

i tried running the printer using repetier and watching the graphing function for the heaters.  both the hot end and bed are showing that they are up to temperature, but as soon as i hit print the output graph for the bed heater immediately indicates zero.  the temperature stays as set, the lcd screen still says the heater is on, so the heater is still powered, but the sensor that tells it it's still powered is apparently losing signal.

help!!! i can't print anything as the printer never believes it is up to temp.

any assistance is greatly appreciated.","check out this thread.  it might have the answer you're looking for.

trying out hips,"my taz is about three weeks old now and i'm getting very good and repeatable results using abs.  i am going to try out hips filament but want to check if there's anything i should know before i dive in.  specifically, should i keep separate extruders for hips and abs?  (i used the same one with abs and then pla, and then back to abs.  as a bonus i got to learn how to unclog an extruder nozzle...8v)  any other ""gotchas"" i should know about?

best regards,
paul","you should be able to switch between abs and hips at will, since they extrude at the same temperature. pull the filament out from the extruder then extrude out the new filament until the hot end is purged of the old filament."
dual extruder installation questions and documentation notes,"i started installing the taz 3 dual extruder as per the ohai documentation, and have run into a few issues. first a few that apply to my base taz 3 before i installed anything new:

 the stock heater cable for extruder 0 is extremely tight, which could cause reliability issues in the future. i recommend in the future using slightly longer cable for that. all the others seem fine.
 the ohai for the taz 3 dual extruder installation has a photo showing the connection of the thermistors.  it shows a cable with a pair of yellow wires (heated bed thermistor?) going to the top thermistor connector on the rambo, connector number 0, and a cable with a pair of orange wires (extruder 0 thermistor?) going to connector number 2.  my taz 3 wiring as supplied is the opposite, with orange going to connector 0, and yellow to connector 2.  since my taz 3 has been working, it's hard to believe that it is wired incorrectly. is the ohai photo wrong? or has this changed with newer firmware releases?  i'm reluctant to install the dual extruder wiring until i understand why my taz 3 doesn't match the photo.

other comments about the taz 3 dual extruder installation ohai docs:

 the supplied wiring harness appears to include cabling for two extruder fans, which is good, but it's not explicitly covered in the ohai doc and might confuse people.
 one of the extruder fan cables in the harness has a blue dot on both ends of the cable, and the other does not. i decided arbitrarily to use the one with the blue dot for an extruder 1 fan, but perhaps the ohai should state what's intended so that everyone does it consistently.
 the wiring polarity, or at least the color scheme, of the extruder fan cables doesn't match the ohai photo. in the photo, the red wire is on the left, and the black wire is on the right. the provided cables are the opposite. at the other end, the cables have red on pin 1 (denoted by molded triangle). what is the correct wiring?
 there is no documentation regarding connecting the ground lug. it's obvious to me, but should probably be in the documentation.

i'm really looking forward to getting this going. i've intended to print with support material from the beginning, but haven't had the time to build my own dual extruder.","3dprintdaddy wrote:hello brouhaha,
wiring harness length: if you could post a photo of your printer that would be great. my taz3 wiring harness seems to be able to print max volume without want for extra length, so i'd like to take a look at yours to compare.


it's not a matter of max print volume. the part of the stock heater cable for the first extruder is too short *inside* the electronics box. i tried taking a photo, but it's not obvious from that.  there is literally negative slack in that cable, and it's pulling on the board-mounted connector, which is likely to cause an intermittent or failure at some point in the future. this is an assembly error, as there should be a minimum of a few mm slack in all of the cables inside the box. it's possible that this only happened to my own unit. i can't pull more of that cable into the electronics box without cutting all of the cable ties binding the black first extruder wiring harness. i'll do that the next time i open the box.

ohai thermistor coupler: yes, my rambo is the same with the yellow and orange wires inverted. it may be that the photo was taken of an earlier model. installation of the second extruder is the same either way.


i don't think it's an older model. i think the photo was staged with an otherwise unwired board to make the picture clear, and it was wired wrong.

fan wiring: yes, the dual extruder comes with wiring for fans, but inasmuch as the dual extruder does not have fan mounts designed yet, we don't have instructions for how to install those fans.


i wasn't asking for fan installation instructions. the ohai indicates where to plug those connectors (though not differentiating the blue dot and non blue dot connectors), but either the ohai photograph shows the polarity (red vs black) wrong, or the supplied wiring harness is wrong.

i would guess that convention would have the dotted fan harness fan1, and the undotted fan0.


that's what i thought too, but more recently through another forum posting i found the drawing for the cable harness, and it specifies blue dot for fan 0 and no dot for fan 1.  obviously it doesn't actually matter as long as you are consistent at both ends, but given that the ohai says to connect both to the rambo, it should say which to connect to which connector, so that later when a customer buys an appropriate fan upgrade, the instructions for that can accurately state which cable at the extruder end goes to which fan.

rambo box fan question,"how often should the fan run on the rambo electronics box of the taz 4?  the fan on my printer never turns on.  do i have a bad fan or rambo board, or is this normal?

i had what appeared to me to be a heat related failure the other day, and that is when i noticed the fan was not running.  further observation over the last couple days verified the fan never runs.

any help here would be greatly appreciated.  thanks.",it should be always on.
taz 4 heated bed question,"while i don't need this info yet i am curious how one goes about removing the silicone heater from the glass, say the glass were to break or need replacing?

the reason i thought of this is that i finally committed today to a pei bed material. i have been using it clamped the the glass for some time now and it works very well with the exception that it does not lay flat everywhere so i finally used an adhesive double sided sheet that others had mentioned using and now it's on my glass permanently. 

at some point i imagine i may need to replace it and possibly the glass and i noticed that the silicone is stuck pretty good to the glass.

so, is there an official lulzbot method for removing and replacing the glass? 
if not, has anyone tried it on their own?","official method is ""buy another $75 heat bed"" unofficial method is ""start at one corner, and peal off slowly and hope for good results."
any thoughts about this delamination?,"i've had my taz 4 about two weeks.  after climbing up the learning curve quite a ways i've hit a wall.  i need to print the shaft shown in this photo.  i've achieve good adherence to the glass and a great base layer, but as it gets about 1/4 from the glass it begins to split.  experiments i've run:

enclosed unit
increased temperature of filament
honeycomb infill
90% infill
decreased layer height to .2

bed temp is 110
extrusion temp is 230 (tried 232)

any thoughts would be very helpful.  let me know if i missed anything.

thanks.","90% infill??? wow. 
have you tried 50% infill, or less? 
also, have you tried a different pattern on the infill? something other than honeycomb? rectilinear? 

also, you could try printing the infill first, then the perimeter last. there's a box you can check, or uncheck for that somewhere.

are you using the lulzbot provided profiles for abs and manually increasing the infill to 90%? 
are you using slic3r and pronterface? 

a last resort, if you have the ability to do this, would be to add ribs to outside of shaft, then turn the ribs off after you print it."
improving dimensional accuracy on taz 4,"i have had fairly good luck printing parts so far with my new taz 4, but have noticed that everything seems to be over extruding a little bit.  i'm getting good precision, the results are fairly predictable.  walls tend to be ~0.2-0.3mm thicker than designed, and holes tend to be ~0.2-0.5mm smaller than intended (worse for smaller holes).  since it's been predictable i have been able to compensate for the error in parts that i have designed, but it does limit my ability to use an existing design when i'm able to find something that meets my needs.  screw holes are the real issue!

i seem to have had the best luck running the hotend at 180 degrees and the bed at 50 degrees (default for pla).  i took several measurements of my filament (purchased at microcenter) diameter with a caliper and am using that value in slic3r.  

should i be expecting to get better dimensional accuracy?  i know this thing isn't magical so it's expected that there will be some tolerance that i have to design around.  but if there's something i can adjust that will make things better then i'd like to know how!  i've considered telling it that the filament is thicker than it is, which in theory would result in it extruding less plastic per mm of commanded extrusion, but i've never been a big fan of arbitrary fudge factors without understanding the mechanics behind the decision.  is there a more elegant way to get at it?  preferably something i could calculate based on the known over extrusion!

thanks!","you may want to further refine the extrusion calibration and slicer profile on your machine. the biggest variable that the stock profiles don't have any way of taking into account is the actual width of the filliament itself. a 3.00mm filliament is almost never exactly 3.00mm. they not only tend to vary from roll to roll, they can also vary from section to section on the same roll as much as .05mm. you will want to measure your filliament in a few places before starting a print, and take the average for the slicer filliament diameter setting. 

you can also further refine the calibration of the extruder head itself. the one from the factory should be pretty close though. here are a few guides to get you started:

i am keep playing with fan on and off, but part either become deformed, or nicly layed, but delaminates easily right away or with minor pressure applied.

it is less of a problem with parts where walls are strictly vertical, but becomes major problem when wall have some sort of curvature.

when i turn off fan at all (like it is recommended everywhere for abs plastic), edges of part lift a bit getting in a way of extruder and as a result would either become damaged (if speed is high) or just become super deformed (if speed is slow.) you can see how edge of the part raises in video below:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfzwec_6ae8 (it is printing it slowly in this video, but if i raise speed - it would actually tear away some pieces of the part edge)

when i am using fan and set it to 100% max, it would lay down much nicer layers, and i see raising edge effect rarely, but then part delaminates while still on printing bed and in overall not strong.

i am attaching stl file of part i am trying to print. any ideas of what i should look for to get nice print for this particular part?

i tried too many combinations of settings so far, but the one in the video is ""medium abs"" settings file from lulzbot website with speed adjusted with knob on the printer down to 50%","for lifting, you can try the abs slurry trick, which works well. you can also try printing with a 5-7mm brim layer to get better adhesion. you may also be slightly too high on your first layer. 

if you seem to have good adhesion at first and then it lifts off later, you may be encountering abs heat warp. abs tends to cool unevenly, and contract when it does so. if you are attempting to print in an unconditioned space during the winter, it will cause parts to lift pretty easily. the easiest countermeasures for that problem are building some sort of heat trapping enclosure box around the printer (a large cardboard box works well for this if you keep it away from the heat sources due to the whole cardboard being flammable thing)  

have you ran through the calibration gcode file and made sure your bed is completely level?"
new taz4 printer weird extrusion noise when printing slowly,"another issue i have i am a bit worried about is noise i am getting sometimes when extrusion happens slowly. you can hear it this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px8mgu8r6ne

also extrusion gears have some amount of plastic dust on them - i wonder if this is normal or something missaligned or misstighted somewhere.","sounds like you are getting a bit of filament grinding. i'd try tightening the extruder latch springs a bit. if the extruder tries to push more plastic than the model has space for, it can gouge the filliament and cause some dust like that."
y axis skips during very long print,"hi everyone,

i've been running a very long print, ~20 hours, in pla, and after a few computer related failures (a windows update and a crash) i had a successful print of the entire part, however there are three large skips in the y-axis of the print about 2/3rds of the way through. this print is from an sd card, so the skips can't be due to a computer issue. i'm trying to figure out what the cause of these could be so i can fix it.

i've looked at the x and y belts, and the tension is identical and doesn't appear to be too loose. i can't see any rubbing of the belts on any parts of the printer, and the x and y motion is smooth when i push the bed and carriage by hand. the skips are 10, 4 and 8mm in the y direction, respectively, and at 3 and 2.5mm spacings in the z direction, and seem to occur at a single layer, not gradually.



 printed part and layer alignment 




 close up of layer skips 


could this be an issue with motor drivers overheating, or an interrupted power supply? i can't identify any mechanical issues that would be causing this, especially ones that would allow the print to continue after the print. anyone have any similar issues?","your y belt is probably too lose for that much mass and skipped, or the pulley set screw has backed out on the y axis pulley. i'd install a belt tensioner module and tighten the pulley."
chunky printing in perimeters and infill,"i'm starting to see some issues with a few prints. specifically when i slow down the print or print small features. the perimeters and infill get a little chunky. i've attached a photo to illustrate what i'm seeing (posting more tomorrow when i can). i have a hunch it has to do with heat creep. i stumbled upon the post with a fan shroud that blows air on the budaschnozzle. can anyone confirm that this is the issue and the improved fan shroud design will help?

thank you!","slicer settings:
layer height: 0.1mm
infill: 70% (normally don't go this high)
infill threshold: 120 (this one i usually don't adjust. i was experimenting because there were small features in the part)
speeds: all 30 or less
default extrusion width: 0.125 mm
fan speeds: min 0, max 65

attached is another example of what i'm seeing, but the settings are different."
looking for reassurance,"so about a year ago i purchased a solidoodle 3 printer.  after some months of fooling around with it i was able to produce some marginally acceptable parts.  i also had to adjust my definition of what ""acceptable"" was.  a week ago today the extruder became very inconsistent, rendering the printer unusable.  

i got a 3d printer because i just wanted to make some simple plastic parts; i really wasn't looking to get into a relationship. 

i spent a few hours trying to repair and then decided to search around for a better printer.  long story short is that i wound up at the lulzbot site.  ordered a taz 4 on friday.  my second choice was the ultimaker 2.   multiple and interesting print materials, plus the ability to upgrade were big drivers in picking the taz, but i think the biggest one was that this printer seems to have evolved from earlier models.  my guess, and hope, is that this implies a somewhat mature design that is fundamentally a good and reliable one.

although i should have done this *before* ordering, i would really appreciate it if some of you folks on this list could tell me that i've made a good decision and that it is unlikely i'll have to spend hours upon hours doing calibrations and fixes and re-calibrations and re-calibrations. 

best regards,
paul","hello paul,
i have a taz 3, and i think you've made a great decision. the fact that you've reached out to the forum here is a good start. i've spent a lot of time reading through forum threads, and i've learned a lot from the many smart, experienced, and determined users here.

but  your first real steps will be with the lulzbot unpacking and quick start guide, and then the user manual. even though i was anxious to print, i followed these guides very carefully when i was getting started, and the great documentation helped me to understand the printer, to properly prepare it for printing, and to avoid making some serious mistakes.

after the formal documentation, this forum is a valuable resource. read through it, and  you'll discover a lot of tips and learn from others' experiences. for example, if you'll be doing a lot of pla printing, you might want to consider the alternative fan shroud design in this thread viewtopic.php?f=36&t=983 which gave me greatly improved success in printing pla.

additionally, your taz is backed by a knowledgeable team at aleph objects. one of the first pieces of advice i received was to avoid some potential problems by using quality filaments, and i still live by that. also i've had to contact support for a few technical issues, and they have always been responsive, quickly resolving an issue in one case, and providing useful suggestions and advice in another case.

i don't know exactly what your issues were with the other printer (and i've never used a 3d printer other than my taz) but i was making some nice quality prints immediately after setting mine up. as i progressed to some challenges of more complicated parts, i was able to get some tips from the forum, as well as do a bit of experimentation on my own to improve a few print quality issues. but the important thing is that the taz is a solid, robust design, which is an important starting point for you. if you do need to make some tweaks and improvements for your particular needs, it's made easier by the community here on the forum, lulzbot support, and the open source reprap community in general."
taz 4 print quality advice?,"hi, i live in chicago and our chicago public library makerlab (http://www.chipublib.org/maker-lab/) has a lulzbot taz 4.  i stopped by yesterday to find they are still having print quality issues since it was first setup in july.

here's photos i took yesterday of prints and settings:
https://plus.google.com/photos/+drewfus ... 1304855089

they told me the best they have been able to do is the soldier head model.  the green model was printed on their taz 4.  the yellow was printed their makerbot replicator 2.

any suggestions?

thanks,
drew

pdp7pdp7 _at_ gmail com","lowering the print layer height will assist with improving quality of overhangs, which that piece has a lot of.  if they're using lulzbot slic3r settings, they're not getting as fine detail as possible.  layer height can go down to .06.  also, make sure the fan is on.  when i started, i made the mistake of putting the printer on a table and unknowingly had the rear feet hanging off the table, this made the unit wobble sometimes and messed up whatever i was printing.

hope this helps."
"taz4 abs prints lumpy, wavy, bumpy!","newbie here...i apologize if i haven't searched hard enough, but wanted to ask, anyone seeing wavy, lumpy prints with abs?

i have a taz4, nozzle at 230c, bed at 85c, fan not running, ic3d abs filament, 2.89mm diameter. when printing what resembles a 3mm thick compact disc, the solid layers always end up wavy. the infill layers are perfect/flawless, but solid layers are like a wavy potato chip.

ideas?

thanks!","2 things that i know of that cause this exact thing. one is putting setting the filament diameter higher than it actually is, measure it accurately in several spots. next is having the nozzle to close to the heated bed. yes, getting it close with abs makes for better adhesion but then it will sort of lay out lines that are hit and mis and the next layer lays over these and are wavy, it goes away with taller items and when there is infill. so, if your'e sure the filament is entered at the right size, then adjust your z axis up a hair at a time until it goes away.

the smaller the nozzle, the more accurate the z axis must be."
can't print from sd card,"so i am having trouble printing from an sd card. i can get to the point where it heats up both the nozzle and the bed but refuses to do anything else.

at first i thought it was the naming then i thought maybe it was due to the bed only getting to 84c when it's set to 85c but if i wait long enough the display says 85c. 

the bottom of the screen says heating done but nothing else happens.

i have printed the same files using repetier host from my machine but some of these prints are 8-15 hours long and i want to use the computer. i was just 4 hours into a 5 hour print and needed to print a label and when i had to unplug the usb on my label printer (it sometimes forgets it's attached) my taz 4 went offline and ruined the print.

the file i am printing is a bit over 6mb in size, does that matter? if not why won't it start?","there are two ways you can set a 3d printer nozzle and bed temperature. from the gcode file, or from the printer control interface. if you have tinkered with your slic3r profile and added the temperatures in there, say 230c for the nozzle and 85c for the bed for a taz, then the printer will not print until it is at exactly 230.00 for the nozzle, and exactly 85.00 for the bed. not 229.99 and 85.00, not 230.00 and 84.99, they have to both be spot on exact to start. 

what happens is that you end up chasing the temperature range. the nozzle heats up and automatically starts to cool as it nears temperature. if the bed is not yet caught up and at that temperature, it can be difficult to keep the hot end at the exact temperature it needs to start. a .01 degree fluctuation is pretty much normal and expected. that coupled with the slowdown once the bed nears its target temperature can cause it to literally take 45 minutes after both temperatures are ""near"" their final reading before the printer will actually print. 

my reccommendation would be to strip those temperatures out of your slic3r profile entirely. you can try printing the existing lulzbot bed calibration gcode to see if that is the issue. if that print starts instantly when you hit the print button, then you know its that pesky temperature settings."

x-carriage freecad or step file needed,"i would like to modify the taz 4 x-carriage and would need either a freecad model or a step file of the latest x-carriage found here:

can someone please post a freecad or step file for me?

thanks, ross","piercet - thanks for the help and posting this, but it still doesn't work for me.  i can modify the file now in my cad software, but then it doesn't allow me to output the modified back to a stl file to print.  evidently, i still need the original step or any other original cad file that i can bring into creo for modification.

"taz 4 stopped extruding, now it's broken","yesterday, my taz4 just stopped extruding. (this is with abs, only thing i've run in the machine.)
i was printing some parts and somewhere along the way the printer stopped extruding. it thought it was but it wasn't.
i tried to manually extrude and the gear turned but no filament came out. the temp says the extruder is at 230.
i pulled out the filament and it looks like the hobbled bolt had carved into it. i cut that piece out and tried to route new filament but it won't cause any filament to come out the bottom.
it looks like i can push the filament to about the bottom of the wooden piece but no further. when i pull it back up again the tip is melted.

so, i tried removing the nozzle as per the instructions in the manual: heat to 160, turn off, pliers on heater, use 13mm wrench to turn. i couldn't grip the heater so i removed the extruder assy and tried again. the nozzle broke off the aluminum tube.

while i wait to hear back from their product support group, why didn't the nozzle just unscrew like it was supposed to? almost looks like there is melted teflon tape, or something like that, burnt around the threads. and what could have caused it to jam/clog in the first place, in the middle of a print?

i really love this printer but i hope i don't have to do this every 5 weeks...









","i had exactly same symptoms on my new taz4.  just stopped extruding after about 15 hours of use.  filament feed seemed to turn but no extrusion.   using the .35mm nozzle.  tried to unscrew the nozzle following manual's description.  unsuccessful.  didn't want to apply too much torque while hot end was mounted so i also tried by pulling hot end assembly off.  then noticed the nozzle was at a slight angle (i.e. not completely vertical).  leads me to believe nozzle was cross-threaded.  wonder if this contributed to blockage.  anyway, new hot end is on order.  this time, i'll check nozzle installfirst  will also apply high temp antiseize prior to mounting hot end to printer.

i still have old unusable hotend unit.  i am sure if i apply enough force, nozzle will crack as in the original post."

lock washer retrofit,"lulzboters,
on a recent print we ran into the issue of the extruder head mounting bracket disconnecting itself from the overall larger extruder assembly. the object we were printing had some thin sections that required the extruder head to move back and forth very rapidly. over time this giggling caused the two screws that hold the aluminum extruder mounting plate to unscrew because they are mounted upside-down. this created a pretty amazing fluffball of extruded plastic!

to fix this, we just used 2 lock washers on these screws and have not had any problems since. if you are running into issues with the components in the extruder unscrewing on parts that include a lot of fast direction changes, this might be something to try.   

also, might be something to include in the next version of the printer ",glad to hear that you identified the cause of your loose hot end! it's a good idea to periodically look over the printer to make sure that the belts and screws are tight and everything's moving appropriately.
"taz 4 not printing properly, help!","we recently purchased a taz 4 printer, but have been running into a number of issues.  initially we ran into a few hiccups, namely the nozzle wasn't assembled properly and clogged, the firmware was corrupt and needed to be re-flashed, and the axes were a little loose/wobbly.  

even after fixing all these issues, however, we are still unable to get usable prints due to corners curling up and general abs warping.  we have tried a number of different fixes: re-zeroed the hot end, re-leveled the bed, tried various bed temps ranging from 90-110c, tried using a brim, used various adhesion layers ranging from hairspray on glass to kapton/abs slurry to pei, created an enclosure to eliminate possible drafts, even used a thermocouple and heat lamp to keep the inside area at a constant 38c.  what is the most confusing to me is that my coworker has the exact same printer sitting on his coffee table in front of a partially open window and it prints the exact same gcode with no issues and no special adhesion layers.

we are really unsure what to look for in terms of why this printer isn't working properly, so any advice would be greatly appreciated.","i have had my taz for about a year. initially, i was dead set on printing abs and have been doing so all along. i have had various problems but currently, my abs prints are fantastic, except for the warping and splitting. to be honest, i have decided that is just the nature of abs. some part geometries will warp, no matter what you do. i have an enclosure as well.

recently, i have been printing with pla. what can i say, if you don't need a specific abs material property like resistance to heat or a little more flexibility, pla is awesome. the parts are accurate, flat and rigid... and not one split or crack. printing cookie cutters drove me to pla because it is perfect for that, but i am going to be printing more things with it to give it a good test on general parts.

i am not saying you don't have some specific issues to work through but it might just be a fact of life for the part you are trying to build. posting some pictures will help the forum help you.

taz 4 power supply broken,"i received my taz 4 last night and was having a blast getting it set up until i took a close look at the power supply.  the voltage select switch seemed to be missing, with a sticker clearly indicating the intended purpose of the hole in the plastic case.  after shaking the unit, i noticed a piece was loose inside: the switch.  since i'm pretty sure its not a wireless switch i decided it would be best not to energize the supply.  so my taz is sitting dormant on the table, sad and powerless.

i sent an email to lulzbot support last night.  does anyone have any experience with this sort of issue or any general thoughts on how fast of a turnaround i should expect from support?  this looks like a well built machine, it's a shame that the whole thing comes tumbling down at the mercy of some cheap chinese power supply.

one of the reasons i decided to go with lulzbot was that everyone gave their support high praise.  hopefully that faith will be rewarded.","hello ogreb,

rust on z axis screws?,"hey all,

any suggestions for dealing with rust on the z axis screws? our poor taz 4 has the unfortunate luck of running in a very tropical area (the arecibo observatory, on the lovely island of puerto rico), and although it is housed in a building with ac and hasn't been exposed to the elements at all, it has begun to develop some rust on the z screws. the areas coated by the white grease has only developed a light rust coating, but the areas which are uncovered have developed a flaky coating. 

also, any recommendations on where to source replacements? does lulzbot sell them? i couldn't find them in the store.

taz 4 dual extruder,"i installed the marlin dual extruder software and a dual extruder on my taz 4.  my first extruder motor (e0) is fine, but my second extruder motor (e1) has constant current running to it even when it is not extruding.  this is causing the motor to always run very hot.

we are thinking this is a defective rambo board, but i'm open to suggestion (could it be firmware related?).  has anyone else had this problem?","when i boot up the taz 4 (without filament in the extruders) i cannot spin extruder motor e1 by hand because the current it starts getting at boot up locks up the motor; however extruder motor e0 is fine at boot up such that i can spin that motor freely.  after about 5 minutes, due to the constant current being sent to motor e1, it starts getting extremely hot.

also, just to try something, do you know what gcode command to send in pronterface to turn off extruder motor e1 (the second extruder)?  fyi, when i tried to extrude using software commands with motor e1 it would not turn, possibly due to the current running through it which might all be related to a defective rambo board which would be a shame because my taz 4 is brand new."

general help with taz 4,"hello,
i am new to 3d printing and bought a taz4 for my school to use. i have so far been pretty unsuccessful. i did finally get a sucessful ocotpus last friday though!! my prints will start out ok but fail quickly. one problem is that the filament is getting stipped by the hobbed bolt. the question i have right now is that when i extrude filament from a height of 40-50 mm the extrusion doesn't go straight down but instead will often begin to curl up and stick to the nozzle. i think this is part of my printing problem. shouldn't the extrusion drop straight down? if it is, what is causing mine to curl out and what can i do about it?
thanks
jpcubed","that curling is normal. it's the outer layer of the extruded bit cooling faster than the inside, causing it to contract in one direction or another. that should have no impact at all on printing. 
you should not be seeing filliament stripping right away. there are several causes of that that you may need to adjust for. 

1. nozzle pressure. if you are too close to the bed at start, or if you don't have the filliament diameter set properly, you can end up extruding too much filliament which will eventually back up the nozzle, causing a blockage that causes the filliament to stop feeding and then strip out. you should take a look at the user manual for the taz 4, and run the bed calibration gcode until the starting layer looks like the ""proper bed adhesion"" picture. make sure all the corners are level and calibrated properly across the entire pass, etc.

next, check your diameter of filliament with a good set of digital calipers. a 3.00mm filliament is not always 3.00mm. most common sizes seem to be 2.85mm or 3.12mm actual diameter that i see anyways. the hot end will accomodate those other sizes just fine mechanically, but the slicer settings itself need to be adjusted so that you are actually extruding the amount of plastic you think you are. if the settings are currently set to 3.00mm and you actually are feeding 3.12mm, the back pressure will build up quickly and cause the filliament to block and then strip out. adjust the filliament settings in slic3r accordingly.

finally, check the hobbed bolt chamber itself. you should remove any loose shavings, clean any plastic out of the teeth of the hobbed bolt itself, remove any other residue, then set the spring tension according to the manual. too tight can cause filliament stripping, though it can also just show signs of the back pressure problem sooner than a loose bolt would

2. electrical. it is possible that your heater cartridge or thermistor are not working properly. that is rare, but can happen with these devices. if checking out the nozzle pressure settings does not fix the issue, you may want to grab an inexpensive point and shoot infrared thermometer and check that the heat settings match the actual heat output. for abs the nozzle should be around 230 degrees c. the bed should be 85c"

lighting a 24 volt taz 3.2,"i'm making progress on the upgrades to my taz and decided to go ahead and stick the lighting module on there, that's when i discovered the enclosure fan, which is what i had initially planned to tap into for power since it's always on anyways, is 24 volt. 24 volt led strips seem to be very rare and very expensive, so i'd like to stick with a 12 volt lighting system. it looks like converter boxes exist to go from 24 to 12, but i was wondering if the rambo board has a built in 12v power lead that i don't know about?  

any ideas?","you are almost certainly seeing 24 or 12v being pwm. most multimeters have an input capacitence that makes high frequency signals appear as a steady voltage. the pwm frequnecy is probably on the order of 10khz. i would be mildly concerned about a few things:

agreed,  the x axis already has significant droop in the center compared to the edges that will get worse with an increased length.

that's my next area i am working on.  1 lightening the x cartage by moving the extruder and looking at trying makerslide with a skate and see if that sags less at the current width.

i'm looking for a flatter bed not wider but any improvement in flatness would increase the longer width w/o increasing the sage of the current 2 rod system.

misaligned layers,"after roughly 150 hours of use, the prints from my taz4 have developed misaligned/sheared/lopsided layers. according to my research it may be due to skipping steps, which can be caused by potentiometer settings, belt tension, or loose set screw on the pulley or not on the stepper shaft.

best way to align z axis on a taz?,"i'm sure this must be documented somewhere.  because there are 2 motors and 1 could be turned without the other when the power isn't on.  

what is the best way to align or check the alignment of the z axis?

certainly, you could adjust the bed leveling to account for an offset in one side or the other, but i'd prefer to be square to start with.

can the shipping tabs be used, is there a reference point that can be used to adjust both motors to create a square relationship to *something* with the z axis?

also while on this topic... i've noticed that when the z axis is down close to the bed that there is a tendency for the screw shafts on the z motors to have not be straight.  let me explain.  when you home if you have the z axis up off the bed a good ways, you'll see at the tip of the threaded rod, that it will not be straight as it turns, it will have a wobble to it this wobble is much more pronounced when the head is down towards the bed, and less pronounced when it's up off the bed.  as you might image, the threaded part that is tracking that rod is dampening the wobble the closer it gets to the end.  i would expect that this wobble will show as a slight offset in the x or y axis as the z axis moved up and down... 

to see this, all you have to do is home the z axis, then watch the tip of the threaded rod on both sides and move the z axis via rapid movements up a few inches and then hit the home z again... you'll immediately see what i'm talking about.

maybe i'm just used to .00001"" tolerances on cnc equipment as those equipment have support on both ends of any threaded movement devices.

anyway, figured i'd ask.
alan","i had a similar issue with the right z motor.   place a finger on the motor durring a print when the z is holding.   i was feeling a very slight pulse on the rignt side.  i was able to print to an extent, but had to re adjust the right side after each print as it would be high.

after quadruple checking alignment of frame and axis (i had upgraded to lead screws on my taz 3.1)  support suggested some beta firmware.   i was able to get rid of that pulse and the drift went away,  

see if you can feel this pulse,   turn off any auto leveling and run a quick print .   the pulsing would start maybe 3/4 the way through the first layer.   i could only feel it and didn't hear any slipping.

i am running http://devel.lulzbot.com/taz/holly/software/ 

changed the 
default_axis_steps_per_unit and default_e1_steps_per_unit to my settings my extruder rate.   its different for each printer.   document it before doing the upload.  default is 800. 


 also changed these to completely rid the issue on my machine.   these may only be necessary on my upgraded machine vs a stock 4.0 

ymmv

in configuration_adv.h  

#define microstep_modes {16,16,4,16,16}     //  changed 16 to 4 for the z microsteps

#define digipot_motor_current {175,175,225,135,135} //  changed the current for the z motors from 240 to 225.
i stepped it down 5 at a time till i could not feel any pulses on teh motors.

also changed the configuration.h  only change it to match the microstepping if you changed it above.
 #define default_axis_steps_per_unit   {100.5,100.5,400,976.4}  // changed z to 400 to match the microsteps.

also changed in configuration.h
#define default_max_feedrate          {800, 800, 6, 50} //  changed the 8 to a 6

"taz 4 adhesion problems and ""wait for user"" on lcd screen","we recently received a brand-new taz 4 at work (most of our 3d printers are makerbot replicator 2 machines) and i'm having a lot of problems with it. i'm printing in 3mm pla and when we print, the extruded filament sticks to the nozzle and creates a ""snotball"" that just builds up around the nozzle. on the rare occasion that i can actually get a usable outline from it, the fill comes out very badly. i've tried putting glue stick or painter's tape on the print bed's pet film, but the results are always the same. i'm using the recommended slic3r settings for pla (fast/low quality, no supports).

i'm also having problems printing from the sd card. when i put a .gcode file on the sd card and try to print from it, i get a ""wait for user..."" message on the lcd that i can't seem to get around. (clicking the wheel/button on the lcd just takes me back to the menu.) the only reference i could find to ""wait for user"" was in the marlin_main.cpp source code (under the ""#ifdef ultipanel"" declaration).

what am i doing wrong here? i'm doing everything by the book that i can think of.","the extrusion problem is the first thing to address.   you should be able to raise the z axis to around 50mm and extrude (i use 100mm) and get a nice round coil of plastic thread.   if that's not happening and still getting a snotball.  then nozzle is clogged or temp too low for that pla.  i use cheap pla and have to extrude at 200c   that well above the factory recomendation.   one brand i cook it at 205.

as to adhesion...   check out this thread.  viewtopic.php?f=7&t=1019   people have had huge success with various thicknesses and mounting from tape to clips.   personally,  i have a 1/8"" sheat ordered from amazon held to the bare glass plate (i assume it will work over the klapton as well) with 5 3/4"" strips of transfer tape also ordered from amazon.   after bed leveling i have had no issues with adhesion or warpage.

there should be a list of things to print when the printer is new.  all the gcode is on the sd card and for a new user,  like i was, it would be great to have been instructed to print a few replacement parts as the first print.   alot like creating a restore disc when opening a new pc these days.

things i would print as a new printer owner:

extruder gear set.
extruder latch (the part with the bearing)

those two are the only parts i have broken under regular use.

after rebuilding the x axis many times evolving to a lead screw system i cracked a belt tentioner and had to replace the x carrage.  was able to clamp the old one well enough to print a new one.   but that was totaly my fault.  i guess teh takeaway on this one is if your going to play upgrade,   print anything you have to adjust or move, disconnect before disassembly,   that is unless of course you have another printer to print the parts on  "

just curious, where did you get this stl for the mirrored curved fan duct?

extruder hitting lower layer(s),"hello,
i was printing with natural color abs and all was well.
i switched to black abs and now the extruder is hitting and dragging across the lower layers.
i printed with black before when i first got the taz a month ago and i think i may have had this problem then as well.
bed height is calibrated okay, what do i need to change to get the black to extrude correctly? i tried lowering the heat 5 degrees and raising it 5 degrees from a base of 230 and no difference. wondering if i need to set the ""extrusion multiplier"" to a lower number? it's at 1 now. i'm printing with .22 layer height and a .3 first layer with a filament diameter of 2.88. (i only use lulzbot filament.)
here are a couple pictures but they are fuzzy as the printer was printing at the time. the white line is the extruder drag. the gouge in the skinny pieces is pretty pronounced/deep in those corners. it also seems like i can see the extruder assembly physically get pushed up as it crosses across the print, but that may just be my eyes playing tricks on me. but in any case i can't imagine that's good for it...
any ideas would be most welcome?
ps: if this should be in the filament section please feel free to move it.









","i changed the extrusion multiplier to 0.95 and i didn't see much of a change...
however, i just checked the filament diameter, i'm about the middle of the roll (1kg) now i think, and it's dia is now 2.92. when i started it was 2.88 and that's what i have in slic3r. that seems like it would cause a lot more stuff to squirt out. 
the filament isn't nearly as uniform as i thought it would be through the roll.
how often should i be checking the dia? this is with lulzbot abs.
when i wasn't using this roll it was in a sealed plastic bin with desiccant so i don't think it's moisture expansion....

okay, so rounding up from 11.7, 10.8 and 9.8 to 12, 11 and 10 respectively would be a little... generous. but i'm completely perplexed on how you go from 10.8 to 12 inches. this was also quoted to me in sales emails (no reply on my email asking about it yet).","jepmn wrote:thanks, folks. it's still a great build volume but i have to admit i got a bit pumped up over the thoughts of 12x12. i have a project where i'm printing widgets that are 11.5 x 11.5 and 12x12 would have been a godsend to avoid having to piece the widgets together after the fact (and thus have to limit my designs). but i expect unless i find another machine i can afford that has this desired build volume and fits in my budget and had everything i was digging with the taz, i'll come back.

i apologize again about the confusion over build volume and fully recognize why that matters for your application. 

all lulzbot products are fully libre/open source hardware, so you could upgrade it to a larger bed on your own if you wanted to! the full bill of materials for the printer is available here: http://download.lulzbot.com/taz/4.0/pro ... -guava.ods.

by identifying the relevant parts, you can contact the suppliers and purchase the upgraded parts to expand the machine. we have a customer about to undergo upgrading their 2 taz printers to 24""x24"" print beds  here are the assembly instructions for the standard machine that you could use for reference: http://ohai-kit.alephobjects.com/group/guava/.
jepmn wrote:another question if you have the time: one of the ""must haves"" on my list is dual extruders (i want to do some multicolor stuff and some stuff where the ability to print supports in pva/hips would be handy). the sales person i talked to said that a plug-and-play dual extruder was in the works and would be released ""soon"". any idea about when ""soon"" is at this point (or when it isn't)? not to cast any sort of doubt on a company that looks quite lovely from what i've seen, but i've been burned so many times in the past with hardware and software promising extended capabilities that never come that i just can't let myself believe it until i can actually see it on the shelf, so to speak.

dual extruder release is right around the corner! as we show in the taz product announcement video (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6olcxv9ami), the electronics are equipped and ready for a dual extruder.

we are currently testing thinner motors (that allow for a smaller profile dual extruder, thereby maximizing the print area because when coupling two extruders onto the carriage there is some sacrifice on build area that we are trying to minimize as much as possible). once the motors pass testing, we'll be shipping the dual extruders out the door! we are aiming for within the next month, but we have to put them through the wringer first. 

the first dual extruder will come equipped with two of our standard budaschnozzles. you can see all the development files on our site here: http://devel.lulzbot.com/taz/accessorie ... ruder-1.0/. photos of the assembly process (including final product) are available here: http://devel.lulzbot.com/taz/accessorie ... /assembly/.

here's one illustrative side angle shot:

http://devel.lulzbot.com/taz/accessorie ... g_0236.jpg

with this dual extruder you will be able to print with traditional plastics like pla and abs, then use hips as support material as you mentioned. or, if you don't want to wait, you can use the source files to make your own! several people on the forum have done this  follow progress on the product's development here: http://forum.lulzbot.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=450.

sample prints below:

http://devel.lulzbot.com/taz/accessorie ... _fox_2.jpg
http://devel.lulzbot.com/taz/accessorie ... globe3.jpg

later this summer we'll be introducing the dual extruder with a flexystruder. you can see the development files for this product on our site here: http://devel.lulzbot.com/taz/accessorie ... r_w_flexy/. with this product you will be able to print with traditional plastics like pla and abs and use a flexible filament like pva for support, or you could create products that fuse strong flexible filaments like ninjaflex with hard filaments like abs.

sample print (ninjaflex blue inside, abs black outside) below:

http://devel.lulzbot.com/taz/accessorie ... fill_2.jpg

(btw, we completed this print and ran over the golf ball-type printed item with a forklift and it survived. the abs shattered but bonded so tightly with the ninjaflex that the item maintained its physical integrity... pretty crazy.)

then after that, we'll be introducing a dual extruder equipped with two flexystruders... after that, who knows? muwahaha   

seriously though, hope this is informative!

pla jamming on taz 4,"hi guys,

i realise that there are already a few topics about pla jamming due to heat creep and so on, but as i read through them, most of them were resolved by mounting a fan, but i have a taz 4 with a fan already on it stock and the prints are still clogging, which results in the filament grinding on the extruder and not moving on. even printing at 185°c creates these problems, could increasing the temp (and consequently lowering viscosity) help? does anyone else have these kind of problems on a taz 4?
i've been toying with cooling settings in slic3r and using settings as recommended in other posts but it still jams.

(using blue pla bought from lulzbot, just in case it's relevant)","i had a few more jams with pla, so i pulled the extruder apart again. the internal diameter of the ptfe tube seems to be plenty big enough. i also noticed that once the end of the filament exits the other end of the tube, it feeds very smoothly. 

i installed the new fan shroud/duct described in this thread:
http://forum.lulzbot.com/viewtopic.php?f=36&t=983
and that seems to have taken care of the problem. now i can use these pla filaments to print at even very low feed rates. i left some more details in that thread.

i highly recommend to ao that you check out this design and consider using it for the taz fan kit."
x axis now running in reverse direction,"doing a z upgrade on my taz 3.1,  got everything in place however my x axisis running in opposite direction.

all i did with thex axis wiring was un plug the motor, un mount it from old x end and mount it in the new and plugged it back in.   only wiring was to create a new z end stop harnes to make it longer,  no firmware changed yet,   now real sure how this can be.","easiest thing to do would be to switch the wires on the x and y axis, at the board, to see if the problem switches to the new axis (look into the board connector or the mosfet/stepper driver on that axis), or if the problem remains on the x (x stepper motor or x wiring). 

the stepper motor has two wire pairs, they are: black & green and red & blue. the resistances of each wire pair should be between ~2.5 and ~3.2 ohm.

sometimes the endstops can cause weird axis movement, so use the m119 command in the pronterface terminal window to check the current endstop status. send the command twice for each axis, once while open and once while activated.

if you'd like more assistance, please feel free to send in a message to support@lulzbot.com, with your order number, serial number, contact information and shipping address."
taz 4 1.75mm filament q,"i'm becoming a new owner of a taz4, and i'm looking to use 1.75mm filaments.  i have seen posts that i need to install the adapter into the nozzle, but what i can't find is what the default nozzle is on the taz4.  it's unclear to me if it is running a budaschnozzle 2.0, 1.1, or 1.0 out of the box.  i hope someone who knows the taz4 can help.","the taz 4 comes with a buddaschnozzle 2.0c out of the box. the 1.x variants were only found on the older ao-10x series printers.  

the adaptor is basically just a tube with a narrower passage that goes into the hot end. here is the assembly guide:

taz wiring diagram,"hello,

taz 3 y axis trigger don't stop the motor,"hello,

i'm encountering a very annoying problem.

when i click on y home button with pronterface the tray does not stop when it reaches the end and try to force to step forward.

do you have any idea to fix this ?

regards","if you are connected with pronterface, type m119 into the command input line. it should display the status of the endstop. trigger it manually and then run it again. it should switch from open to triggered. if it does not, then you should take a look at the wiring and make sure that the endstop is plugged in right. also, make sure your bed wires are not getting in the way of the bed traveling to the back of the y-chassis.

you can swap the x-endstop connector with the y-endstop connector and run the same m119 test to test if it is the board or if it is the harness/switch that is the problem.

best of luck, let us know if this doesn't resolve the problem."
finding budaschnozzle version,"hi,
where i work we have a taz purchased...probably sometime last year. i don't know the exact order date, or where / whether the original paperwork got saved. i'm looking to stock a couple replacement nozzles, but there are currently 3 incompatible series. is there an easy or reliable way to tell which budaschnozzle version the printer has? 
thanks!","if your budaschnozzle has a copper heat sink it's more than likely a budaschnozzle 1.x series.

stepper moror is very hot!,"i got my taz 4 this monday and i've had fun with various prints. however, i've noticed that the the x-axis, y-axis, and extruder stepper motors are very hot. using the bed temperature as a guideline, the motors are around 100 f. is this normal? when turning the motor manually with the gears, there seems to be places on the gears that require more torque to spin, as if the gears aren't 100% matched and/or oblong.  

please help.","it's normal for the extruder stepper motor to get warm, and for the x and y axis steppers to do the same when printing quickly. what speeds are you running when you encounter this? we use the same firmware across the entire line, so your 3d printer has the same power settings."
fan lowering hot end temp,"i have a taz 2.1 and i am having a problem where when the fan comes on as part of the cooling cycle, it lowers the temperature of the hot end.  it was such a fluctuation in temperature that it would get to the point were the filament would not be hot enough to extrude and it would strip out the filament.  a couple of months ago, i convinced my work to buy a taz 4 which doesn't seem to have nearly as bad of a problem with the temperature swings.  i thought to myself, this must be a result of the new 24 volt system.  so i ordered the 24 volt upgrade for my taz 2.1 and got it all hooked up and reflashed the firmware, everything seem to be working (except for an occational blank screen when i turn on the machine which i also get with the taz 4, after i turn on and off couple of times it comes on, i did't check the cable connection) anyway back to the upgraded taz 2.1, it is alot better that before, but i did have a temp swing printing abs from 230 to 193, which is very close to a failed printed i quickly sent a m106 s0 which has been my failsafe.  i'm thinking also even it the print doesn't fail, these temperature swings surely affect the layer adhesion which could be another problem people are having with layer adhesion, if a constant temperature can't be maintained.  i read another post about tweaking the pid settings, is there something that could be done to maintain a more stable hot end temperature with the fan blowing a variable speeds through out the build.  i would appreciate any feedback or suggestions or anyone else noticing a similar situation.
thanks,
mark","you can limit the fan speed in slic3r or your preferred slicing engine. the setting can be found at: slic3r > filament settings > cooling > fan settings > fan speed max: and set it to 66%, save and regenerate your gcode file. feel free to adjust the fan speed max percentage setting if you need a bit more cooling.

taz-4 - won't power on,"my taz-4 machine lost power suddenly when i was removing the nozzle for cleaning.  i had left the heatend on at 100c to soften the pla so i could unscrew the nozzle.  i noticed that during the removal of the nozzle, the machine lost power.  after cleaning the nozzle and screwing it back in, i noticed that the machine no longer powers on.

i am getting power to the converter box (green light on) but i have not checked if the machine is receiving power.  could i have blown out some wiring and fried the board?  the machine is only a  week old!","you may have blown a fuse on the rambo board. there are three fuses, the large blue automotive type fuse, and the two rectangular polyfuses. they can be found here: http://reprap.org/wiki/rambo_v1.2#fuses use a multimeter if you have one sent to measure continuity or resistance to examine the two fuses. if you don't have access to a multimeter, contact support at support@lulzbot.com for more assistance with your order number, 3d printer serial number and contact information. you'll be printing soon!

budasnozzle clogged. how do i unclog it?,"i am a new 3d printer user. i have a stock taz 3 with a budasnozzle 2.0 . i struggled some to level the bed but eventually got it right. i printed my test octopus using pla (jet 3 mm natural) and all went well. during my second print the extruder clogged. i was out of time so i turned off the unit. i wish i had tried to extract the filament right then but i did not. much later i tried opening the feeder and pulling the filament out with the hot end at temp but it was well stuck. the hobbed bolt had worn a nice notch as expected. manually feeding and pulling back the filament were not working. i took the hot end off the feed mechanism and tried to pull out the filament and tried increasing the temp a little at a time without luck. the filament eventually broke off level with the aluminum plate. i tried forcing fresh filament in, no luck. 

i assume i have to disassemble the nozzle to clean it out but i cannot find any guidance on how to do it. i am open to suggestions on how to proceed and if there is a link that might help, please let me know. 

my first thought is to unscrew the nozzle from the hot end and see what i find. i assumed i could probably heat it up and feed new filament through it with the nozzle off. wille the nozzle come off the extruder while both are cold and it is in this clogged state? should i heat it up? past 180c?

i red about people soaking abs clogged extruder parts in acetone. i see no equivalent solvent for pla. does acetone work on pla like it does on abs?

after much reading i ordered some abs from lulzbot. i _thought_ pla was the more noob friendly filament type but it appears the taz 3 is optimized for abs as delivered.  i may try the ""pla mod fan"" approach lulzbot support sent me if i ever get this working again to print the duct and the pla reel sitting there makes me adventurous (or cheap). i will measure it and set the diameter in the sw.

thanks all,
tim","we recommend using the following method to remove the hot end nozzle, found in the user manual in section 8.2 on page 144 here: http://download.lulzbot.com/taz/3.0/doc ... -ebook.pdf. the text is included below:
code: select allin most cases the nozzle is best changed when the hot end is slightly
warm. never try to remove the nozzle when the hot end is at extrusion
temperature. at higher temperatures the threaded extension expands in
the nozzle causing the nozzle to bind if turned. heat the hot end to
160c.

this will soften the plastic inside the hot end and allow the nozzle to be
loosened o the threaded extension. power o the printer and continue
unscrewing the nozzle once cooler. take care when removing the nozzle
while the hot end is hot. wear leather gloves or use a towel to turn the
nozzle o of the hot end.

to change the nozzle you will need an 18mm and 13mm wrench. slide
the 18mm wrench onto the rectangular aluminum heater block away from
the heater resistor and thermistor wires.

using the 13mm wrench turn the nozzle counter clock-wise. make sure
the nozzle is turning o of the threaded aluminum extension that runs up
through the heater block. do not allow the heater block to turn. this can
put strain on and possibly damage the wiring.

once you have removed the nozzle you can then thread on the other
nozzle size you would like to use. make sure the nozzle has threaded correctly
onto the threaded extension before trying to turn it with the wrench. turn
the nozzle clock-wise until it tightens against the heater block

after installing the new nozzle you may need to adjust your z home
trigger setting before printing again. refer to the printing your first print
section (page 47) for calibrating the z home trigger setting.
if you will be changing nozzles frequently we suggest reapplying a small
amount of high temperate anti-seize to the inside threads of the nozzles.
you will need an anti-seize capable of temperature of at least
250c."
disassembling the budaschnozzel 2.0,"i'm following these instructions. https://www.lulzbot.com/support/budasch ... ater-block

i'm stuck at this step:
..use the 18mm wrench or pliers to turn the heater block, counterclockwise, off of the threaded extension.. i've attempted turning the heater block counterclockwise at with it heated to 160°c and also at 200°c, but it doesn't turn in either direction on the threaded extension. 
attached is a picture of what i'm dealing with.

i completely removed the set screw on the other side of the heater block (not captured in the picture).
the black on the top of the heater block is lulzbot black abs 3mm. i'm not really sure where it came from but i would like to check it out. 

does anyone have any input on what has happened? or, what i could do to remove the heater block from the threaded extension without damaging any threads?","use a pair of pliers to carefully and gently hold the off-white peek plastic insulator while you unscrew the threaded extension and heater block assembly. if you don't think you can do so, contact support at support@lulzbot.com with your order number, 3d printer serial number and contact information. you may get better contact on the peek insulator by disassembling the upper half of the hot end."
taz 4 quivers printing round sequences,"as stated, it shakes when printing a circle or rounded edge.  i've observed it moving in x and y axis and it does not shake when doing either of those, only when printing a rounded edge.  this causes the layer to come out squiggly along that edge.  it didn't do this yesterday.  i tried printing multiple files and it will do this every time now.  any thoughts?","when in front of the taz, use your hand to grab the entire extruder tool head. you should not be able to rotate the toolhead clockwise or counter-clockwise. if you can you may need to tighten the x axis carriage bearings. loosen the screws holding the bearings, then slide them closer to each other, and tighten the bearing holders back down. the x axis should move smoothly and evenly. try the print again."
replacing pet film,"i have some replacements on order but plan on using kapton in the mean time.. i only have one quick question. all of the application methods i've seen are wet but when i remove the glass from the taz 4 it is fused to the heated platter, is it ok to apply windex etc to this glass and squeegee it off even when it's still attached to the electronics?

most thing's i've seen say to take the glass off of the heated platform but this doesn't seem like an option.

edit: i realize now this was the wrong sub-forum my mistake.","there is a disconnect fitting on th bed, for safety i'd unplug that, and then just make sure you don't get liquid down in the bed, or if you do, wait a while for it to dry before using the machine."
dual extruder and flexystruder,"i am thinking of embarking on upgrading my taz3 to a dual extruder setup. what i would like to know is if there is a dual extruder design that combines a flexystruder as the second extruder?

also, i would like to clarify since i couldn't find a clear answer doing google searches:

can the flexystruder extrude non-flexable filaments, such as pla/abs? 

if the answer is yes, having a dual extruder setup with one extruder being a flexystruder seems like that is going to be an amazing combination and take the 3d printer market by storm!

btw, i started my research here http://ohai-kit.alephobjects.com/projec ... tallation/, which now seems to have broken links to the various ""parts needed"". is there a newer resource for instructions on building a dual extruder rig?","yes, the flexystruder can extrude solid filliament including abs and pla. the downside to doing so is that the pet liner of the flexystruder will wear more over time from friction with solid filliaments, more than it would with flexible ones. the liner is like a $0.30 part from mcmaster carr, and replacing it takes all of 90 seconds on a bad day, but it is the reason not to just use flexystruder for everything. 

the existing lulzbot flexystruder design will accomodate a flexystruder in place of one of the regular extruders without modification."
xy steppers stopped during print. but returned to home,"the printer stopped moving on the x and y axis during the raft part of the print. e and z kept running. after i quit the print, the printer would jog on the x but only in the positive direction on the y. when i hit the y home button it went back to its home, no problem and then would jog both directions in the y and everything seems to be fine again.

extruder calibration not adding up,"hello all,  

i'm clearly missing something here. following the instructions here http://ohai-kit.alephobjects.com/projec ... libration/ on calibrating my extruder on my taz4. 

basically all we are doing is working out a two ratios correct?   
estep value/100mm=current estep value/measured filament distance.  then solve for estep value.  

when ever i do this and input the new estep value my measured filament distance is no where near the 100mm. 
extruding at 100mm at 100mm/min 
estep 851.5  gives me 98.5
estep 852  gives me 98
estep 853  gives me 98
estep 870  gives me 109   (853*100)/98=870  (way over shot it)
doing the math again (870*100)/109=798...... but it was whithin 2mm at 852.   why would i go back to 798???
just doing a bunch of test prints and saying forget the math i was able to dial it in with an estep of 863.7.  which makes sense its between 850 and 870.  

so am i doing the math wrong or whats the deal?","it's a bit rough of a method, that eventually guides you back to where you need to be- from overshooting one direction to the other), but it's pretty much the standard way of doing it.

i find that once i have the extrusion steps dialled in within a couple of mm, i do test extrusions and manually dial the esteps in, save them to eeprom and once i'm happy, reflash the firmware with the updated esteps. most users are not going to have print quality issues with esteps being within a mm or two, others, like you and i, will take the extra little bit of time to get the extrusion dialled in a bit finer. keep in mind though, that different materials will have a different hardness, and will have different esteps, so your pla esteps may be different than your abs esteps. typically though, it's only off by a small amount, and isn't really noticible in the prints."

new taz 4 on-order,"hello tazites,
new to 3d printing, but following it closely for the past couple years. 
i'm looking forward to getting started with my new taz 4 which should be arriving next week.
any tips or tricks or pointers for getting started would be welcomed.

one thing that looked odd to me is step 17 of the quick-start guide. it looks like if you're not careful you could easily drive the extruder into the glass plate... and then on 18a, i'm assuming you home, slide paper, move the z-stop a tiny bit, home, slide paper, etc. until it's aligned. that sound about right?

also, after i print something, do i leave the filament in or remove it?
i have both abs and pla on order. thinking about doing a few prints with the abs and then trying the same ones with pla, different temps of course. however, i read elsewhere that it's recommended not to use the same extruder for both. is that really the case? if so, should i start with the pla or abs? and then wait until i have a 2nd extruder.
i was planning on getting a 2nd one anyway ""eventually"", to have a dual setup. although i was planning on a flexi-struder. unfortunately, i read the hard abs/pla/hips wouldn't be good in that though. any thoughts? 
i'd hate to have to buy 2 or 3 new extruders, one for each material i want to print with...
thanks in advance for your insights.","the limit switch prevents you from hitting the glass plate unless you knock it wildly out of allighment. and it homes on z at a relitivly slow rate to prevent accidental damage even if you did. is it possible to hit and crack the plate? yes. but i've only ever heard of that happening once or twice with non lulzbot machines.

the machine itself will ship pre dialed in and ready to go after assembly. assuming you don't knock it around too much while putting it together it should be level from the start. avoid turning the z endstop target when you are putting it together in particular. if you do have to allign it, then yes, the process you outline will work, with one tiny additional variable. you want to do that allignment with the machine at full printing temperature, because the nozle itself expands slightly when heated. the 2.1 nozzles are less prone to that than the older ones, but it's still something you want to account for. to that end, you may want to use a thin metal rular as the feel gauge rather than flammible paper. 

after you print something, in an ideal world you would remove the filliament and place it in an air tight dessicant filled box to ensure no humidity permiates the plastic. in reality almost everyone just leaves it on the machine unless you plan on not printing for a while. 

the abs and pla in the same extruder being a problem is due to the different melting points of abs and pla. after you print something there is usually a bit of plastic left inside the nozzle. if you start with abs, which melts at 230c, and then go down to pla, which melts at what, 160c?  any remaining abs in the nozzle will act as a plug and cause you major issues. you can overheat the pla to abs temperatures, which will cause the pla to burn but probably clear the abs plug and eventually after a bunch of wasted pla be able to print. going from pla to abs, you just end up burning out the remnants basically at abs temperatures. 

it's just easier to stick with one type of plastic

a flexystruder will work with abs, the abs will just wear down the liner faster than the flexible stuff, you can get a 1 foot long section of replacement liner from mcmaster carr for about $0.50 cents, so it's not a huge problem.

one thing you will run into when you start swapping out extruder and hot end assemblies, is that not all hobbed bolts are dimensionally identical. the lulzbot ones are closer than most, but even there i've found that the correct extruder firmware setting for one hobbed bolt tends to be slightly over or under for the next unless you take extra care and order a pile of extra hobbed bolts and match them all using calipers. easy enough to work around using the filliament width setting in slic3r, but somethign to be aware of. 

i'd start with the abs plastic personally. thats what i started with. pla seems like it would be easier because of the lower temperature, but some of the properties of the material itself make it more dfficult to work with. pla can expand slightly under heat and can lock itself into the bore of the hot end unless you have a fan on the hot end itself. it also transfers heat an unbelievable amount back up the unmelted filliament, which can cause problems on slower prints. a fan is usually the fix for that as well.abs can be a bit more difficult to get to stick to the bed at first, but once you have that part down, i find it easier to work with abs,"
taz 4 filament holder bar strength question,"hello tazzies, tazites, fellow taz folks, and soon to be taz folks   
i've been printing like a madman the past few days and some things work and some things not so much...
so, time to order and try out some different colors of filament. i've been using black so far and don't want to use it all up right now.

does anybody know if the stock filament holder on the side of the taz 4 can hold the weight of a 5lb spool of filament?
or should i look to a desktop holder? any suggestions?
also wondering if the 5lb weight hanging off the side would cause any wobble problems. i'm thinking not as the frame looks mighty sturdy.

oh, and any moisture issues with using a big spool? even at my mad pace it would take a while to go through that much.
the printer is downstairs in my indoor (in-house) shop, same space as my furnace, so i'm thinking it ""should"" be okay...

you should be fine with 5lb spools on the taz spool holder, that's how we run every machine in our cluster (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_juobuglta). we've printed some ninjaflex sleeves for the spool arms to keep the spools tight (helps eliminate tangles), but if you see issues some electrical tape or rubber bands around the holder should work fine 

i don't expect you'll have many issues with moisture if the filament is kept inside. most of the issues i've had have been with nylon, and i tend to print with bits of filament that have been lying around for months.

a few pre purchase questions,"i am getting very close to buying a new printer and the taz 4 is on the top of my list.

i do have a few questions about it before buying.

1. what kind of smooth rods does it have (chrome hardened, stainless, just hardened...)?

2. does it use linear ball bearings on the smooth rods or are they plastic sleeve bearings?

3. what electronics does it use and what firmware?

4. it does use acme threaded rods for z axis correct?

i have been printing for a little over 2.5 years now and i just want to see if upgrades will be needed out of the box or not, after upgrading my current printer from cheapo ball bearings and just hardened rods to good bearings and chrome hardened rods i feel they are a necessity for a higher end printer.","the rods are not particularly hardened material, but i've also not seen anyone manage to start wearing them out either. the rods use plastic igus bushings, but there are retrofit parts available to swap them out for bearings if you so choose, which will result in additional noise, but possibly more accuracy. the electronics are 24 volt rambo 1.2 units, possibly 1.2a running on the latest airduno marlin firmware. the lcd is the full graphic lcd, the power supply on the 4 is a new fully enclosed unit. the threaded rods have been replaced by actual leadscrews on the taz 4."
hand made cooler fan issue taz3,"hi everyone,

so i've been trying to put together some cooling for my taz3 extruder, to use with pla prints.
right on start, i've encountered an issue. i connected the cooling fan with arduino board (rambo),but it's not doing anything.
things i've done:
the fan was 3-wired, so i removed the yellow, and via transform piece i have connected plus with plus and minus with minus (thus puting black where it's supposed to be and red as well.
i've check the ""always on"" option in slicer prior to exporting the gcode for printer interface

any suggestions on what i have missed?

thanks a lot","thanks for the replies.
apparently, the first fan was broken, so the second one worked no problems. straight into arduino board.

taz hob mount broken,"can someone please tell me where to download the stl file for the taz hob mount?
please and thank you ","thanks fellas. that'd be what i'm looking for. always helpful, as usual.

i have been facinated with 3d printing tech for several years. i followed progress in the peripheral, watching developments with a feverous curiosity.
finally, i had seen enough. from all i had read and observed, i decided i would ""challenge"" the taz. this was the machine.
first of all, i am by no means an engineer. i am a commercial fisherman turned sportfisherman. i have an unprecedented curiosity into what makes fish ""tick"". which leads to the main reason for my purchase of the taz.
i had created an incredible fishing lure enhancement that i believed would catch everyone's attention ...and catch every fish. all fish.
i needed to make units and film them underwater and to have other people try them out as well. they had to be perfect in detail, comparable to a high pressure injection mold. as well, they must be sturdy and strong enough to withstand a veritable ""toothy"" beating. 3d printing in abs, i thought, was the answer. i had the cad drawing of my hand-carved unit created the year before. i was ready to go.
as i stated previously, i am not an engineer. i couldn't help but feel a little intimidated when the taz showed up on my doorstep. in fact, the box sat un-opened for several hours as i paced around it in my livingroom.
eventually i dived in. crammed hard, non-stop for many days. i read everything i could, learned the programs, learned the machine, tried some unsucessful attempts but i kept driving on and then finally, bingo. i printed the very first jughead shaker, perfectly. it was now time to get some sleep.
well, i printed a few, i go-pro filmed them underwater, showed everyone in the fishing forum and on youtube. then things went a little out of control ...everyone wanted them. they wanted lots. everywhere. from alaska to australia ...there goes my sleep time.
i turned on my taz in the first week of june and i didn't stop printing jugheads shakers until i took a break in mid october. by then i was knee-deep in pizza boxes and it was difficult to tell where my hair ended and my new beard started.
all day, every day, 24/7, taz stayed on and printing. i made 1000's of jughead shakers. some colour combos were quite creative too, i might add.
i had the odd issue with the taz, too much heat, not enough heat, calibrating, default settings, trivial stuff really. lulzbot support was very quick and spot-on but, my issues were never anything i couldn't have figure out myself. it was always ""user error"". 
two points i'll pass on: 1. trust that the machine is doing what it's told and 2. avoid the cheap filament.

ultimately, i received several offers of a partnership in business for my jughead shaker. i took the best deal on the table with a tackle company of which i now receive handsome royalties.
jughead shaker is trademarked and has an int'l patent pending with 10's of 1000's of packages being produced in several colours, sizes and rigged variations. 

within one and a half months, jughead is being sold (so far) in over 30 stores with sell-outs every few days from alaska to mexico. see the underwater videos at http://www.jugheadshaker.com.

nevertheless, i am a satisfied taz customer. i love my taz. the printing detail is awesome even at high speeds. i print dozens of pieces at a time too, the print table is huge. taz is a work-horse that has paid for itself many, many times over. i can't brag enough about it.
to the crew at aleph objects inc ...bravo! (add applause here) well done! thank you all and good luck with your endeavour my friends. you have brought mine to fruition.

sincerely,

why do bad things happen after the print finishes?,"printer = taz 3
printing from = sd
firmware = stock
slicer = slic3r with lulzbot recommended .ini settings

occasionally post print my printer will do silly things after seemingly printing successfully such as stopping immediately and saying ""wait for user input"" while the hot end melts the print (no turning off of heat, homing or kicking out of the bed).  worse (and fortunately less common) is the dreaded z axis drop.  i just printed a calibration code and upon completing the hot end just torpedoed straight into the print which broke the print, got melting abs all over the hot end, made one z threaded rod change position significantly and of course hosed the bed leveling.

note i do have a computer connected via usb with pronterface running (but not monitoring) that i use for manually moving the hot end around and more commonly manually extruding to allow picking out the grooves in the hobbed bolt.

curling on corners,"i'm having problems with corners curling up:


(click for larger pic)

this is just a test half-cube about an inch wide. i sliced it using the current taz ""medium, support off, 0.22 mm layers"" slic3r profile and printed it using lulzbot pla at 185/60. these curls develop and then propagate all the way up as it's printing.

i've printed the octo (resliced for the above profile in pla as well as using the original gcode for the abs one) and both printed really well. but then octopi have no corners...

edit: oh, and i forgot to point out the base is slightly wider than it strictly should be according to the model. i attribute that to the first layer sticking really well and the later ones shrinking/cooling.  i've also tried this where i started the bed at 65 and dropped it to 60, but that didn't really do anything (was just experimenting).","just so people don't see this thread and not the other one:

hooking up the taz 4 fan,"the taz 4 comes with a fan already on the extruder. unfortunately, no wire is run to it and the manual pretends it doesn't exist. how does one go about hooking it up? i've searched in the forums but mostly it's talk of people and their own fan solutions, so i want to make sure i do what's appropriate for this setup.

also, do you have to specifically turn on the slic3r options for the fan? looking at them, it seems like it's already on by default (at least with the provided taz profiles for pla).","hah, i found the connector! let's call this a 50/50 user error and documentation error. user error is because unlike the orange/red and mixed wire connectors, the fan connector was pulled up snug to the sheath and the other two connectors were laying on top of it. documentation error because the quick start guide doesn't mention the fan. the part for connecting the wires says only ""7) connect the extruder assemblies' 4-pin connectors: match the orange/red wire connector pair for the hot end and the mixed color wired connector pair for the extruder motor. connect the matching pairs together so they lock and click.""

had it mentioned the fan connector, i certainly would have kept digging. and there's no mention of the built-in fan in the manual, either (other than notes that you can use *a* fan). this left me with the impression it wasn't completely ready but required the user to finish the wiring.

there were a couple other issues (my bed heater socket in the electronics box somehow popped off its fasteners so i had to open the electronics box and hold it from the inside while i connected it from the outside) and the x axis rods had gotten bumped so that they were a good 5-10 degrees off level and required some real elbow grease on the right z axis rod to get it unstuck and level. but they were fairly minor and user-correctable.

well, i'm excited to see if this solves the issues i've posted about with my pla prints. if i use the posted taz slic3r profiles, will it handle the fan automatically or will i need to insert the gcode or add manual settings into slic3r myself?

thanks for the response!"
0.075mm layer height slic3r profile?,"i'm a little confused as to why there's no 0.075mm layer slic3r config. the ""fine"" one is 0.14mm. one of the driving factors in my buying the taz 4 was the 0.075 mm layer height.  is the problem that there is such much variation from individual machine to machine that all bets are off on trying to give a standard config and you have to figure it all out yourself?","where are you getting 75mm and 50mm? mm = milimeters. 75 mm 3/4 of a centemeter thick. are you thinking microns? 1mm = 1,000 microns. 75 microns would be .075mm. that's very very tiny. a human hair by comparison is usually about 10 microns thick or .010mm. 

once you start getting down that tiny, many things can affect your print quality. local air temperature. people walking by the printer. people breathing near the printer. humidity, etc. any printer is going to be affected at the extremely small end of the resolution spectrum. you can compensate for that by using ballscrews and supported linear bearing rails instead of rods, placing the unit inside a sealed climate controlled vibration isolated environment, etc. but most prointers that rely on motion components and filliament feed are going to have similar maximum resolution characteristics. the main determining factors are part quality and robustness of the motion control and bearing sytems. if you truly need very tiny resolution parts you probablyt want to save up a couple $10,000 or so for a laser sintering system of some sort. 

for what it's worth i find my taz 3.1 to be one of the more accurate 3d printers i have played with so far. there are certainly things that you could do to it to get a higher resolution out of it if you wanted to get into the extreme tinkering phase (frame rigidity modifications, maybe a linear y rail on the bed, leadscrews instead of belts, the usual), but out of the box it's just as acurate if not more so than any of the major filliament extrusion 3d printers on the market (including the makerbots, mendelmax 2, prussia i3, etc.) quality of the filliament you are using is going to be much more important than usual at that resolution as well. 

about the only filliament feed printer i can think of at the moment that could theoretically rival the resolution of the taz in a major way will be the heavily modified ballscrew z axis and linear z rail  equippd ao-10x i have, and only then once i finish the last of the x axis rail modifications. and there's only one of those on the planet at the moment. i suppose you might also be able to get super high resolution out of a rebuilt aluminatus printer too, but that would take some work."
"best versions of slic3r, printrun, etc.?","can anyone give their tips about the best version of slic3r, printrun and other software to use for the taz (4 specifically, but probably the same as the 3)? i ask because i've seen comments like ""don't use the version of slic3r that comes with printrun"" and such. and i notice that on the lulzbot download page, they still link to the mar2012 version of slic3r instead of the current one.

any gotchas i should watch out for on this front?","the download links now point to the current stable version.

in general try the latest version of slic3r, as it's had the most tuning. some of the gotcha's mainly occur in the betas and the release candidate versions. for starting out, use the preset slic3r configs available here: https://www.lulzbot.com/support/taz-slic3r-profiles to get started, and start with the medium profiles. once comfortable, try the fine/fast slic3r configuration files.

you can also check out the slic3r github issues page, to see what people are encountering, just keep in mind they may be using experimental versions."
filament keeps backing up,"i got my taz 4 in today and have been running into a snag. i can't seem to get reliable extrusion without the filament backing up and getting chunks out of it as seen here:


i don't even have it trying to print but instead have the extruder moved up several inches from the bed and am just pressing the extrude button in pronterface. the first 5-10 presses go great and it extrudes very quickly. but then it slowly starts to extrude less and less until it extrudes nothing at all. then i open the idler, pull the filament out and clip it back past the messed up part and try again and get the exact same thing.

i already tried using the pick/brush to clean out the hobbed bolt. same result afterwards.

one thing to note is the quick start instructions seem weird when it says to start with the idler bolts at 10mm and tighten down to ~5mm +/- 2mm. i find it hard to even get them to 10mm (measuring from the outside left of the thumbscrew top to the left outer edge of the plastic clip). i don't think i could get them anywhere near 8mm, much less smaller. i've tried as tight as i can get and i've tried it much, much looser and the results seem to be the same.

any advice as to what's going wrong? this is using the 1 meter lulzbot green pla sample included with the printer (more lulzbot filament arrives tomorrow).","what are the values in the lower left hand corner of the pronterface window? what temperatures are you using for what material type?

when tightening the idler screws, measure the length of the spring itself. once you have the spring compressed to around 5mm it should be giving you reliable consistent extrusions. set the manual extrude length (mm) to 100mm and the manual extrude speed (mm/min) to 150 and adjust the screws until you can repeatedly extrude."

green tape stuff pealing off bed glass,"i had a feed issue today and it was a trick to scrape off the print, i pealed off part of the green tape stuff that came on the glass of the taz3.

 i am wondering if i can take all this off and go right on the glass or am i going to need to get some new tape for the glass before my next print?","depending on how big the missing piece is, and how much you can live with a wierd looking texture on the bottom layer of your part, you can possibly get by with printing while you wait for new sheet of stuff to arrive. as theycallmejohn mentioned, the part won't stick to the glass, but it may stick well enough to the surrounding area that you can get by temporarily. you can also just drag your parts off center in slicer so you are just printing on the remaining part temporarily.

this is similar to the temperature cycling method (which never works right for me.)  lets call it the heat gun method.

1) let the extruder totally cool to room temperature.
2) loosen the springs so the filament is could be pulled out freely and is no longer bearing against the hobbled bolt.
3) elevate the nozzle up off the build surface.
4) set you software to display the the temperature curve. (apparently powerful heat guns can melt critical componets)
5) start heating the nozzle tip with a heat gun.
6) apply consistent but firm pulling force on the filament. (i use pliers but i do it in a way so so its only pulling against the extruder assembly. (i.e. not bending the rods)
7) continue to pull on the filament and heat the tip of the nozzle with your heat gun.
8) it should pop free soon giving you a nice clean plug.

on a side note, i do not work for lulzbot (  ) and i take no responsibility if you damage you printer in some way. i just know this way works the best for me. "

bed levelling,"hey folks!

 taz3 arrived yesterday. finished assembly just now. i have been working on the bed levelling for a couple hours now and i cant seem to get er eh! the back left corner is quite a bit lower than the other 3. i am wondering if i am missing something, i thought at first the bed frame wasn't sitting properly on the taz frame. it doesn't appear that would be the overall issue as only 1 corner is causing the issue.

 i am close to getting the bed levelled using all 4 corners however the back left corner is still quite high up to get the nozzle to bed tight with paper and i am wondering if this might create issues down the road being so close to un-threading from the aluminum base plate. anyways, does anyone have some suggestions on something i may have missed?

cheers!
chris,","with the provided ruler i levelled the x axis smooth rods to the aluminium bed. i worked with the bed again this morning and i have got it quite close to level now! first octopus off the printer just now.

 i also printed the bed levelling sd card file. it seemed to go 99% well. the rounded corner at the right front didn't appear to stick to the bed well producing a straight line of filament for about 1.5"" before adhering again and producing the requested round bend of filament.

 i also noticed this straightening of the filament on the initial outline of the octopus today as well, it was for a short period of time and in a different location than the original bed levelling print.

 i am using lulzbot red abs @ 230 nozzle & 110 bed. direct on glass print. i also set the extrude mm/s to 150 for the initial release of new filament to ensure constant feed, i left the feed at 150mm/s for both the bed levelling print and the octopus print by accident. it didn't appear to affect either print and i wouldn't expect this to be the reason for the filament not sticking in a couple areas. most likely i should be using painters tape etc..

chris,
p.s. i do not have the ability to check the aluminum base plate for level as of yet."

i'm still troubleshooting some other issues. for example the 40mm fan that my unit shipped with does not connect to the fan-2 connector, so i'll need a different fan or a different connector. i was advised that when upgrading you have to change the electronic's fan connector. 

also my printer / printerface has crashed 2/4 prints (not including bed level gcode). i am hosting the prints off my pc with a usb connection, considering adding a lcd / sd reader. in the past frozen printer / crashed prints have only occurred alongside or coincidentally with a frozen / crashed pc. so this is new.

my thought process was that since %100 fan speed (255 on the led gui) sits at 24v, so %50 (~128 on the led gui) sits at ~12v.
my multimeter confirmed this, but here i sit with a dead fan.

thoughts as to what fried my fan?","well i finally got my new ones in from lulzbot (radio shack is a bit of a ripoff on prices)
double checked the polarities

pronterface command:
m106 s114

voltage:
12.09 v

56 ma

run three +1hour prints without fail.
must have just encountered a bad fan

taz 40mm fan mount designs/revisions,"hi! i thought now that ive finally had success with my own custom fan mount i might share what ive done to see if anyone might benefit from this design. i haven't posted on thingiverse before but if there is interest i would be more than happy to share my design.

a little history (very little   ):

i wanted to design a fan duct based around those 40mm fans you can get from radioshack so the hole placements and everything are relative to that. i created a few designs in the beginning, first was a dual duct system that split the duct in two and curved around to blow air from about a 30 degree from the front and the back ( not pictured here), 

next was this ""odd"" looking circular duct attempt that actually works! in theory i wanted to achieve a sort of vortex air movement and cooling on all sides and top of the print while bypassing the nozzle. the obvious problem with this is that i used pla just cuz im lazy so you can imagine, being that the design calls for direct contact with the extruder head (and the heating block) it can cause for a bit of a soft goopey fan duct only after a couple of uses. (it was the smell that made me ditch it mainly)









also, with my new designs, i knew i wanted to get as close to the tip of the extruder as possible and around its perimeter, this meant ditching the stock bed corners and i came up with this design, (i call em' my ""low-profile bed corners"" or my ""hellaflush bedcorners""   ) printed in pla for hardness,  they use a built in lip that actually secures the bed glass corners without any extra junk ontop. its slightly concave on top for added strength but ive even shaved some of that off for my front right bed corner to acheive even more clearance.  ive used these corners now at even very high printing speeds and there hasn't been any issues at all (namely, bed trying to pop out of corner or something like that  )



and now for my workhorse:

this is my latest (and pretty much final) design that seems to have accomplished everything i wanted. hopefully looking at the 3d model you can figure out how the airflow works, it creates just enough high pressure to really get a very fast cooling on the filament. in the pictures you can see how the whole rig looks parked at ""home"" with my hellaflush bed corners installed  

i print my pla at 192 as i find it helps with my interlayer adhesion alot more, so having this type of rapid cooling is a must, and i couldnt get it before with other fan designs, now i can get very very small details, such as tips of cones or towers without ever over heating. im getting lazy again so ill stop typing but if anyone one has questions or advice, feel free! thank you!









thank you!!!","these are awesome! if you don't mind, please do post stls  

feel free to upload here or to bld3r (http://www.bld3r.com/) and post link here."
taz 3 z-axis moves wrong direction.,i just got done putting my taz 3 together and when i manually move the z axis in prontrface it moves the wrong way.  if i press +10 it moves the x carriage down.  is this correct or should i reverse the wiring for the stepper motors?  thanks,"is this one you built yourself? if so, power down the printer, unplug from the wall and reverse the connector orientation to test. you can also change the z axis movement direction in the firmware. what are your printer specs if this is your personal build?"
taz 3.1 upgrade from 3.0,"i was searching around in devel site and stumbled upon taz 3.1 http://devel.lulzbot.com/taz/3.1/

is this released yet? if yes, can we upgrade our taz 3.0 to 3.1? what are the diffs? thanks! ","are they snapping after transporting the printer or during long z moves? if it's the former, we have printable rod clamps we use for shipping: http://devel.lulzbot.com/taz/2.0/produc ... lamp_a.stl and http://devel.lulzbot.com/taz/2.0/produc ... mp_b_2.stl

if the z axis springs are being damaged during z moves, that only typically happens if one z motor is not moving/moving at the same rate as the other. what printer host software are you using? repetier-host has a default z move speed that's higher than recommended for the z leadscrews we're using on the taz 3d printer. is your x axis level to the y axis? if not, it can cause binding on the z axis.

thoughts about the taz 3 from taz 3 owners wanted,"i have narrowed down my search for a 3d printer to just a few of which the taz 3 is one of the front runners.  i have seen may opinions spread across the web on the taz 3 many good and some bad but it seems as though a certain amount of them are from people who have no practical experience with the printer.  i am looking for actual users to help me decide.  can you please tell me what made you choose the taz 3 and your thoughts after purchase both good and bad.   i am new to all of this so at this point i only know what i have read and realize opinions vary and that there are ""fan boys"" that back a product no matter if it is good or not.  i haven't found many reviews for the taz 3 but the view of the company seems  good.  i have just seen multiple postings that there are several ""better"" printers for the money.   do you feel there is anything missing on the taz 3?  i don't have practical experience with 3d printers so i don't know how essential one feature is over the next. i guess when it comes to facts you first have to figure out what is important here are some things that come to mind for me (in no particular order). how does the taz 3 do in these categories?

1.  reliability - does it break down, need excessive maintenance or repair?
2.  customer support / company reputation - have you been happy with the tech support you have received?
3.  quality/precision of prints - i have seen much written about this but i haven't determine what values are ""state of the art""  in the taz's price range
4.  consistency of prints - once fine tuned are print repeatable without a lot of fuss?
5.  speed of prints - is it slow, fast or in between?
6.  ease of use - do you have to be a master of all things 3d to have success using it?
7.  features - missing anything or is there something you wish it had?
8.  community support - i think i know the answer to this one 
9.  upgradability - does the design lend itself to addons, updates and enhancements?
10.  amount and frequency of ""tweaking"" - how much time is required to keep printing things of high quality?
11.  components - is any of its parts outdated?

did i miss anything that is an important items to compare/consider when purchasing a 3d printer? i am also considering a makergear m2 so if anyone has experience with both i would like to know how they compare.

thanks","i technically own a taz 3 now, so i guess i qualify to answer some of it.

1. the early taz 1 and 2's had an issue that caused the size z nut springs to split in some cases. they have redesigned the part so that does not occur anymore, and seemed to be really good about getting replacement parts to the small handful of people who had issues with it. there was also an electrical update for one component that they sent a service part out free of charge to everyone who had an affected printer. aside from those issues the main issues that we see in the forum here are related to bearings or allignment, which you will see with all printers. 
2. i don't think you will find a 3d printer company with better customer support or a better reputation. 
3. quality seems to be fairly high from what i have seen, it's the same basic motion style and extruder style you will see with most cartesian style printers, and skill of the user does come into play, along with filliament quality, etc. i believe it to be on par with the mendelmax 2.0, the makerbot printers, or any other printer you care to name. i do also think there are some areas that still could be improved on all those printers, but that the community or the designers will also make those upgrades happen. 
4. yes. 
5. it's pretty fast from what i have seen, but again, it is a very large printer so it has a large area of potential travel. a smaller bed printer may be able to print certain things faster. 
6. no more so than any other 3d printer on the market. there are certain things you need to know or learn to print successdully with any 3d printer. most of them are pretty easy to pick up, but someone who doesn't know what they are doing can have a difficult time. i will say that it seems to have one of the more complete ""getting started"" user manuals of any printer out there. but they really do walk you through all the steps needed to get started with pictures, etc. most of the first print issues that people post in here are by people that haven't looked at the manual. 
7. has pretty much all the bells and whistles, either included or available as designed options (including fans, dual extruders, etc.) about the only thing it's missing is a lighting subsystem, and i plan to rectify that shortly. 
8. all the people in this forum are jerks, especially that piercet guy he's a real... hehe, just kidding. no, we've got one of the better 3d printing communities out there in here i think. 
9. yes, very much so. see the development forum for further details. 
10.  not a whole lot, the main thing that can vary is the bed height adjustment can sometimes take some getting used to. 
11. they are continually upgrading components. also the user community helps out a bunch. the only part you could arguably consider to not be on the bleading edge would be the extruder hot end, simply due to the temperature limitations inherent with the peek isolator. they are reportedly working on a higher temperature hot end to address that issue, but not many people are trying to print with super high temperature flliament to begin with so i wouldn't put that as a mark against them. most of the compontnets, epsecially the bed, the lcd enclosure, the electrical enclosure are among the best out there in my oppinion anyways. 

i've never heard of anyone having a bad issue with this company. their staff posts in here regularily, including the owner of the company. everything is completly open source. all the documentation, parts, development stuff, and pictures of their facilities are available in the various download folders referenced in the support area. they build them in the usa, etc. i suppose their shipping on some of their smaller items from the store might be a little high, but thats about the only downside i can think of. 

in fairness i probably qualify as one of those fanboys,  but i did a lot of research too before i aquired my first lulzbot ao-100 and i have never regretted that purchase at all. 

hope that helps!"
taz 3 y axis skipping steps?,"i believe i'm getting skipped steps on my y-axis. my prints come out with area's shifted 1-2mm to one direction on the y axis. consistent all the way up with spacing anywhere from 5-15mm between shifts. the shifted print area only last for about 5-10 layers and then it shifts back. i will upload pictures tonight. i think the problem might be my servo's overheating? i'm running the medium abs auto support slic3r settings from lulzbots site with a few adjustments that would not affect this like a wider brim . 

here's my analysis so far.
-first noticed on large prints with large infill area's (1hr plus times and sizes larger than 60mm area's)
-small objects less than 40mm by 40mm and print times of under 40 minutes or so are fine

what i've done to mitigate the problem at the moment
-slowed any speeds in slicer to be no faster than 105. the only 2 speeds that were faster are nonprint moves(150) and nonsolid layer infill(115).

slowing the speeds has completely stopped this from happening but has added a lot of extra time to my prints. i'm pretty sure the infill speed of 115 was fine but the movement speed of 150 was the problem. i haven’t tried to isolate it any further yet but i just wonder if anyone else has had this problem. like i said tonight ill put up pictures of the prints and also hit the servos with my ir thermometer. is my thinking right or is it something else?","how tight does the belt feel on the y axis? use this method to guage: http://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/th ... s_of_meat/ (a bit odd, but it works!) somewhere around medium-well is tight enough.

check the belt pulley on the y axis stepper motor. it should be firmly secured onto the stepper motor shaft using the set screw. the belt shouldn't rub on anything but should be centered within the pulley and idler belt path."

heyo! the bearingholder_autolevel is a work in progress, we're thinking of adding a detent to the bearing holder and a spring to the toggle mount to try and improve the acuracy of the switch position when it's lowered.

i'd stick with 1013's design for the time being, users have put a lot of hours on that thing and it works really quite well 

the strengthened x mounts will help, but aren't necessary. since the printhead is going up and down and taking precise measurements, you want to make sure there's as little slop as possible, and these help.

taz 3 motor extensions,"hey i was wondering if anybody could tell me which motor extensions go where?  in the taz bom they have them listed as motor extension 1, motor extension 2 and so on.  i'm guessing the 1300mm extension is for the extruder.  what axis do the other ones goto?  thanks","motor extension 1 = y motor
motor extension 2 = x motor

y-axis end mounting holes wrong,i was just wondering if anybody else had this problem.  i had the y-axis end custom made from the .dxf file on the lulzbot website but when i tried to mount the bearing mount to it the holes were way off.  is the file wrong on the site?  it looks like the holes are too close together.  does anybody know the measurements for where the bearing mount holes are suppose to be?  thanks,"the holes should be 40mm apart in x, and 29mm apart in y to match the printed part hole spacing.

i just checked the .pdf here: http://devel.lulzbot.com/taz/3.1/produc ... /drawings/ and for some reason the holes are only 16mm apart in x.

i quickly changed the spacing for you in the printed part, though the nut trap holes might cause a little bit of an overhang issue. check the .stl to see what i mean.

you can find the new .stl file here: http://devel.lulzbot.com/taz/3.1/produc ... ts/y_idler (once it syncs) and i've attached it here, too.

i recommend using this slic3r config: http://devel.lulzbot.com/taz/3.1/produc ... 0noz-t.ini

taz double bearing holder tight fit,"hi, i printed the double bearing holder-2.0 and when i try to insert the igus bearings it's a really tight fit.  the smooth rod is also really hard to move once it's inserted.  is it suppose to be like that or should the bearings slide right in the holder?","when we print double bearing holders for production, we test them by taking a 10mm rod that weighs 400 grams and seeing if the rod slides down through the bushings under gravity while the double bearing holder is held vertically. this means that if it takes more than ~4 newtons of force to slide the bushings along the rod, then the double bearing holder does not pass qc, and the machine that printed it is re-calibrated before printing more parts for production.

ideally, there will be just a *tiny* bit of misalignment between the bushings. when they are perfectly aligned, the little bit of clearance between the bushings and the rod will allow the double bearing holder to wiggle. with just a tiny bit of misalignment, the bushings are pre-loaded laterally for maximum position-ability of the toolhead without too much drag on the rod."
taz bearing holder how to insert bearing,i was wondering how you insert the bearings inside the holder?  i'm having problems trying to get them in.,"they just slide in. if it is too tight, you may have to adjust your print. we do have gcode available for taz and ao-100 for taz parts:

(help!) print bed moves too far on y axis,"hi everyone,

i'll try to explain this the best i can, and hopefully i can post a video soon. recently when i press print, the printer homes all three axes like normal, but something seems terribly wrong with the y axis. the print bed will move as if to home the y axis, but then it ""freaks out"" and keeps moving toward the back of the printer. seems as if the step motors keep running and pushes the bed all the way to the back. the the motor will continue to run, but the belt just slips on the pulleys since the bed is as far back as it can go. this lasts for about 5 seconds and then it finally homes and begins to print. what the hell is going on? is this a firmware issue? maybe something going on with the gcode? i'll try to post a video at some time to better show what's going on. i appreciate your thoughts and guidance on this!","you can also use the ""m119"" command in pronterface, to check the current endstop status. send it once without the endstop being activated, and once again with the endstop manually triggered (held down with your finger). the endstop status should change. the y axis endstop may have shifted further into the housing, causing it to not be triggered the way it would normally. a m3 setscrew is present within the brass heat-set insert above the endstop. the endstop housing should be visible and flush with the endstop mount housing. the lever should be activated when the y axis bed is moved to the back. press the ""motors off"" button to move each axis around manually to easily check."
blown fan 2 mosfet,"so in preparation to install a fan mount for printing pla, i was testing voltages output by the pins on the rambo.
i guess i accidentally shorted the pins on fan 2 (shown in the figure below) and heard a pop.
after plugging the fan back in and flipping the power switch the fan just 'twitches' and led 8 (shown in the schematic below), pulsates in sequence with the fan.
testing revealed that the internal diode of the irlml6346trpbf (q8 in the schematic) is blown.

does anyone know or can think of a work-around for this? 
does anyone know how to re-purpose fan 1 to function as fan 2 did?
*note: section in question is in the 'mosfets' portion of the schematic

i don't really possess the equipment needed to replace the mosfet itself.

thanks all.","i tried plugging in to the first fan connector as you suggested, but the fan doesn't turn on. (i'm not sure if there is a way to change this in settings or not)
you can always power the fan off the same case fan connector
i'm not sure what you mean by this

the right pin of the fan2 connector still outputs 24v when turned on, but if i ground the fan directly to the case ground there is 24v and 3a running through a 12v 0.08a fan (i.e. loud and overworked   )"
"strange ""striping"" of extruded filament","after weeks of printing like a champ, my taz2 has started exhibiting the following symptoms: regular ""striping"" of filament. it will start a bottom layer looking awesome, and then 4-5-6 or so stripes in, there will be a missing/clogged/terrible one, then good ones, then terrible...check these two photos to see what i mean:





the pattern continues up the print, to the point where my top layers are all gapped and patchy looking.

what i've done: re-re-re-leveled. cleaned the extruder, cleaned the hobbed gear, re-adjusted the tension on the extruder.

at my wits end. what's going on? it was producing beautiful prints, and one day just started this.","try this slic3r config and see how that affects things: https://www.lulzbot.com/support/taz-slic3r-profiles you may also want to lower the z axis endstop adjustment screw slightly, perhaps around a half a turn clockwise to increase your first layer height."
rapid stripping of filament on hobbed gear,"we are having a problem with abs filament quickly getting stripped on the feed gear. it won't make it through a bed leveling run without malfunctioning by not feeding filament through the hot end reliably, thus resulting in a great variation in layer height on the level pattern. we have tried many different tensions (from very tight to very loose) on the adjustment and it doesn't matter. any help at troubleshooting this problem is appreciated.

thanks,

phil...","your nozzle is too close to the heated bed, possibly coupled with an out of level bed. shavings in the hobbed bolt may chamber may be further compounding this. to fix.

step 1: clean the hobbed bolt chamber to remove all shavings. take special care to remove impacted material from the hobs themselves and from around the bearings on the idler. 

step 2. heat the machine to operating temperature, then wait 15 minutes to allow for normal operational expansion of the hot end. 

step 3. using a thick business card that looks nonflammable or a thin metal gauge set the thickness you want at your home point. now move the nozzle in the y direction and check again using the gauge or the card as a feeler. take care so as to not burn yourself or light things on fire. now move the x axis over in 1 inch chunks, continually checking that the height feels the same. if you find a change as you approach one side or the other, adjust the height of the bed plate accordingly. repeat the process to either side of the y axis as well. once you are satisfied the nozzle is the same height from the bed at operating temperature at any point on the bed, return to home and print your calibration print. 

that should fix it. you may also want to make sure the filliament is feeding properly with the nozzle raised away from the bed to make sure you don't have any other extruder issues. 

poor quality filliament can also sometimes cause excess grinding if you are using something sourced from less reputable sources."
taz 2 print quality finally sorted (hopefully),"we have really been struggling with print quality issues with our taz 2 printer and were getting really frustrated about not getting anything that resembled a decent print. we were trying all kinds of different filament (all from lulzbot), testing different slic3r settings, constantly calibrating the bed and nothing was working. we'd often get prints that looked like this (and this was one of the better prints):



 problem print 


i went to the open house recently at aleph objects and was able to show one of the engineers examples of our prints and got some advice about what to do, what to take a look at, etc. they first instructed me to do an extrusion calibration to make sure the machine was feeding the correct amount. after running that test, it was fine (no issues). i then did a large series of bed calibrations (adjusting bed springs and z-axis end stop) to make sure it was ""just right"" on the height of the filament being extruded--it's amazing how fine the adjustments are you need to make with both the z-axis end stop and the bed spring screws.

after getting that all dialed in, we were still getting really inconsistent prints. we were using the ""medium"" slic3r profile available for download from the taz 2 downloads section. lulzbot staff asked that i send the slic3r profile we were using (the one we downloaded from the lulzbot site) and they said there were some strange settings in it. they emailed me a slic3r profile they'd been using and told me to try it with our objects. looking at our first prints with the profile they provided--the changes were dramatic with the new parts we printed with the new profile. we are finally getting parts that look like they are supposed to--i'd just about given up on the printer.

here's an example of a recent print. on the left is what we were getting, on the right is what we are getting using the new slic3r profile:



 printed gears 


i've attached the slic3r profile to this thread in the hopes that it might help any of the rest of you that are struggling with this.","you'll find that when printing smaller objects, increasing the infill density is helpful.

the main differences between the medium config file posted here (nice print btw!) and the one posted in the download section are:

fill_density = 0.8 vs 0.2 
perimeters = 3 vs 1 (always a good idea to have more perimeters for parts when the main force/wear will be the walls.)
slower printing speeds throughout (will give a cleaner print)

start_gcode = g28 ; home all axes\ng1 z5 f5000 ; lift nozzle (the last part- g1 z5 f5000 will lift the z axis as the first movement after homing. depending on how tight your z axis endstop adjustment is, this may be fine, or cause poor first layer performance. either lower the endstop adjustment slightly to compensate, or remove the g1 line if it causes issues)

you'll find that you'll end up tweaking your existing slic3r profiles for different parts, as there is no one good universal slicing profile. you'll need to balance things out based on the desired charachteristecs of the part.

taz 3 noise and smell considerations,"hi, 

i am on the verge of purchasing the taz 3 and am starting to dream of all the wonderful things i am going to print with it. a couple of questions if someone could chime in though. i will make 3 separate threads as they are very different questions:

2 of 3) as a kid i have had alot of....experience with melting plastics and the related toxic smells produced by it. in all fairness setting plastic ablaze is a bit different than heating it to it's melting point but it would seem to me that plastics would still give off a smell of some sort. 

is the smell from some/all materials available to be printed (at this time at least) worth placing the printer near an exhaust (like t'ing off of a dryer vent with an in-line fan) or is the smell if any not noticeable? also, how loud is this printer? is it comparable to:
a) a desktop laser printer
b) a paper shredder
c) a palm sander
d) nine inch nails concert
e) other
(i guess i'm saying do i need vibration dampening or an enclosure around it of some sort to keep the noise if any to a tolerable level with palm sander being a bit loud for the location it's going to sit in)

thanks!","the smell aspect depends on what you are printing. the pla plastics smell sweet, like the sugar they are made from. abs smells bad, but its not overpowering. i find i can tolerate small prints without the exhaust fan on, but larger prints are required fan items. pla fumes are also much better for you than abs fumes. 

noisewise it should be comperable to an ao-10x even though the taz is larger, so i can speak to that some. a well dialed in and tuned printer is about as loud as a paper shreadder or one of the louder laser printers. you can take steps to quiet them further, such as putting in cork layers between the nema motors and the frame, putting the whole thing on softer rubber anti vibration feet / pads, or placing it inside an enclosure. 

enclosure is more warrented for temperature control and exhaust gas routing than it is for noise in my oppinion."
octoprint - movement speeds,"we've been using octoprint with our taz 2.1 and having really great results with it. it is nice to be able to monitor the printer remotely via web cam, upload prints, take time-lapse videos, etc. the software tries to calculate print times based on movement parameters in the settings, and it looks like the default settings aren't quite matching to what the taz 2.1 actually produces. i'm trying to find out what the following settings might be for this printer:

movement speed x-axis (currently set to 6000mm/min)
movement speed y-axis (currently set to 6000mm/min)
movement speed z-axis (currently set to 200mm/min)
movement speed extruder (currently set to 300mm/min)

any help or ideas would be appreciated. great tool though!","hopefully one of the guys from the cluster will see this and answer. we are using octoprint on 9 machines that we have outfitted with beaglebone blacks.

abs shrinkage,"hi everyone, i'm trying to print a relatively large item, and i can't seem to get it to work, i believe because of abs shrinkage.  here is what it looked like when i originally tried it:



i googled and read through the forum, and attempted the following things to fix it:

1) turned down the temperature on the bed to 85 (i'd still had it at 110 even though the newer instructions said to lower it, mainly because when i lowered it before, things didn't stick anymore.  i have since added abs slurry to help make things stick)

2) added an additional ""skirt"" around the bottom of the model to help the corners to stick better, which i will then chop off when it's done.  the shrinkage occurred on corners that had not peeled up as well as the ones that did, but i figured this was a good idea anyway.

3) put a large cardboard box over the printer to keep the heat in

i then reduced my model by 50% to test my improvements, but it's still a problem.  here is the result:



and



not only does it still have cracks, but the sides are now kind of chewed up.  i believe the reason it has less cracks than before is probably mostly just because the size was reduced by 50%, but maybe some of what i did helped.  in any case, i still need to fix it.  does anyone have any additional suggestions?

i can't break this into smaller pieces and then assemble (plus, the whole reason i bought this printer was for the larger print size), and i can't make the piece any thicker.  

thank you!","hello all, 

first i would  like to thank everyone for the questions and answers in all areas of the forum.  it has been a tremendous help as a newbie to 3d printing.

i too had the shrinkage issue and have done a couple things that has eliminated it.  i followed triffid hunters calibration guide and recommendations to use a .2mm layer height.  that has been the most help with each nozzle, .35mm, .5mm, and .75mm also.  in addition i use a small reptile heat lamp with a 25watt bulb pointed at the work piece.  the light is located at the front of the machine where the lulzbot sign is at on the taz 2 pointed down at an angle to the center of the bed.  i have done some pretty nice sculpted vases with no delamination using both the .5mm and .75mm nozzles.  i prefer the .75mm nozzle as the vases are heavier.  i also am running a 3mm brim on all my pieces now.  this eliminated any warping around the corners.  i intend to add another heat lamp in the same location on the back side of the machine.

i did try the skirt  before all the above and it did help unless the skirt delaminated, broke, and caused other issues.  i contemplated building the enclosure but opted for the heat lamp after coming across a picture of a student making a sculpted vase on a rostock style printer.  he was using 3 radiant heat lamps pointed at the object being made.

hope that helps."
bed calibration print question,"when we print the bed calibration file, we get a good print, but i often wonder about how it comes out as it isn't consistent in the corners. meaning in the front, the outer ""box"" has very rounded wide corners, but in the back, the corner radius us must smaller. also, the tips of the ""x"" are further from the corner in the front, but closer in the back. i just wanted to know if this is actually how it is supposed to look, or if we have an issue with how it is printing? the attached image is how our calibration print looks.



 bed calibration print (taz 2) 
",that calibration print was from the cgode file that was on the sd card shipped from the factory. so is the factory gcode sliced with the wrong bed center coordinates? is there an stl file for that bed calibration print the i can re-slice with updated settings?

taz 3.0 large herringbone gear,"could someone point me to the stl file of the current large gear for the subject printer?  the gears from the download section are .020"" thinner than the stock gear that comes with the printer.  the large gear is .437 thick while the models from the download section is measuring .417"".

taz 3 ability to mid job pause/filliment change?,"hi, 

i am on the verge of purchasing the taz 3 and am starting to dream of all the wonderful things i am going to print with it. a couple of questions if someone could chime in though. i will make 3 separate threads as they are very different questions:

1 of 3) i am wanting to make a custom holder for all of my ratchet's sockets at work. it would be a block (lets say red abs) with a series of blind holes with varying depths and over each hole there would be a raised value stating the size of the socket which i'd like to do in a contrasting color like black.

can you predictably pause the printer at a certain part of the print and change out the filament to a different color?

or

could you print the 'red block' as one project, swap the filament once it's done and start a new print using the top of the red block as the new ""bed"" to print the lettering?

thanks!",it is possible to pause the printer by inserting a pause command into your g code (usually accompanied by a move the hot nozzle off the part i am making so it doesn't melt a hole in it while it is stitting there and then move it back where it was command) what you describe is going to be much easier and cleaner to do with a dual extruder setup though. swapping filliaments you will have an unspecified amount of color mixing that has to occur before the new color starts coming out. on the older buddaschnoszzles at least i find you have to extrude about 30mm worth of plastic before it even notices it has a different color filliament in it.
taz heated bed - no longer going up to temp,"i've been happily printing away on my taz for the last two weeks or so with no issues at all (other than needing to level the bed & reset the z-home to get the height just right).

over the weekend, i noticed that my heated bed can no longer get up to 110c.  i've been able to get it up to temp in about 13 minutes until two days ago.  i just tried it again this evening - going from a powered off 21c to 65c took it over 20 minutes and it seems to have stalled out around that temp based on the temperature reading in pronterface.

if i put my hand above the glass plate of the bed, it feels like it's much closer to 110c than 65c, but i don't have an accurate way to check it.  i did print with pla & abs though and this definitely feels more than 5c hotter than the 60c setting i was using for the pla.  the wiring to the heater and the thermistor look fine as far as i can tell.

has anyone else experienced this issue?  any ideas of things to check to troubleshoot?","jebba: i checked the wiring and nothing looked unusual as far as i could tell.  i've been talking to claudio via email and have and rma # ready, so i'll be ups'ing the bed back for you guys to see in the next day or so.

in case it helps you or anyone else on the forum, what we found was that my bed's resistance was higher than it should be.  the first day i measured it, it was 1.8 ohm and now it seems to be around 1.2 - 1.4 ohm - i'm not sure why it varies a bit, but it's never been lower than 1.2 ohm anytime i've tested it.  it sounds like lulzbot hq beds are showing about 0.8 ohm based on info from claudio.

i have a friend in town that also bought a taz so i took my heated bed over there to test.  when hooked up to his machine, my bed shows the same issue - very slow to heat up it was just over 35c after about 6 minutes of heating.  when we popped his bed on again, it was up to 75c in exactly the same amount of time.  his has no trouble getting up to 85c or even up to 110c.  i checked his bed resistance and it was 0.8 - 0.9 ohm at room temp.

my bed takes about 45 minutes to get up to 80c and it can't get to 85c at all.  after waiting 15 more minutes after it it 80c, it actually went down a bit in temp even though power was still being applied (the target was set to 85c).  i attached a thermocouple to the center of the bed while doing this heating test and in my case, my thermistor is accurately showing the correct temp, but the bed itself can't seem to heat up past 80c (on the thermistor / 85c on the external thermocouple) no matter what.  in case you're interested, i published the timing test results here:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc ... sp=sharing

all that said, i'm going to ship my bed back to lulzbot hq so this can get figured out, but it definitely looks like there is an issue in the heater itself."
lulzbot taz 3??,"hello everyone!

i'm still in the early stages of planning out my taz build (trying to find a local laser cnc to cut acrylic for me! surprisingly, i haven't had any luck finding someone with even a simple cnc machine...)

anyway, on a whim i decided to check out http://devel.lulzbot.com/taz/

i see two new (or i think they are) folders - /3.0/ and /3.1/

i don't seem to recall reading about a taz 3.0. last i was looking, i saw 2.1 was the latest edition. has there been any official announcement?","first off -- this kind of version change roll out isn't unique to 3d printer world.  it happens without fanfare with lots of things - consumer electronics, home appliances, etc.  i think the difference is that we tend to be a small, highly focused community that is paying such close attention to the minute details of product feature, availability, etc. that it is very difficult for a manufacturer to roll out a new version without either taking a break between versions (e.g. out of stock for months) or having to clearance old models as soon as people know there is a new model coming.

having said that, aleph is in the process of learning their way through this.  it doesn't appear that they have a consistent policy for new version introduction other than making designs for upgraded printable parts freely available.  looking at their roll-out history, they started clearancing the a-101 while we were still waiting for the taz 1 (good, standard move), they stopped making taz 1 and were out of stock for a significant amount of time while getting taz 2 ready for roll out (not too bad on customers, other than impatience -- probably very bad for cash flow), and they pulled taz 3 out of their hat (surprise!) with a major change in heated bed which (presumably) will address many of the common bed problems people are having.  now, if you dig through their development files this shouldn't have been too much of a surprise.  there is extensive documentation on development and testing of the upgraded heated bed dating back almost a year.  however, making this much of a change without notice is a good way to alienate current customers  -- most of us would prefer to have a choice of earlier model at slightly discounted price vs. waiting for new model.  and not everyone would choose to wait so the previous version would continue to move, albeit at a reduced pace.

once common way to mitigate the customer alienation is to offer an upgrade path at the same time that you do the new model roll out.  this would have been doable with taz2 since the most notable change was the control panel/sd card capability and this component is readily available.  perhaps working a deal with the manufacturer so that taz 1 owners could get it at a discounted price.  unfortunately this still isn't offered.

obviously this would be much harder to do with the new heatbed, particularly since it now requires a 24vdc supply.  so, what could aleph have done?  one additional trick used by many of the big names is to announce the new model but set the pricing noticeably higher than the previous model.   customers will then make the value judgement before roll out, continuing to buy the old version.  then, two months or so after roll out, do the price reduction.  this softens and distributes the current owner impact -- really early adopters of the new version are accustomed to paying a premium and understand that prices will fall, recent purchasers of the previous version are generally satisfied that they saved significant $$ when they made the purchase and had the use of the printer during the months when the new version was more expensive.

anyway, i'm no expert on this, there are lots of books written on the topic and plenty of case studies to look at.

here's my position -- i bought one of the first taz 1's -- i never got it to work satisfactorily and it is currently in pieces in a box waiting for me to have time to redesign and rebuild it.  hindsight is always 20/20 - maybe i shouldn't have purchased it.  maybe, knowing what i know now, i might not even have bought the taz 3.   am i angry at aleph?  absolutely not.  i'm a tech savvy, early adopter.  we spend money on new technology knowing that there is risk and knowing that prices will go down and that features will improve.  taz was not my first 3d printer and won't be my last.  i will continue to research, test, design, fabricate, buy, etc. 3d printers and components looking for the technology that best meets my professional needs.
could aleph have made better choices in how they rolled out taz 3?  absolutely, and i'm sure they'll refine their new product introduction strategy as a result of your feedback.  my greatest wish is that they would offer all of the custom-made vitamins in their store as soon as each new model is rolled out.

so let's look at this as members of a tight-knit community of innovators, rather than as consumers of generic mass-produced pablum available at any walmart.  we all invest in trying these new things.  if anyone asked us, we would probably use the word ""invest"" at some point.  inherent in any investment is the element of risk - risk that it won't work, risk that we paid too much, risk that the next version will have more awesome features, risk that it won't actually do what we need it to do.  but as an investment, there is also the reward side of the equation.  we are doing something that very few people know how to do (so far).  we're getting a head start with a tool that will be ubiquitous some day and will have the chance to do things that can create careers and industries.  

a few hundred dollars here, a few missing features there, these are the bumps that we take to be in the lead."
extruder leaked,"i got the bed level yesterday and then today ran the stl file through slic3r.

set the temperature to 185 (extruder), 60 (bed) and let it heat up. loaded the gcode and went to work on another project. i returned a little later and ... crap. i didn't check but the last profile had the temperature in slic3r set to 200. the extruder leaked. i turned it off and haven't touched it since.

pics are here 



 and

any suggestions how i can clean this up and then reassemble and tighten everything?

thanks","cdressler wrote:we are having the pla leaking issues as well. orias, from your post, you mention this thread:

https://www.lulzbot.com/?q=support/buda ... a-solution

i can't tell the difference in what is being done in option 1 and option 3 with the pfte tape, it looks like it was applied in the same place in both examples. can you provide any more detailed instructions on how to accomplish option 1?


all budaschnozzles in stock in our warehouses and installed on our taz printers have the heater block/threaded extension threading covered with a layer of ptfe tape, similarly to solution 1. 

generally, if you're using translucent pla it needs to be printed at a cooler temperature, usually 5-10c cooler than the matte colors."
small herringbone drive gear hard to install,"i re-printed a couple of the small herringbone extruder drive gears as the one that shipped with the printer broke and i wanted a couple of spares just in case. when i tried to put the new one on that i printed, it took a huge amount of effort to try and push it onto the stepper motor, to the point i thought i might break the motor. also, trying to get the small nut into the hole in the bottom of the gear was really difficult as well. these were printed in abs.

are the variances supposed to be this tight for these parts, or is there something wrong with the prints?",the parts are tight. we will drill out the center shaft for the stepper motor shaft. the captive nut is pushed in.
abs clumping,"hey all, i have a taz 3 that i am setting up. i am having a problem with the abs ""clumping"" on the z calibration print. the extruder seems to be running okay, but the abs is clumping together on the bed sometimes, particularly after the extruder has turned a corner or just stopped/started. anybody got any thoughts on this? ","okay, i managed to figure out the problem. it was a combination of adjusting the z switch, and clearing out small bits of filament stuck on the hobble wheel. when i took the extruder apart, i found that the grooves in the hobble wheel were filled with small pieces of filament, and that meant that the filament was slipping.

so, after clearing that out and resetting the z level adjustment, no more clumping and the test print is nice and smooth. 

however, i think this was caused by a design issue in the printer. the pronterface software stops the extruder from extruding when it is cold, but the built-in controller doesn't. so, what i think i did was to accidentally start a bed test print (which does not include commands to pre-heat the extruder and bed) without pre-heating the extruder. this meant that the hobble wheel was chewing away at the filament, which couldn't go anywhere. instead, it just gnawed off bits of filament and got clogged up.

my suggestion from this would be to either add pre-heating commands to the bed test print (and then create one for abs and one for pla), or add a check in the firmware that prevents the extruder from extruding when cold. 

tl:dr -  if you are getting globby, clumpy prints like mine, clean out your extruder and check your z height adjustment."
gcode files for the taz 2.1 extruder gears,"hi, i just god my taz 2.1 it works, but when it prints slowly, the extruder gear jams, i think is bad printed..

somebody have the gcode files for the 2 extruder gears, so i can prints new ones..

kind regards.
jan","big gear: 
http://download.lulzbot.com/taz/2.1/pro ... arge_gear/

little gear:
http://download.lulzbot.com/taz/2.1/pro ... mall_gear/ 

unless the geat looks visually off, it shouldn't be the gear itself. try turning the machine off, removing the filliament and see if you can manually turn the gears  all the way. if they seem to mesh well chances are it isn't the gear itself. 

some things that are more likely culprits:  check the setscrew on the smaller gear and make sure it is really tight on the nema motor shaft. also check the hobbed bolt chamber and make sure you don't have a bunch of stripped filliament preventing the extruder from feeding right, and check that the tension on the idler arm is set to specification from the manual

the nozzle itself can also clog. especially if you are running one of the laywood type filliaments or a cheaper non-lulzbot filliament with debris in it. the smaller nozzles are much easier to clog than the .5 one.

edit: also, if it is a bad gear, you should probably contact customer service and have them get you a new one  since the machine is definitly still under warranty if it is a retail one."
"broke my herringbone gears, and fried stepper motor?","so i think a small piece of filament must have landed between the herringbone gears as a few teeth on one side of the small gear have crumbled off. i love how these parts can be printed to fix and upgrade the machine, but i don't have any friends with 3d printers. looks like the lulzbot spareshttp://www.lulzbot.com/?q=products/greg ... d-extruder are out of stock (see after selecting a colour), would someone ship one to australia for bitcoins/paypal? 

also after removing the extruder motor from the extrusion assembly it appears to have problems itself.. does it take much to fry these things? when i give it the extrude command (overriding cold extrusion prevention) it basically vibrates and doesn't rotate unless i give it a twist. has anyone else suffer the same thing? wondering if i need to order a nema 17 too.","it sounds like you have an intermittent or missing connection on the stepper motor. verify that all the connector pins are fully seated in the connector housing and reconnect. if that does not solve the extruder stepper motor vibrating, use a multimeter to test the continuity of the wiring pairs. the four wires on the stepper motor consist of two pairs.

we can certainly replace the herringbone gears, send an email to support@lulzbot.com with your taz 3d printers serial number (found on the rear of the 3d printer, towards the bottom of the electronics enclosure), your order number and shipping address. your taz 3d printer has a 90 day warranty. please include some photographs showing the gears and extruder body. we'll get you printing again, either under warranty, or for minimal cost.

you may also want to see if you have a makerspace/hackerspace in the area, or check in the #reprap irc channel on freenode to see if there's a local reprapper you have yet to meet.

the herringbone drive gears are standard, well supported and community approved designs. they hold up rather well, and rarely need replacing. this is the first time we've encountered two customers with gear issues in one month. i've used the wades extruder with the herringbone gears and have only had to replace the gears once, after almost  a year of operation, running 20-30 hours a week."
firmware upgrade taz 3.0,"being unhappy with most results after fiddling around so much to optimize everything as good as possible i want to upgrade the printers firmware and see if anything might change for the better.

upgrade file used:

z 800 steps
e0 828 steps

i follwed the instructions here: http://www.lulzbot.com/?q=support/re-fl ... s-firmware
and changed the e0 value for the extruder accordingly and saved the file.

opening the marlin.ino also works but the next step gives me an error. first it told me to select the mega 2560 board, which i did, then it told me u8g_fntpgm_uint8_t does not name a type.

i think there is a glitch in the code. please help me solve the upgrade problem.","the taz 3 firmware is only meant for 24v powered taz 3d printers. there's no real reason to reflash the board, unless you've changed from a 12v to a 24v power supply. 

the errors you are encountering are due to missing u8g libraries. they should be in the arduino addon folder in the same archive.

before you continue with anything, what printer do you have?"
"starts, stops, interrupts and cloning","i attempted to print 12 small cups about 45mm diameter by loading the .stl file 12 times into slic3r. i noticed when the print started, that the printer would stop frequently, like it was processing, and then start up again a few seconds later. it did this throughout the print and the hips left a little blob everytime it hesitated.  finally, about 75% to completion, the printer hung completely with the tip touching one of the cups.  i'm asssuming that either the processor in the pc or the printer just couldn't handle the way i processed the gcode.  is there a recommended way to create an array of multiple, identical shapes, or was this just something perhaps tying up the pc resources?  it is not a dedicated machine. i'm trying the same print with just 5 cups and it's working better. 


mike","check if you are running a 64 bit operating system, and if so, double your ram and try again. windows 7 as is will be using most of that system ram. depending on which i5 processor you have (specifically the dual core or the quad core) that could definitely be a contributing factor. also make sure your power settings are set to ""high performance"" as the default ""balanced""  power scheme will try and turn your usb ports off if it thinks they are idle. i've noticed windows 7 can't always tell if repetier is using the port on a few systems. prointerface is probably similar in how it handles that connection. 

also, you are overextruding quite a bit for some reason. could be specified filliament size, could be moisture in the filliament, could be partially the circle issue in the older .9x versions of slic3r. try upgrading to one of the 1.x revisions of slic3r, and check your filliament diameter against what you have specified for filliament size in slic3r and see if there is a difference"
taz 2.1 -  extruder jam all the time.,"i bought my taz 2.1 for almost 2 months ago and have problems with it.

when it print, then the plastic wire stucks. 

trying to explain:
when the printer move the head to another position, then the  extruder running a little backwards to brake the plastic, 
then is running forwards again, and that´s where the plastic stucks and nothing comes out.
the extruder axel just make a hole in the plastic thread. 

how can i fix this? 

hot end is not blocked, because i can easily press the plastic thru manually. 

i hope there is someone who possesses a good one, for it fails in every print.

kind regards
jan - denmark","i had the same issue.  i didn't notice the issue until i was doing very small parts which had a lot of retracts or when trying to prime the extruder with large manual runs on pronterface.  the root cause came to light when doing triffid hunters calibration proceedure- i noticed the 100mm marks on the filament stalling every revolution of the extruder gears.  his proceedure mentions removing the nozzle so it isn't a restriction but i left it on and i was exceeding the capabilties of the extruder with the extruder speed.  i suspected that the extruder can only melt so much material so fast or pressure builds up to the point of stalling the filament which causes the grinding at the hobbed bolt.  once this happens you have to stop, clean the hobbed bolt very thoroughly, and slow the extruder speeds down.

1) after doing everything that piercet mentions set the spring tension to a 6mm gap.  i use a 6mm allen wrench to measure the distance between the washers.  
2) i slowed the extruder retraction speed down in the slicer advanced settings and also the extrusion speed on pronterface.
3) since you are using lulzbot abs i wouldn't suspect the diameter to be bigger then the insert in the budaschnozzle.  i run jet abs and had to open up the insert to accomodate the larger diameter filament.  this too was an issue for me but probably isn't for you.

  i haven't had any issues since i've done this.  i just finished a 11 hour print yesterday that came out  perfect.  the taz is capable of doing exceptional work on long arduous runs.  it sometimes is a painful learning curve though.  hope that helps."
taz hardware list,"is there or can there be a handy parts list for the taz, possibly tagged to a diagram or something?  would love not sounding like a idiot when i go to the hardware store(yes i realize thats on me lol).  hell send me the list and i might be able to compile it if needed but this could be a handy resource for everyone i think.",you want the bom - bill of materials from here: http://download.lulzbot.com/taz/3.0/production_docs/ that should have most of it. chances are your local hardware store won't have the t-slot nuts and heat set inserts. your best bet for those is ordering from mcmaster carr.
z axis  centimeter on home?,"it states in the guide...
once lowered by approximately 1cm, press the home z button to home the
z axis. the hot end will approach the heated bed and should stop around a
centimeter above the surface of the heated bed

is this right????? are you sure you dont mean a millimeter? i only ask because a centimeter (which is 10mm) is quite some distance from the bed, certainly not a height which is just above a piece of paper.","it's a conservative safety check! since the firmware is set to not allow manual movements in the negative direction until that axis has been homed, we want to ensure that when it does so, it does so safely.

by making the first z axis homing movement stop rather high above the bed, we're making sure that the z axis homing setting has not been changed during shipping/assembly, so that the hot end does not try to push past the bed, potentially damaging the hot end, the glass bed or something else.."
clarification on z axis nozzle height,"i am reading the manual located at 
http://download.lulzbot.com/taz/documen ... -ebook.pdf

on pages 93-94 it states...

the image to the right, in figure 5.3,
is the correct nozzle height. the nozzle should not be pushing down on the
print surface

however the image on the right is showing the nozzle pressed directly against the bed.  the nozzle picture on the left is the one which is just above the bed.  so which is right and which is wrong, is this an error in the manual and it was supposed to be the image to the left is the correct nozzle height.

i was always under the impression to take a card or paper. slide it under the nozzle, it should be just low enough that i can slide the paper out.  if pressed down one more and it cannot be moved then i have gone too far.  so basically lower it as much as possible where u can still slide it out.

is this correct?","your understanding is correct. thing of an extruder just like a garden hose. if you turn on the hose but block the end, no water comes out. for an extruder, a blocked nozzle means that it starts chewing up the filliament instead. if you are too low you can even damage your heater bed tape. the other thing to keep in mind is that your nozzle wil get slightly longer at full operating temperature. if you calibrate it cold, you will be too close when it warms. i  find that the little 150mm ruler that came with my ao-100 is just about the ideal thickness for the nozzle height, and it's fireproof!

too high from the bed and your extruded plastic comes out round, not squished at all, like an ""0"" the bottom of that ""0"" is a very small surface area compared to the overall width, so it doesn't stick. you want it squished down a bit to adhere well and have the right shape. if you squish it too much then the layer starts too thin and causes issues above it."
can i leave in my unheated garage?,"i do all my work in my garage. my garage is unheated however it is insulated, so it never drops below 38-40 degrees. 

is this ok? or does the lulzbot need to be kept in a warmer environment. 

i ask this question in two part, one in operation and one in storage. so in other words can it be this cool in storage but i would use a space heater nearby in operation, or neither, etc 

thank you","a really good example of an enxlosure is the one in this thread: http://forum.lulzbot.com/viewtopic.php?f=36&t=177

basically an enclosure is just a box, prefferably insulated, to keep hot air around your printer. the simplist ones can be made of cardboard boxes. if you build an enclosure, make sure to locate the controller board and the power supply outside it so you don't melt them.  generally the heat from the printer itself will be sufficient. some poeple have had varying luck using infrared heater lamps.

http://youtu.be/g7ebfnm4bkq

andy","i can't verify that for you as these are my taz 2 settings and don't have the ao100. you can try and see where it takes you.

easy steps to find your numbers:
- set acceleration max limits to ~5000 not to limit you.
- set acceleration to ~1000 to find maximum speed values. (value needs to be high enough to reach max speed in the 100mm movement)
- work with one axis at a time. i start with x, then y. z and e needs different units since the gear ratio is a lot different but the steps are the same.

each axis:
- set velocity maximum to ~100mm/s, then make the axis move 100mm then -100mm with 500mm/s feedrate from pronterface. repeat this movement a couple times for consistency. (i did this with the encoder knob since manual machine movements will use these maximums)
- increase speed until the machine is able to make the movement without getting stuck, making a loud noise and loose steps.
- take the lowest velocity setting that starts flaking out, take 80% of that and make it your axis vmax.
- on the same axis do the same with acceleration. increase it until the motor gets stuck, then back off 20%.
- jerk values won't make the machine skip, you can adjust that for a bit smoother operation. (jerk is how fast you're acceleration turns on)

do the same for your other axis: test movement <-> increase speed --> test movement <-> increase acceleration, until the machine is fast, but never skips."
x and y axis belt mounts with adjustable tension,"







i was never happy with the belt mounts in the stock configuration. the clamps seemed to slip and adjusting the tension, with any measure of precision, was also pretty difficult. after much trial and error, i have come up with a solution for each axis and they are both working out very well. i have posted them on thingiverse: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:215340 and http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:215375. sorry for the unclear pictures, if i were thinking ahead i would have printed the pieces in different colors. if anyone has any critiques or tweaks, i would love to see!",that's a great idea! nicely done! are the mounting holes compatible with existing taz bed plates?
lcd resetting itself,"i have been experiencing very frequent disconnects from the computer, then tonight on about the 5th or 6th disconnect just trying to get the bed up to temp i noticed that right before the disconnect, the lcd restarted itself showing the startup screen and the right after the computer in printrun, showed that i was disconnected.  i thought to myself maybe i should try to flash the firmware, but when i went to the support/downloads/guides/re-flashing your 3d printer's firmware/taz 2.1 there was an error message that ""the requested url /taz/2.1/software/2013q4/firmware/marlin_taz/marlin_taz.tar.bz2 was not found on this server.""  i went into the source area in index of /taz/2.1/software/2013q4/firmware/marlin_taz/marlin but there were so many files i was not sure what to grab. the guide talks about getting the esteps info from the printed sheets that came with the machine. is it the number that is hand written on the first page of the test/acceptance record packet under steps/mm in e0 row? i don't want to do this wrong and end up worse of than i was before, any help would be greatly appreciated.","is the lcd resetting at random intervals? does removing the sd card help with it's stability? there's two wiring harnesses attached to the back of the lcd controller assembly. you'll want to make sure that they are both firmly seated into the lcd controller.

we're in the middle of updating our download section and packaging up some firmware files. the archive linked should be there later today once everything gets synced over. 

while you certainly can reflash your firmware, i don't think it will help, as it's not really going to go out without something else happening. email support@lulzbot.com if the lcd controller keeps resetting, or if the connection keeps getting lost in pronterface and we'll go further indepth to see what's going on and what needs to occur.

the firmware files at the link you mentioned are all needed, you can download them one at a time, or use a download manager/wget/curl to download the entire directory. 

the value needed from your test acceptance sheet is the e0 value, which is your steps per unit for the extruder. copy that value into the line mentioned, following the same format.

i would hold off on flashing the firmware for now, until you're/we're sure it's not a hardware issue."
small repeating blob on inner perimiters,"i've had a really  fairly minor issue with my prints for a while now. basically any time i print something that has an inner hole, the place where the nozzle starts and stops on that hole tends to have a tiny bit of extra material extruded. it doesn't seem to do it so much on the outer perimiter. it generally does it every layer, at pretty much the exact same spots, one per hole usually, though occasionally for some reason i can't explain, i'll get two of them in some holes. the extruder itself is pretty much 100% dialed in, i extrude 100mm filliament, the filliament moves 100mm, the first layer height appears to be fairly good on average, and the correct thickness of the first layer does not seem to have an effect on the issue. a smaller hole is more likely to have the issue occur. typically the little blobs will be stacked on top of eachother all the way up the hole in that same spot. 

any ideas what is going on or how to fix it? i'm thinking it has something to do with retraction on permiter start or stopincreasing or decreasing the number of perimiters has no effect. randomize starting points doesn't seem to help, though typically it enters the inner perimiters in the same spot even with that on. right now retraction is at 1mm, retract on layer change, and minimum travel after retraction 2mm. wipe before retract is not enabled. i'm not even sure what that one does. printing with a .5mm nozzle, standard .5mm settings from lulzbot, etc.

am i on the right track, or is this something else entirely? potentially something related to the budaschnozzle 1.0 design itself that isn't present in newer ones? 

it's a fairly minor issue and easy to clean up, but i'd like to get it working correctly if i can. thanks!","hello!
what slic3r version are you using? you might want to try with the 1.0.0rc2 version that i just released (find it at http://slic3r.org). if you have been using 0.9.10b it could just be caused by an old bug in there.

if you're using 1.0.0rc1 or 1.0.0rc2, i would then look at the g-code closely with a preview program like pronterface. is there anything visible in the inner holes where the printed object has the said blobs? if there is, it's a toolpath issue and we could proceed troubleshooting together. if there isn't, and the holes look round and smooth with no artifacts, it's usually a matter of temperature and/or retraction speed and/or retraction length.

let me know how it goes. "
second layer blues,"i have been experiencing an issue with the second layer of a print.  i have a failure rate of 75% where the first layer apparently is created correctly but the second layer fails to extrude anything.  this always happens when the layer height is set to less than 0.3mm or i am attempting to print with pla.  pla has a 0% success rate.

i have tried increasing the extruder temperature and slowing down the print, but so far, nothing.  i figure that the problem is that the pressure on the extruder is too high, but i do not know what to do about it.  

i have performed a few tests with extrusion and retraction using the buttons on printrun.  i set the length to 15mm and attempted extrusion, but only ~7mm fed.  i retracted, and 15mm retracted, then i extruded, and 15mm extruded (well, fed into the extruder).  i then attempted to extrude again and only got ~7mm.  this is fairly consistent.  i was able to get pla to extrude 15mm consistently by setting the temp (for pla) to 220 and the extrusion rate to 50mm/s.  for abs, the temp is 240 and the extrusion rate is 50mm/s as well.  

i have attempted to slow the prints down, but it only works for ""draft"" (i.e., 0.30mm+ layer heights) prints using abs.  everything else results in print failure.

any ideas or suggestions?","can you print the lulzbot octopus from the gcode with pla?

http://download.lulzbot.com/taz/novelties/

i've been able to get a part that small working fine with pla, but once the part is much bigger (particularly with a large solid layer), i get failures pretty fast with the stock taz.  i ended up using scott's fan mount and that combined with increased temp got me up and running for printing big parts.  

you can see the fan mount here:
http://forum.lulzbot.com/viewtopic.php? ... 9&start=10

and get the stl for the mount here:
http://forum.lulzbot.com/viewtopic.php?f=36&t=202

my pla extrudes fine at 180c when just extruding into the air, but i found i needed to use 195c whenever i was printing bigger parts.  of course, when i do that, i start getting heat creep which is when i had to start using the fan mount.  before, i was getting a failure as early as the second layer of my prints, but i finished a 5 hour print just the other day using the higher temp + fan combo.

one other thing to check is your idler tension.  if you pull the filament out after a print fails, is there a little half moon carved out?  if so, it's probably tight enough, but you may need the higher temp and/or fans.  if there isn't a gouge, then your idler may not be gripping tight enough so you'll want to tighten it down a bit.  i ended up backing my idler off one full turn on each screw (from the tightness i use for abs) - i don't know if that actually helped my prints, but the print worked so it didn't hurt.

one other tip some users suggested is turning off retraction entirely.  you'll get more ooze that way, but if your filament is getting stripped by the hobbed bolt turning retraction off may help.  i didn't have a lot of success with this (the print might have gotten a little further, but never successfully finished), but it's worth a try.

taz 3 bed upgrade kit,"i just saw the announcement of the taz 3 (including the new power supply & better heater for the bed):

https://www.lulzbot.com/?q=products/lul ... 3d-printer

are you guys going to offer an upgrade kit for taz 1 & 2 owners so we can move to the more reliable & consistently heated bed?  if so, any idea on the timing and or pricing for it?

- adam","cpedicini wrote:can you tell me why i would want to upgrade from the taz version 2.1 printer ?  also, i see the present method of mounting the borosilicate glass is done with a 4 point mount.  i would think a 3 point mount with the mounts closer to the center of the table would be more accurate for maintaining the print.  thoughts ?

the 3.0 bed is 24v and heats up faster than the 12v. both are using 4 point mounting. three-point mounting may be used in future releases.

enlarging a taz?,"has anyone tried to increase the x and y dimensions of a taz?  it would require longer pieces of extrusion, longer belts, and a heated table rework.  i have a student who would like to print an electric guitar body and it just isn't going to fit.
thanks,","making the heated bed much bigger would really increase the mass on the y axis, which would make prints slower and somewhat less accurate. you could fix the accuracy by going with a supported linear rail, and the speed by going with a larger motor and bigger belts, but at some point you would be better off looking at making a moving y axis gantry and leaving the bed stationary, especially with that much plastic sitting on it. you would probably end up installing two heat beds next to eachother with a single piece of longer glass on top, which would mean a second power supply.

increasing the x direction would just be belts, frame pieces and bearing rods unless you also wanted to widen the heated bed

you could also look at printing the guitar body in stages with interlocking tabs that you could later glue together."
lulzbot customer support in need of an upgrade :-(,"hi folks:

i'm just venting a little and want to warn those who need to use the lulzbot customer support.....woe to you.

i purchased a new taz 2.0 from recommendations from friends, and then waited patiently for more than 2 months for it to arrive.  that did not bother me too much, as i know that quality 3d printers are in high demand and i expected to wait that long.  however, i was hoping to at least get an email to update me on the status of the order.  i did not........until i had to write and ask.  

finally i get the taz 2.0 printer, and 4 or 5 reels of filament and i'm ready to print.  i successfully printed a few prints over 2 days, and then the heated bed failed to heat up to the correct temperature.  i called customer service, and sent the defective bed back, and through tracking knew that it arrived safely.  i waited a few days, waiting for the email response ""that it arrived, we are looking at it, etc, etc""......but again, nothing..........until i sent another email asking about the update.

another 3 weeks go by and finally get an email saying that lulzbot customer service is shipping me a new heater bed.  i am excited until i find out that they have shipped it to austraila......and i am located in indiana usa.  i emailed them and ask them to please ship me a new heater bed to the correct address, or at least tell me how to purchase another one.  again.....no response back.

so at this point, i don't expect too much from them anymore and have basically given up.  i've heard that the printer is excellent, but i can't give my opinion because i have a $2000 paper weight sitting where a 3d printer should be.  i've told the folks at work who are looking for a printer to look elsewhere, and the same on other forums.

sorry if this sounds negative, but all i want to do is start printing, and not have to wait anymore.

ross","the last email i see from you to support@lulzbot.com was four days ago and we replied three days ago with:

""hello ross,
the package has been rerouted to proper address! i will send the updated tracking information once it is available. i am sorry for any inconveniences you may have experienced and hope to get your printer up and running as quick as possible. if i can help with anything else, please let me know!""

we didn't follow up with the actual tracking number until now though, sorry about that. it is en route. did you get that email? there may have been other discussion outside of the trouble ticketing system too.

i do see you emailed our cto directly (?), but i'm not sure what the scoop is there, but presumably it wasn't about this.

taz 2 vs taz 3?,"hello everyone,

i've been following the taz printers closely and finally ordered the taz 2 at the beginning of this month. it hasn't shipped yet, but now i see it isn't even for sale anymore. on top of that, the taz 3 is the only offered printer.

is it worth canceling my taz 2 order for the taz 3? i heard they have been ramping up production in the last few weeks to meet current orders. does this mean they are shipping out a bunch of taz 2s right now?

seems odd to be dropping >$2k on something that doesn't even have a product page  ...","we have some more details in this thread:

http://forum.lulzbot.com/viewtopic.php? ... 3&start=20"
taz 2 nozzle temps over 240c,"i'm wanting to play with some glow in the dark abs, but the extrusion temp is listed at 250c.  i know from reading the forums that the buddaschnozzle on the taz2 will have problems over 240c.  my question is what needs to be modified to allow for higher heat?

i see an upgrade kit for the earlier nozzles for higher heat.  is 2.0c similar?","i've actually got an older machine, it started out life as an ao-100, though now it's fairly close to a taz in terms of mechanicals. what i am planning on doing in my case is convert the budaschnozle 1.0 nozzle that came with the machine to a polyschnozzle with the kit, since it will fit, and then purchase a seperate 2.0 budaschnozzle or 3 for other printings.  i've installed a ""quick fit"" compliant quick disconnect carriage in my machine so i can swap out print head assemblies and i'll be putting a serial db9 or db-16 connection in line on the wire harness so i can add and remove assemblies as needed. given the amount of wiring putting a new nozzle on a machine requires, that seems to be the easiest way to make nozzle changes feasable in a quick amount of time. i'll run a second wire harness eventually when i build the dual extruder setup. i have a few printer upgrade design projects and holliday printing in process before i go messing too much with the electrical connections

there are other nozzles out there, though the lulzbot one seems to be one of the more reliable and consistant ones. do a search for ""all metal extruder hot ends"" and you'll be able to see some of the variations. you can generally find a greg wades accessable extruder style carriage (what the taz and the ao-10x series uses) to fit most any hot end if you feel like experementing."
bad first layers,"i've been noticing the first 3 layers or so have a strange rippling on some of my prints. this happens on all my taz's (3 of them) at one time or another. i just finished upgrading the x and z axis parts and replaced the polymer bearings with ball bearing ones on one printer but it's still there.




","take a look at the automatic bed leveling upgrade that 1013 made for a possible fix. the root cause of initial layer weirdness is usually caused by a couple of factors, mainly stemming from the nozzle distance from the bed. you may have the nozzle slightly too close or too far away, which is  either causing the outer perimeter to not conform to the shape it actually thinks it is, or in the case of it being too close, causes it to build up plastic in the extruder and overextrude on the perimeter. as the unit goes up in layers, either condition tends to resolve itself. the problem is that the length of the nozzle changes depending on how warm the metal is. assuming you are printing in a room that is the same temperature, you will still get a different height result from printing when the sensor in the hot end says 230 degrees c (f0r abs) vs what you would see if you let it sit at 230 degrees for 10 minutes, because in that ten minutes the nozzle actually got 1/10th of a mm longer than what you dialed it in at.  if any of your bed corners are even slightly out of level that can also compound the issue. 

additional leveling, only printing after the machine is fully up to temperature, really tight belts, extra perimiters, and ensuring your extruder is dialed in perfectly can all help with initial layer quality. or you can print with a brim and just assume trimming will be required"
replacement electronics switch,"my bed stopped heating recently. the bed heat fuse was fine, but i traced the problem back to the switch. one of the wires looked burned badly (see attached). i need to replace the switch, does anyone have a part number? i looked on the bom and it just says digikey 1473 which doesn't narrow it down for me.. thanks!

i was able to get it back working by bypassing the switch temporarily.","hey there, if you're printer is under warranty, the part should be able to be replaced. otherwise the part numbers are: for the switch 1091-1017-nd and for the quick connects a27824-nd."
broken part,on my new taz 2 the part in the picture has split. what is this part called and are there any gcode file on this part that i could print with the standard nozzle.,"that is the ""z nut spring"" and can be printed with the .5 nozzle
stl and gcode are here:
http://download.lulzbot.com/taz/2.1/pro ... spring_m6/ 

you will need to heat set inserts into it with a soldering iron to make it work. you can reuse the existing heat set inserts if you can extract them from your existing broken spring. 

that particular part should not have failed on any pf the taz 2's yet though either. print one to get yourself back up and running, but i would also contact customer service if i were you and have them send you a new retail one as well as it should be under warranty still. 

there is also a dual nut upgraded variant by 1013 that you can find in the development threads or on thingiverse if you decide to upgrade that particular part since you have to print one anyways."
heatbed won't reach proper temperature,"i'm trying to set my heatbed to 110 degrees, but it will only reach ~ 92 and not go any higher.

is there something wrong, or is it just too cold in my basement?","the taz heatbed doesn't need to go to 110 degrees. it should be set at 85 for proper operation. it's a different design than the ao-10x series ones and the thinner circuit board means the temperature sensor reads a lower temperature than the same sensor did on the thicker ao-10x board that had more material between the hot bit and the sensor. try printing at 85 and see if things stick. there is a typo in the manual that says 110 still for the taz, there is a thread about it stickied somewhwere in here. 

if you have an ao-10x instead, ignore all that and you might have a bad thermristor or heat bed"
what's up with these noisy fans??!?!,"just got my taz 2 in the mail and it's a beauty. but really, what's up with these noisy fans?   

my last ao-101 fanmod http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:47321 was made by printing a new lid, but the control box on the taz was not really made for modding. so i soldered a 3w 100 ohm resistor to the fan lead instead. (1w would probably have been enough, but this was all i had)

the speed and airflow seems fine and the noise is gone.

for part 2 i will be trying to tune the stepper for more quite operation, has anyone tried this on the taz?




","the only stepper noise reduction i've seen attempted is placing a layer of damping material between the nema motors and the frame, and adding vibration isolation feet to the unit."
extruder fan help!,"have in stalled 40 mm 12 v fan for pla printing.  fan appeared to work for a bit, but now after a few prints with it it will not turn.  have done the following as a test.

- slic3r ""fan always on"" at 75% = no good
- gcode m106 s193 at start of print = no good
- tested fan with 7.2 v battery pack with current of 56 ma = fan spins great
- multimeter to terminals on rambo = 9.2 v at 75%
- multimeter test of current on rambo = 12 ma  

is the lower amperage my problem and if so how do i fix.  have replaced the fuse already thinking that was a problem.","in any printer host software, that would run on a separate computer (printrun, repetier-host, etc) you can send manual gcode commands. in pronterface (printrun) in the lower right hand side of the screen you can send the following command ""m106 s123"" to turn on the fan, at 50% speed. if you are using the graphical lcd controller, you would simply use the menu entries."
look at this cool thing i made!!,"so, obviously i wasn't watching when this occured, but i'm sure the part detached from the bed.  it was laying on the table next to the printer. i used the abs/acetone solution prior to starting the print.  is there a setting in slic3r or pronterface that i should adjust?  also, the part i made before this one was a large, squareish, flat piece and 3 of the corners curled up from the bed by the time it was done. abs natural, nozzle 230c, bed 85c, taz 2, any advice welcome, very newbie.","the first layer is very similar to the middle one, although the bed could probably be raised just a tiny bit.  i tried the print again, and it curled up on the corner and then one of the legs detached, so it would appear there is still something not quite right. i'm wondering if maybe a 90% fill is too much, or if 0.1 layer height is too thin, or some other setting would cause the corners to lift and curl.  i  am using the abs/acetone mix as recommended, applied to a cold bed with a paper towel so it leaves an even film. i tried to attach the gcode file to the forum but it kept locking."
plowing on 0.15 layer for some areas,"i'm using the planetary gear model as a reference (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:23030/#files), specifically the part at scale 150% which holds the 3 planet gears in place with 3 thin shafts. when printing at 0.15 layer height the base comes out beautifully but as it comes to the thin shafts it appears to spit out a too much filament then proceeds to plow the head through the excess plastic.

i'm using all the slic3r configuration files with the same results. it still happens with default slic3r settings with 0.3 layer height but it's less obivous.
i have tried to reducing solid and top solid infil extrusion width to prevent the extra squirt on the fine shaft, and increasing the distance in my z end stop to give it some extra space to the point where the first layer hardly sticks on the bed.

what other options do i have besides printing at 200% scale?

i've added some photos and this video where it seems to be too low https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dckghz8bhu","printing a few on a plate to allow it to cool more will help for fine ""spire"" like parts.
do you mean print 3 or 4 together so that by the time it comes back to the first part the previous layer would have cooled a little?

i played with some settings and getting some straighter shafts on my last print. there were still some plowing which i think caused the roughness or gaps. looking at the photos can anybody tell me if this is acceptable at 0.15 layer height? how much better could i expect on these shafts considering they are 10mm high and 4mm wide?

(slic3r config attached)
i changed infill every 2 to 5 layers.
advanced extrusion width:
 extrusion width .315 to .2,
 first layer .315 to .2,
 infill .3 to .2

 top solid infill .3 to .2"
hobbed bolt and extruder have ~2mm offset,"basically, if you draw a centerline down the center of the hobbed bolt's teeth, it misses the center hole down which the filament must pass in order to reach the hot end.  the offset is about 2mm, which is significant since the filament is only 3mm in diameter.  

the bodded bolt is set up in the following manner:  large gear --> three ""large"" washers --> one ""small"" washer --> bearing --> printed frame --> bearing --> ""large"" washer --> locking nut.

since i do not wish to cause more harm than good, i have refrained from attempting a f ix on my own.  i believe that another washer should be added to the ""stack"" of four washers in order to shift the hobbed bolt into alignment.

any suggestions?","i have done my best to align the hobbed bolt assembly properly.  i have had to do the following:
      1. disassemble the hobbed bolt assembly.
      2. remove slop from over extrusion in the bearing housing area.
      3. reorder and replace washers to align the hobbed bolt assembly.
      4. loosen the set screw that attaches the small gear from the stepper motor in order to align the small gear with the large gear.
       5. repair delaminates elements in the gears caused by misalignment of the gears.

i put it all back together and while it is not perfect, it is definitely better."
bent threaded rod,"one of the rods of my taz 2.1 arrived slightly bent.  i cannot detect any issues save a wobbly and an annoying humm when moving the z axis rapidly.  during normal operation, i cannot detect any issues -- no change in leveling, no vibration, etc.

is this something that i should still have replaced?  or should i leave well enough alone?","if you are concerned about the threaded rod we'd be happy to take a look at it. i would recommend taking a photograph if possible, from right above the threaded rod looking as straight down the threaded rod shaft as you can manage. a little bit of play on the free end is acceptable as the z axis nuts on the x axis ends are isolated. one big debate in the reprap 3d printing world, is whether constrained z axis threaded rods help or hinder printer operation and quality. an obvious bend in the threaded rod is not something that should normally happen though. once you get some photographs, please send them to support@lulzbot.com with your order information and anything thing else you may have questions on.

hobbed bolt chewing through abs on taz 0.15 layer height,"i have the 0.35 nozzle and printing at 0.3 layer height works great. it's when i print with 0.15 layer height using lulzbot high quality slic3r profile i get prints that start out great and by about halfway through the filament stops extruding. 
also throughout the print there is a different sound on retraction, when i open the filament idler the hobbed bolt has chewed into the filament.

i'd don't believe there is a blockage as i've soaked the nozzle in acetone for a few hours (it was pretty clean anyway) and my 0.3 layer height prints always turn out fine.

i haven't touched anything in the high quality slic3r profile, should i try reducing the extrusion speed? would i be correct in thinking to print smaller layer heights the extruder would have to work faster with the filament?","usually with a wades extruder, chewing through filliament is a sign that your extruder is trying to extrude more material than the available space will accept, with that small of a layer height spacing, if your extruder isn't dialed in 100% it can start backing up pressure, which causes the filliament to not feed as fast as the machine thinks it is, causing it to strip and making your print unhappy. you can try a few things. first, make sure you have the filliament diameter as accurately measured as you can with a caliper and enter that into your printing software. you can then try either backing off on the speed, or the amount of extrusion slightly until the issue seems to go aeay. or you can slightly increase the layer height to .17 or something around there and see if that does the trick. 

with a smaller layer height, the available space for material is less. the extruder actually needs to feed slower so it doesn't overpressure the molten filliament chamber, not faster. that or the head needs to move faster to deposit plastic ahead of the pressure, but that leads to lower quality prints."
hot end fail,"my brand-new taz2 was doing fine thru the first four or five printing runs.

prepping for the next run, everything seemed ok, but the hot-end failed to heat.  electronics box fan, bed heating, and x-y-z motion all normal.

what i did:

1) quit and relaunched macpronterface  (mar2012 -- latest version doesn't work) -- no help
2) cycled power  (off --wait 10sec-- on) -- no help
3) unplugged and replugged the 6pin connector above the hot-end -- no help
4) on the rambo,  removed and tested f3  -- it is intact.   
5) on the rambo,  just for grins, removed and tested f2 and f4  -- both are intact.   
6) on the rambo, after i command hot-end to 185c, led2 glows strongly.

<visual: scratching head>","thanks for your replies:

cabbage_breath:  yeah, that would definitely be a next step, but i was a bit reluctant to mess with the circuitry, lacking a system connection schematic.   i found plenty of docs about the rambo, but perhaps i overlooked material that shows what's connected to the rambo on the taz2.  such a document might usefully include brief advice such as equivalent circuits, e.g. ""disconnect here, test with an ohmmeter, expect n ohms across a to b.""   did i just totally miss a document like this?

jebba:   thanks, that's a wonderful offer.  glad it is not going to be necessary, as...

after some 7) head-scratching, i continued my trouble-shooting as follows:

8) eyeballed the termination at  connecter x11, saw two red wires to that point stretched taut <sound effect: warning buzzer> across the interior of the electronics box.
9) pulled the connector, loosened the 2 screws, examined wire stripped ends, re-seated wires, tightened screws.
10) tested hot-end.  hot!   and ok in 2 following prints.

a potential intermittent open-circuit:  the wire clamps at the x11 mating connector appeared to be clamped mainly on the insulation. maybe that's ok, maybe they are intended to clamp on both insulation and stripped wire ends --i'm not familiar with these connectors --  but in any case, re-seating the wires seems to restore hot-end heating.  and restored some slack on those wires.

so...  problem appears solved.  thanks very much!"

i don't know that you'll find a nice step by step guide yet, but there are two good threads on here you'll be interested in:

http://forum.lulzbot.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=145

you can get the stl files for the printed parts of some of the dual extruder options there, but you'll still need to track down the other hardware you need to actually assemble everything.  at the first link, bam mentioned that lulzbot is thinking about a drop in dual extruder kit...no timeline though.

taz 2.0 manufacturered parts?,"still digging through the fragmented build documentation for the taz printer.

it seems that taz 2.0 replaced several printed parts (frame connectors and z-top) with machined parts. obviously this must have been done to increase stability of the printer. 

is there anyone out there selling these parts? i see lulzbot sells the y-carriage, but these other machined parts don't appear to be in the catalog.","cassetti wrote:it seems that taz 2.0 replaced several printed parts (frame connectors and z-top) with machined parts. obviously this must have been done to increase stability of the printer. 
why ""obviously""? i rather think it was done to allow production scaling. printing parts takes time and lulzbot can't meet with demand.

another example is the electronics enclosure which is now made of sheet metal. the original taz printed electronics enclosure required a huge amount of plastic and must have taken forever to print.

for a self-sourced taz i don't see why go to the trouble of sourcing machined parts, it might be easier (and maybe cheaper?) to have them printed."
bearing failure on printer head,"after only 2 months, this bearing failed - the one on the shaft that pulls the filament to the nozzle.  i emailed support on this too.

can someone tell me the bearing part number since i need to get this printer up for a project due this week.  sorry this pic is rotated 90 degrees ccw.






brian","you have a bunch of plastic shavings there, and that bearing isn't a sealed unit. what i would do if i were you, is take the extruder apart adn remove all three bearings, then spray them down with some wd-40 to try and blow loose the plastic chunks that are probably inside that rear nonsealed bearing. also take the time to clean any plastic out of the hobbed bolt at the same time with a small wire brush or a pick. chances are the bearing itself is fine. even 2 months solid 24 hour a day, 7 day a week running shouldn't put that bearing anywhere near failure point."
"taz vs. ultimaker, series 1, m2...","taz owners: what was your deciding factor for choosing a taz?

i'm a total noob getting ready to buy my first 3d printer.  i've been digging through endless amounts of information to distill down the choices, but having no practical experience it is hard to know what's important and what's not, and i'd like to hear from those with taz experience how it compares to other printers in the market.  as yet, i have found no direct comparison tests.

i'm looking forward to printing and tweaking airplanes, helis, etc with my 4 kids.  it seems like the durability of abs is the way to go, but very large, thin, and flat things like wings appear especially difficult to print without warping.  i'm a pc tech by training, so a little tinkering doesn't scare me, but saving time is important - pre-assembled is a plus.

so far the taz is my front runner, but i wonder how it compares to other printers?  others on my list are the ultimaker, type a series 1, or makergear m2.

thoughts?","sometimes it's hard to understand the value of open software/hardware until you see it in action. improvements in all kinds of things happen so quickly and files fly around the net. progress can happen amazingly fast. if project leaders are good, improvements rapidly find their way back to the project ""mainline."" not every open project is a success - far from it - but it helps your odds. you're not just depending on the company being great.

there are other good open printers out there too. taz looked both well-designed and extremely versatile to me - though i'm self-conscious about making any claims, i'm not an expert. it just looked like an easy path to many materials, and to both very big/fast or small/high-detail prints. other good alternatives like ultimaker weren't offering heated beds at the time i chose, though they do now, with the ultimaker 2. 

as far as i know, no one is making fdm printers that are ""fire and forget"" - everything at this stage requires an investment in time to experiment, tinker and troubleshoot. maybe some smaller, lower resolution printers are easier overall, but that didn't seem as interesting to me personally.

you should visit hackerspaces and public events like a maker faire where you can see what you'd be buying and ideally talk to people who use various printers face to face, if you can. that's always fun and i think the best way."
"unsure of cause, help?","hey gang!

i just recently received my taz2, and have been working with it for a little over a week trying to sort out the one issue i'm having. i'm posting this under hardware because i _think_ it's a hardware issue, but it's strange enough that if it's not, i'm hoping someone can move the thread.

i have a model that i built (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:110721) and that's i've printed several of on a makerbot replicator 1 in pla at .2mm layers at 190 degrees. they print uniformly awesome on the makerbot...solid, clean, all the lines sharp and the most important bit (the rails for the lid (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:110710) are clean and strong. when i print the two pieces, they slide together perfectly.

but not on my taz. i'm up to about 8 prints of the box, trying a variety of different settings. i've tried .1mm layers, .2mm layers, 200 degrees, 190 degrees. the bed seems to be dead level...i don't have any issue with sticking/peeling, the bottom layer is great. what's not great is the top layer, which is a wreck. the top 10 or so layers are just terrible, stringy. it looks like the very top layer isn't even printing properly, because you can see into the structure on some of the prints, like the tops layers just aren't being printed. the top layer is stringy, to the point where the rails of the lid are just loose threads, not even solid.   

i'm slicing directly in the newest version of slic3r, all my settings look right as far as temperature, diameter of filament, etc, and then loading and printing from the sd card. i'm beginning to think this is related to all the pla difficulty that people are having with the taz, given that it's late in the print that things start falling apart....it's about a 2.5 hour print at .2 layers and 50% fill, which seems pretty short to have that much heat creep, but it very well could be. 

if anyone has any thoughts, i'm all ears. it's driving me batty. 

thanks!","huh, that is wierd. what is especially wierd is that after it starts having problems, one half of the duct continued to print fine, the other had no extrusion at all. if it were heat creap, i would expect the whole thing to plug up at that point. what it looks like you have to me is a condition where for whatever reason the extruder gear is not able to advance the filliamen when the nozzle hits that halfway point. you had a similar issue further down too, but it corrected itself the next layer. i suspect that you are losing traction in that direction because the idler screws on the extruder are too loose, and the momentum of the extruder is causing the hobbed bolt to lose traction for a bit. maybe coupled with some shavings in there? if i were you, i would start with the nema 17 motor, make sure the small gear is on and set tightly, make sure the motor is coupled to the mount securely, and that the controll wires look intact. i'd then open up the idler chamber to check for any filliament shavings, and clean that out especially well. i'd then re tension the idler to make sure it has good tension and then try again. if it still has issues after that, it has to be controller, nozzle, or heat creap related. 

you might also try slowing the print down considerably and watching to see if any of the extruder components aren't working correctly. 

i had a similar issue related to that smaller gear on the nema motor set screw coming loose once on my ao-100."
heat resistor dead at 3 months,"just wanted to record this for those who may encounter this problem.

i had been printing for about 3 months with a batch one taz when the extruder stopped heating yet the thermistor read correctly. the likely source of the problem was diagnosed with a helpful claudio from lulzbot support over the phone using a multimeter.

definitely consider keeping a few extra heat resistors on hand as this problem will surely occur at the worst time possible, as it did for me.

3 months of regular printing seems short, but i'm new to 3d printing and this could be normal.

an aside, i ordered the replacement part on a friday am with expre$$ shipping from lulzbot and didn't receive until wednesday afternoon, not quick enough for me.","756-w22-4r7ji 

that part from mouser should do the trick for a replacement. from the datasheet it looks to be about 4mm longer and ~1mm wider. electrical specs are the same."
taz 1.0 case fan,"hi all,

so i booted up my taz this evening and noticed the case fan did not switch on. i ran a short print with a different fan pointed at the electronics case; every other part of the printer seems to be functioning fine.

i finished the print, powered it down and opened the case to look for a problem. anyway, i unplugged the fan as the connection seemed to be loose, and now i can't remember where the case fan was plugged into ......

so the original problem could be a blown fuse, but can someone point out where on the board i need to plug the case fan into? what a silly problem...

http://reprap.org/wiki/file:rambo-conn-main.jpg","fans are directional. they only flow air in from the front of the fan, out through the back. to change the direction of the fan, you must unmount and physically turn it. swapping polarity will burn the motor out. it should be blowing cool air from outside the case into it under normal circumstances. the overpressure will force the warmer air out through the top vents. you can tell which part of the fan is the ""back"" by looking at where the bracket that holds the rotating piece of the fan is. that part should be on the rear of the fan, and air exhausts out the side with the bracket and is drawn in through the non bracketed venturi side."
frakentaz? building a taz from a prusa i2?,"hello all!

newbie to the forum. little background for you. i entered the 3d printing industry when my boss decided on a whim to purchase a makerbot replicator for me to play with (as if he thinks i'm going to sit there like a monkey pumping out inventions for him!). anyway, within a month i was hooked! by october 2012 i had already decided to build my own prusa i2 printer from scratch (""ecksbot"") using my replicator to print the rp parts.

$400 over budget and about 200 hours later, i had a semi-working prusa i2. unfortunately the design was horrible, my x and y axis weren't secured well to the linear bearings. ultimately i shorted my azteeq x1 control board hotbed thermistor, and had to print in pla only. this was fine until i jammed the hotend.  obviously i could fix the printer, but i hated the design, i decided i'd scrap the printer and start fresh.

fast forward to february 2012, i decided i wanted to build a delta 3d printer, so i purchased a rostock max kit. that printer is working fairly well, but i still have a dead prusa i2 and a whole bunch of spare parts just itching to be re-used.

now, it's time to begin planning what to do with my prusa.  initially, i wanted to build a mendelmax2.0, but was recently pointed to the lulzbot taz via reprap.org. so far i've been very impressed with what i'm seeing.

however, i'm a bit confused. from what i understand, the taz is open source, and the stl's and bom is available for download.  can someone show me where to find this information? i haven't been successful in finding any information beyond links to the store. 

tl;dr - where can i get information on how to build a lulzbot taz from scratch? 

thanks all!","orias wrote:i'm thinking about doing something similar with my prusa i2. i'm thinking of making a taz mini, similar to this: http://forum.lulzbot.com/download/file. ... &mode=view

where they used the same taz printed parts, but reduced the rod/extrusion measurements by 100mm. i haven't gone through things to see if i can shim up my 8mm rods to be used. the z axis bearing mounts may need to be changed to accommodate 8mm pillow block bushings or lm8uu linear bearings. i'd rather not have to replace the precision ground smooth rod for this, as the smaller taz may not need the larger diameter rods.

has anyone ever considered using a maker-slide for the y-axis?  just curious. 


thanks for all the input so far, i'm sure you'll be hearing from me a lot in the next few months once i start the build."
even bed heating - possible?,"i know lulzbot is working on a new heated bed (which i'll definitely buy as an upgrade when it's available), but the current bed has relatively uneven heating across the surface.  has anyone found any way to mitigate this when you have very large prints?

i'm about 11 hours into a ~20 hour print of what is basically a 200mm x 200mm box - so it covers 3/4 or so of the taz bed.  i just noticed all four corners are starting to warp upwards a bit.  the printer is in an enclosure (unheated, but it retains the heat reasonably well) and smaller parts that are close to the center of the bed print wonderfully with zero warping.  the bed had a fresh coat of abs glue before starting the print.

i may look into using a heater to keep the build enclosure actively heated to a certain temperature, but i'm trying to avoid that since the electronics are in the enclosure with the printer right now and i'd like to avoid rewriting things if possible.

- adam","adambyram wrote:thanks bam,

i don't have easy access to any aluminum or copper plating, but i do have a roll of pet tape i'm going to try, so thanks for that suggestion.

after looking at my print, it looks like the bed itself isn't causing the problem as much the abs shrinkage is.  some corners of the box i printed warped upwards and left the box walls more or less solid.  the walls above the corners that did not warp ended up cracking open...so it looks like the abs is going to relieve the pressure from shrinking by either warping or cracking.  so more consistent bed heating may have held all corners down, but that would have likely caused more cracking elsewhere.  this is all with an enclosure too.  

it looks like i just can't print big, reasonably solid objects in abs, so i'm going to break the model into smaller sections and reassemble them with abs glue afterwards.

sounds like a plan. have you tried adding a ~4-6mm brim to your part? that will also do wonders for keeping things stuck, but require some cleanup afterward

binding / stiction on the z axis leaving extruder unlevel,"hi,
i am noticing an issue with our fairly new taz printer. the z axis seems to be sticking or binding between the vertical smooth rod and white ""fingery"" bushings on the righthand side. the result is that as the z height is changed, the righthand side of the z gantry stays put for a short while after the motors start to move (the height change is taken up by the printed wave spring, which deforms slightly), then suddenly jumps up or down. the height after the jump is incorrect (some deflection still on the wavespring), causing the bed leveling to effectively be off from one run to the next. the (hysteresis / backlash / stiction) is always on the righthand side, regardless of the position of the extruder, so it doesn't seem to be a weight / gravity issue.

the smooth rod is clean and free of debris, and there have only been a handful of prints done on this machine. the manual also warns not to apply lubricant. is there an adjustment or other recommended means to fix this?","a couple things to check. there are two threaded rods, one on either side of the taz frame, that control up and down movement. if one of those rods is turning at a different rate, or not turning at all, you will see that happen. check the couplers from the threaded rod to the motors and verify they are tight and the zip ties are intact. also check and make sure that the rod itself is able to turn and isn't bound up on one side inside the acme nut. make sure the couplers aren't getting hung up on anything either.

another thing that can cause binding is if the x carriage is already out of level significantly. check and make sure your carriage is not up on one side more than it is on the other by measuring from a common point down to the motor mount. if it is off, this can put friction on the threaded rod and cause it to stick. to fix that, turn the threaded rod manually on one side until both x ends are level, then re-home the machine and try running back up and down the z axis a few times.

if that all looks like it is working, make sure both motors are cabled correctly and there are no nicks or breaks in the cable

1013's dual acme nut x ends will also prevent such issues from happening in the future, though you'll want to get your existing x ends working before you upgrade."
cylinder shifting,"i'm trying to print a tall cylinder, and i've noticed that the higher it gets, the more ""off"" the rings are.

here is the bottom, which looks good:


here is the top, which has gotten messed up:


from searching through the forum, i guessed it might be related to 2 things, either it's somehow related to the temperature being cooler the farther away from the heated bed it got, or something related to vibrations of the printer itself.  i'm not sure how to truly test if there are small vibrations, the printer is on a level surface and i printed a large, flat base to keep it from tipping.  

should i try and create some kind of enclosure to keep the temperature more consistent, or am i perhaps completely off base with what the problem likely is?

thank you!","it looks like the shift is only in one direction....do you remember which way it was oriented on the machine, so you can tell which axis shifted.

i would also go thru and tighten all the screws that hold the motors on, and the little allen screw that holds the belt cog onto the motor shaft....shoot, just check that all screws are tight."
x-axis shifting with large prints,"hi everyone, i'm trying to print a larger item that is basically has a flat bottom with walls, and the walls are severely shifted.  i've tried tightening my belts, but it doesn't help.  smaller items, such as the octopus test print, are fine, it's only larger items that have this issue.  does anyone have any suggestions?

here is a picture of the whole object printed with the shift:



it has been getting worse, here is the latest print, stopped early because of how bad it was:



i've also attached the gcode file i used (i can attach the stl if anyone would like to see it, but i figured the gcode file would have more info about the settings i'm using).

thank you!","thanks piercet, here are some pictures:

1) the original motor side:


2) i then loosened the set screws and moved the flat part all the way close to the motor, but the belt still moved around on the other side, so i moved the flat part to various different locations on the shaft until the top and bottom part of the belt seemed as lined up as they'd be.  after every small move, however, i tried moving the extruder back and forth, but the belt still moved and hung over the end.  here is how the motor side ended up, with the belt a little better aligned, though this didn't fix it:



3) one thing i noticed is that the bottom part of the belt seems to move quite a bit vertically as the extruder moves back and forth.  this first picture is what it looks like when it's on the opposite side from the motor.  as you can see, the belt is so low that it's hitting the black plastic piece underneath and forcing the belt into a slight angle downward:



this next picture is what it looks like when the extruder is in the middle of the x-axis, and as you can see the belt has moved up:



this last picture is what it looks like when it's all the way on the side close to the motor.  it's moved up so much that it now seems to rub the underside of the tensioner, or at least is extremely close to doing so:



i've checked for anything that's loose anywhere, but i can't find anything anywhere that seems loose, or in any other way looks out of place.  the printer is new, so i haven't even done much with it yet other than a few small things, since i can't get it to print this piece that is important to a project i'm working on.  thank you for the belt tensioner link, i will try that out to make tightening the belt easier."
taz y-axis failure,"my print was going well so left it unattended for a little while, came back to quite a surprise.
i still haven't done an investigation to find out the exact reason for the failure, but the belt clamp was actually ripped off the y-plate and then torn in half.

after looking at the part i was printing i noticed that the entire part was angled in the y- direction, so i should've been able to tell that something wasn't quite right earlier if i was paying enough attention   





p.s. in case you haven't noticed this is my own custom build, so would be surprised if people encountered the same issue with one from lulzbot","gannon, something else to look for is how slic3r slices the holes, circular holes can be rendered smaller or larger than in the stl depending on settings used which can cause the thermal inserts to be pulled out relatively easily.

cabage_breath, off the top of my head there aren't too many i would print below 75%. it's worth it for long term reliability of parts to infill at 85% or above. from personal experience on my machine i built at home, you can get away with 50% infill on the extruder body/idler, the bed fingers and maybe bed corners. otherwise, the more rigid the parts that make the frame, the better."

does anyone know what i'm doing wrong? 

i'm using an 0.5 nozzle, as the designer and most of the success stories on thingiverse indicate. i've been reading extensively (http://forums.reprap.org/read.php?262,132070,133925 - http://forums.reprap.org/read.php?262,163546,163823 - http://forum.seemecnc.com/viewtopic.php?t=1009&p=4253), experimenting (going fast, going very slow, bridge flow ratio, cutting the filament diameter, 0.2 to 0.3 layer heights, lowering the extrusion multiplier, temperatures from 170 - 200, even lowering the nozzle diameter) and thus far haven't hit it yet. 

has anyone ever printed a model like this on the taz? with 0.1mm xy tolerance i would think it'd be doable, and clearly others with different equipment are printing it fine, one even with slic3r?","orias wrote:are you using a fan? abs or pla? if pla you'll really want to install a fan. your prints will improve tremendously. ideally the fan would blow on the top couple of layers of the printed object, not just on the nozzle as some mounts are trying. you'll find that it may not be too much extrusion, but when it's printing in air it's not cooling fast enough. it can get pulled back in when the print head moves back. it's hard to tell without seeing your gcode file/slic3r config.

thank you for replying!

printing with pla. i did build and install a fan. see http://forum.lulzbot.com/viewtopic.php?f=36&t=384 - would love your comments on the adequacy of this particular fan mount or any suggestions for a different one. i fear anything attached the nozzle will spend as little time on that drooping overhang as the nozzle itself does. which is to say, very little at all. have also tried larger fan aimed at the print bed - results not good. 

in terms of gcode or slic3r config - i have about 20 attempts.  i've attached an example. i tried all kinds of things, and got all kinds of dramatic variations in the print, but never to those sloppy overhangs. i did not try enabling supports. since this is designed to print an interlocking part, i was afraid the supports would get into the spaces between the rings and mess it up. can give it a shot, though."

these low settings? what am i missing?","thanks for the replies, are you saying that i have to change all the files for the taz?

y-belt slipping,"i'm trying to do a 2 hour print.. and about an hour into it each time, the y belt slips (i can hear it) and then the print head is offset in the y-direction from the already printed part.

how can i fix this?","i don't have a taz so this may not be any help, but i ran into the same type of offset with my ao-100, it ended up being one of the z axis couplers was loose, so the printer was not raising high enough on one side and was actually hitting the side of the part, which caused it to skip on the belt. the belt itself wasn't the issue, but the coupler where it joined the nema 17 motor to the threaded rod was juuust loose enough that it was managing to work itself loose over a longer print, but apperently managed to settle back to starting position by the time i tried the next print. took me a while to figure out what was going on. if your belts look fine you might want to start there?"
taz batch 2,"i saw the taz batch 2 orders are now open here:

level and thickness?,"why is that there are 20 different descriptions of both leveling and setting first layer thickness???

i can get the bed perfectly level (of course, any temperature change and that changes ).... but i'm sorry the description of how to set the first layer thickness is just all over the map.

the manuals says to do it such that you have a well formed *round* with a slight flat on the bottom where it's adhering.  other people say do it with a piece of paper - yeah right, did that, first layer comes out *flat*.

so i decide to stay with the paper and i wanted to print a small round cylinder with a hole in the middle of it.

i *always* get a distinctive ridge around the first layer that is wider than what is being printed, because the layer is too thin and squeezed out. - and this from the paper setup.

btw, if i setup for as the manual describes round with a slight flat where it adheres.  there is enough variance in the bed temperature from point a to point b that the highs and low of the bed will pull the filament loose in spots and screw up the print... 

and no a raft isn't the answer.

either you all will accept the first layer being something you have to *clean* up every time and can have no detail, or i'm just doing something wrong... but i'm tired of it and on a hunt for how to do it correct such that you can have detail if you want on your first layer... 

so, i'm open to suggestions and with pictures if you don't mind as all these words don't seem to be read the same by any two people??

anyone got what they think is a best practices for 1 layer setup?  level i can handle 

thanks,
alan

p.s. yes, i'm using lutz juice too btw","so what i've been experimenting with is something similar to what 1013 posted above.

i would start my print, let the 2 lines of perimeter print and the first layer start... if i was getting a squished layer, i would stop it, adjust the stop knob to raise the platform, re-home and repeater until i had it at a layer thickness that looked good.

my last 2 prints doing that turned out amazingly good... also adding the linear bearings helped greatly.  i'm still getting a little bit of what i think it *melt* on the first layer... even with it adjusted as above, where the first layer is just barely sticking, after a full print is finished, i still get a bit of an edge on that first layer.  i'm printing at 230 on the nozzle and 85 on the bed in abs... maybe those need to be dropped down a bit?

i just printed a fan mount so i'm going to be adding that as well... i need to remember to get some connectors for it...

it's coming together, but this again proves that there is no default setup that will work for this. each location on the bed is at a very different temperature and so there is no way you can have one adjustment that will work for the entire bed.

i'm also thinking that there is some hysteresis on the z axis that i need to resolve.  i've got most of 1013's modifications printed, i need to check a few things and get those installed and see if i can't resolve that area of weakness.

not necessarily slipping, but there is rotational flex, which will mean z-axis errors when it raises and lowers (hysteresis errors). you can see this yourself by rotating the threaded rods by hand while the motors are on and holding position. they will rotate 5 or 10 degrees in both directions.


ok. i will conduct a simple experiment to measure this backlash as soon as i get this thing finished (~1.5-2 months away). 

a very tight hose clamp or two on each coupler would minimize this hysteresis, no?

a clamp won't get rid of the problem 1013 is talking about. the issue is due to a material property. i heard that there are a lot of production printers that use the tubing method with no issues."
bed plate metric -> imperial conversion,"if anybody with solidworks 2013 (or whichever solidworks was used to create this file: http://downloads.lulzbot.com/lulzbot/ta ... _ra.sldprt) reads this, would you be willing to convert the file from metric to imperial and reupload it as .pdf and .sldprt files?

it would help me out a lot! my version of solidworks is 2010 and it can't open that file. my milling professor says we can make this thing if i convert everything to imperial. it would be a lot cleaner than trying to edit the .pdf...

thanks!","solidworks versions are not backward compatible. a native sw 2013 file cannot be opened by an older version. and sw 2013 cannot save in an older version. this is done on purpose by dassault solidworks to force its users toward an upgrade path. this seems devious and abusive, but most cad industry big players do the same.

what can be done is to export the file to parasolid (*.x_t) taking care to save in an older version of parasolid, since each sw version comes with a new parasolid version. or maybe simpler, save as step which is a universal exchange format.

but that means that the model will be stripped of all history (features used to build it)."
"weird ""ribbing"" on my prints","



i can't figure out what is causing this ribbing effect on my print. config is attached. this is lulzbot pla printing at 185c, bed at 60c. i have two fans running, one is ducted and blowing on the print, the other is aimed at the extruder heatsink.

any thoughts?","i had to replace my hot-end this past week (long story there, but not important)... while i had that apart i was just tired of the probably 1/16"" of vertical and forward *play* that i had in the x axis... it was all from those igus (i think better termed i_suck) bearings.

the major problem with the ones that lulz uses is that they are the ones that are suppose to be used in a ""compression"" not free floating.   they - igus actually makes one that can be used in free floating applications.  i didn't try that, but may at some point.

anyway, i had ordered some of the 10mm linear bearings from china and ebay and so while i had most of the x axis apart i replaced the igus bearings with the linear ones.

wow, why did i wait so long!!! i was able to get just about all the noise out of the system with a little playing with how and in what order i tightened the screws putting it back together.... it look was was easily 10 thousandths or more probably closer to 20 out of the bearings and made it zero (or close to it).

after i got it back together, i dial calibrate checked the level of the x axis to the y axis smooth rods and tweaks just a smidge of difference out of that.  then i releveled the bed.

now i need to make 1013's other mods, but it was amazing the difference.  where i was wiping the nozzle before and you could just feel everything move forward and up, it doesn't do that any more.

if they want to stay with the plastic bearings at least move to the ones that aren't made for compression fit.

i've got enough linears to do all the other axis's as well which i'll do at some point in time....

very inconsistent z-level homing,"i've been having a heck of a time getting my prints started, because i usually have to try at least 10-15 times before i get one that will do a decent first layer. my problem is that when i'm setting my z-stop screw, the z-axis will be very inconsistent each time it calibrates itself. i'll have it dialed in perfectly, then it'll start a new print, and, even thought i just calibrated it 10 seconds earlier and the set screw has not changed, it'll decide to either start up to 2 mm higher or 1 mm lower than it is supposed to. this makes getting a good first layer much more of an art than a science. 

is there perhaps a way to slow down the z-axis when it's calibrating itself? this is getting to be a major headache.","i was having a similar issue on my mendelmax 1.5.  what i found out is that it was the way the firmware (marlin) does the homing command.  

this was the process:
1. my z axis is at zero, i check my layer height.
2. i adjust the screw to change the height slightly.
3. i tell the printer to home the z.
4. the z end stop switch is still activated, since i haven't adjusted the screw enough to deactivate the switch.
5. the firmware rasies the z axis slightly to try to get the switch to deactivate, but the throw on the switch is greater than this lift.
6. the firmware i guess goes into an error mode where it detected that lifting the z didn't deactivate the end stop.
7. it lowers the z axis, but for whatever reason, it ends up lower than it originally was, then calls this position 0.

so to get around this, now whenever i make a change to my screw, i lift the z axis 2mm, then i tell it to home.  i also removed the starting gcode that homes the axes.  i just make sure i home my axis myself before each print."

i want to print a few spare parts in case of any future needs.

which parts would you prioritize if you were doing this? extruder gears? x-axis? everything? :p","i find that using this: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:10735 eliminates the need to reprint the filament idler. it's a rather fast print, so replacement is easy. 

i have not had to remove the filament idler yet, so i haven't had to hunt down the captive nut. once you find it you may want to lock it in place with some heat or a weak lulzjuice solution.

if you are going to replace the whole idler, just pop out the old bearing and shaft by whatever means necessary. you can usually just push it out the back by applying pressure from the front. if you hold it by the top and bottom, the idler will flex slightly and open up a bit more to allow the shaft to pop out. make sure the new idler is cleaned well enough to allow the bearing to spin freely."

240 is a bit hot for our abs filament. i'm very cautious when approaching the upper limits of the hot end. keep in mind that the heater may overshoot the set temperature as it settles in to the desired temp. peek starts getting soft around 245c.  i always recommend raising the temperature in small 1 degree increments rather than large temperature jumps. it may take a little bit longer, but a conservative, measured approach has served me well. i've seen too many friends kill their hot end and other things by pushing things unnecessarily."
motor noise and layer fail in same position,just as the hot end reaches the corner of the print an increasing growling sound appears to be coming from the x axis motor. also the pla balls and comes up from the bed. this happened on two consecutive prints in the same place. using the hq config from lulzbot.,"is that a skirt that is supposed to be around the whole part?

it looks like the program (your part + your skirt offset) is larger than the print area of the machine.  i suspect the x axis is trying to go past the max travel and basically is jamming, and stalling the motor (that grinding sound your hear, is the stepper motor stalling).

these machines do not have a max travel limit switch (only a home/min travel limit), so if it is commanded in g-code to go to x 50,000mm or something, it will try to go that far, even though the machine cannot physically go that far. 

you'r part might be just a little too large. or you need to bring your skirt offset distance much closer, or even turn it off. your picture cuts off the bottom, but perhaps the part can be moved down some, or maybe rotated a few degrees to fit diagonally."

everything has been resolved with claudio.
however i still suggest better outlining replacement part sources and specific part # directly in your support section, a video would go a long way too for your support guides or pictures. 

basically it ended in i made the smallest mistake in getting a wrong length (3w output(like many other hotends use) instead of 7w) resistor, ( you should also note that i could have gotten a 4.7 ohm like the burned out one in my unit (could not read text on it due to damage)) and basically tough cookies on my thermistor that is exactly right but .16mm larger than the burnt out one and thus does not fit into the heater block. so my options are try to get a refund from digikey on something that costs almost nothing or file/machine out the hole and void the remainder of my buda 2.0 warranty.

regardless i won't be able to get this printer up & running for another week + at least as i am not going to get rush shipping again from digikey or any other source for $50.

my end decision here is i most likely will the components i need to get this up and running and then put in for a prusa nozzle or a b3 pico (if it ever releases). i would prefer a all metal hotend that can handle a powerful heater core with a consistent diameter instead of a resistor.

new printer calibration issue,"hi everyone, i just received my taz in the mail and have been trying to get it set up and calibrated.  i recently tried printing the octopus.gcode file to see if i can get mine to match as close as possible the octopus print sent with the printer.  the first time i tried, it was ok (my #1 picture below), but i noticed the bottom was not perfectly flat like theirs, and the legs were a little stringy, so i decided to try lowering the z-index a little.  

when i printed again, the bottom was nice and flat, but the print shifted quite a bit (my #2 picture below).  i stopped the print early, and raised the z-index a little to see if that is what caused the problem (didn't think it did, but i just wanted to get it back to where i started at least), and i could see that the shift is still there, just not as pronounced (my #3 picture below).

i've been reading through the forums and thought perhaps a belt was slipping or a screw was loose somewhere, but i can't find anything that looks wrong.  does anyone have any suggestions for how i can go about diagnosing where the problem is?  are there perhaps other prints i can use that will help detect which part has a problem, or something in particular i can look for while it's printing?  i have checked every screw i can find, every belt, etc, and things seem ok, but this is my first printer and i must be missing something.  i thought perhaps i'd messed up something with the y axis because before i started seeing the shifting, the cables coming off of the bed obstructed the y-axis end stop and when i homed the y axis, the motor kept running even though it was already as far as it could go.  i stopped it and fixed the problem with the cables, but i figured maybe something got screwed up.  i can't figure out what though, the belt seems tight and the screws seem fine.  any help is much appreciated!

dimension accuracy problem while printing with taz,"hi,

i have been doing several tests with the new lulzbot taz and i am having problems with dimensions both in xy plane as well as the z-axis. i have tried printing a 20mm x 20mm cube with through holes and i have tried printing 10mm x 10mm cube without any holes. 

both cubes have problems in terms of accurate dimension in all the three axis. i have checked the exported stl file and that is accurate.

there two kinds of problems we are facing:
1) with the 20mm x 20mm cube with holes, there is dimension error in xy plane and even more in the z-axis. see attached photos.
2) with the 10mm x 10mm cube without holes, there is dimension error in all the three axis and a substantial tapper with the lower layers being wider than the higher one. see attached photos.
3) i have also attached photos of a part (spiral cam) that we are using in one of our projects that show the difference i am talking about. you can see the 3d-printed part side by side with waterjet cut part.

we are an architecture and engineering firm and the dimensional accuracy in all the three axis along with the inner dimensions of the holes within a part, is really important to us. if we cannot achieve this, the 3d-printed part will be of no use. 

please suggest what you think we should be doing to correct the dimensional inaccuracy.

i have also attached the 'gcode' along with the 'slic3r ini file' of the configuration for your reference.

looking forward to hearing from you.

regards,
shivang","i hate to say this, but how much did you investigate the current 3d printing technology before you invested in one?

all but the 'spiral cam' seems within what i would expect. for that, i would think you have the first layer set very low - which is actually a good thing for making things stick to the bed. but obviously it reduces the height of your print.
also, does the layer height divide evenly into the height of the object? if not then it could miss off the top layer because that would make it too tall. try choosing a different layer height.

there are ways to improve calibration, have a read of these guides:

slightly off x and y axis dimensions,"hey all.

i am printing some cubes this afternoon on account of a couple parts this weekend printing too large.

i've printed a 15mm cube and while it is 14.999 - 14.87mm in the z direction (measuring in the middle of the cube yields smaller numbers, and measuring transverse vertexes gives 14.98mm or so  ), the x and y dimensions are ~15.55 (at the bottom-most layers) and ~15.25mm in the center and top most layers of the cube. i am using these calipers:http://www.amazon.com/stainless-digital ... b000yft0a2

i am printing a few more different sized cubes at the moment.

i am printing natural 3mm lulzbot abs, 230 hot end and 85 bed with an abs/acetone layer on the bed.

here is that 15mm cube's gcode. 

i can understand how the bottom couple layers could be squished out a bit, and can visibly see the wider layers at the bottom. 

these measurements aren't off that much but i am trying to snap fit a few parts and just working on gauging where my machine is.","how consistent are your results? if you can reliably show a variance of a couple of percent you can potentially tune that out by adjusting the steps per unit in the firmware. i would wait however until you were comfortable with operating the printer and understood what needs to be done to calculate the adjustments needed (not too awkward) and reflash the firmware, then print more test objects to slowly dial in the accuracy."
nozzle height,"i am still trying to get a good print and want to ensure that the bed is level. i ran the gcode file http://download.lulzbot.com/taz/calibra ... evel.gcode to test it. the results show that the bed isn't level.

in the manual on page 94, in figure 5.3 it shows the correct nozzle height. i find it very difficult to eye ball the distance the nozzle is from the glass bed, and would prefer to use feeler gauges at the four corners and adjust the heights till they are all at the same level. what would be a good gauge to use? 5mil?

edit:
after reading the replies to this thread i did the following.

home the x,y,z axes. placed a sheet of paper (i measured it to be just less than 5 mil) below the nozzle and adjusted the z axis endstop until i felt some resistance. raised the z axis, moved the x axis over. placed the paper below the nozzle and homed the z axes. i adjusted the fastener with the spring at this location until i had a similiar resistance as before. i repeated this at the other corners until i got back to the first position. then i centered the x and y axises and adjusted the z endstop until i had a similiar resistance on the paper.","orias wrote:i have always used the paper method for setting the first layer height as well. if the first layer is too flat for your liking, you can simply adjust the z axis endstop screw by a quarter turn or so until it's how you like it. 

i like having my first layer squished really, really low. and that's ok.  :p

ok so wait one darn minute.

so let me see if i get this. 

process as follows.

a) heat bed and nozzle to operating temp
b) set *home* z height  with the z stop to the thickness of a sheet of paper - so it will barely move when at home.
c) check and adjust level at the 3 remaining corner using the blocks/screws/springs
     - move z up one major click, move to new corner, home z only and adjust for thickness of paper
     - move to next corner and repeat
d) double check starting at *home* and repeat as necessary.

then *if wanted* adjust the first layer height for your liking?  (this means - yes, it can be squished flat if you like)...

that about have it?

wow, that is somewhat starkly different from what the manual says - yes, i'm a manual reader!

taz gears slipping.,"hi,

i wanted to log this issue in case someone else experiences it.  i want to express my gratitude to claudio for his patience.  

i noticed that my filament was not extruding properly so ran a few extrusion tests.  while running, i found that the gears were slipping and very little filament was being extruded.

after about an hour on the phone with video and photos, claudio found that the set screw for the gear on the stepper motor was loose.  after tightening it with the 1.5mm hex drive, the printer works again!!

thanks claudio!","thanks, glad he got you going."
new taz no movement,"i just got my taz setup and was checking to see if everything was working. i plugged the usb in and installed drivers. i started printrun and connected. it connects fine, however when i use any movement or really and command they don't work. both the taz and the psu are plugged in and on. i also see a green light from inside the taz.

edit: i also appears that the temperatures are working for both the bed and extruder.
edit2: i'm assuming there is supposed to be a fuse in the fuse receptacle on the psu. there isn't. if this is the case what are the specs. on the fuse, so i can get one.

any help would be appreciated.

thanks","1013 wrote:does the nozzle heat up?
no, neither does the bed. although they show the correct temps (room temp).

after checking the power supply closely i have concluded that it is missing a fuse. i checked for a closed circuit from the negative terminal where the power plug connects to the negative terminal inside the power supply and the circuit is open. this is the same for the positive with the unit turned on. meaning power isn't getting to the power supply."
first print: abs or pla,"what material, abs or pla, would be recommended for a first print? i read about adhesion problems with abs (and later about lulz juice) so i went with pla. from reading around a bit more, it seems like abs is more commonly used. what is easier to print though?","actually in the reprap type machine abs is used, but in other they are pla only, like the replicator 2.  the main reason people use abs is because its easier to finish and doesn't require a fan.  but others use pla because it smells better, doesn't need to be printed as hot, in fact you can print without a heated bed with pla.

i have printed with both and i prefer abs for the fact i can use an acetone vapor bath and smooth/shinny the print up."
goofy first layers,"hey all,

i'm trying to trouble shoot this problem which is occurring on some of my larger (~ 160mm) prints. 

i am thinking it has to do with the default extrusion width in slic3r. i was using some of lulzbot's profiles but making some changes to the speed, layer heights, and various other settings and didn't realize that the extrusion width was set to something besides 0. so this print might not have had an optimal extrusion width. 

however it could be something totally unrelated. i'm thinking it might be related to printing with a brim? 

also you may notice on the long, flat side of the object the layers are warping a bit as we travel up the z. the lower layers seem to be cooling at a different rate. this effect was much mroe pronounced when i was running the heated bed at 110c instead of 85c now.

any thoughts on why the first 8 layers or so look so much rougher than the rest of the print?","johnschneider89 wrote:1013 wrote:infill speed may be too high
what would cause this to affect only the first layers?

true.

what material are you using?
using any abs juice? or hairspray? (hairspray has been suggested to affect shrinking of the first few layers).

what is the % speed difference for the first layer? that would be my first look.

try printing with raft. it's more material to remove, but may give you the look you are going for. it will certainly remove any issues with a non-level bed."
